"3","'I'm A Man, Do Everything Openly': Nitin Gadkari On BJP's Goa Strategy"," HighlightsMr Gadkari told Amit Shah that they had lost Goa, should concede defeat
Mr Shah asked him to rush to Goa, devise a strategy to turn things around
He refutes charges of horse-trading to form BJP-led government in Goa
                                As soon as the assembly elections results in Goa were announced in March -- in which the Congress emerged as the single largest party with 17 of the 40 seats in its kitty, but failed to immediately decide on who should be the chief minister -- the BJP, with four seats less than the rival got busy gathering support of smaller parties. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, the BJP leader in charge of Goa, met leaders of regional parties and independent legislators to convince them to help form and be part of a BJP-led government in the state.

 Mr Gadkari today revealed how the BJP turned its defeat into victory in Goa and managed the required numbers for forming the government and agreeing to make the then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar the chief minister. He added that while ""the Congress was sleeping, his party worked all night to form the government"".

However, he refuted charges of horse-trading during the hectic overnight parleys. ""I am not a person who does political deals. I am a 'mard' and do everything openly. I did not carry any money to anyone in Goa. I don't do such things. I fight and get things done,"" the senior BJP leader and Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister said at the India Today Editors Roundtable in Delhi.

The party had got 13 seats and Mr Gadkari informed BJP national president Amit Shah that the party had lost Goa and should concede defeat. However, Mr Shah asked him to devise a strategy to turn things around.

Soon after their meeting, Mr Gadkari packed his bags and started for Goa, he said.

Once in Goa, he met Sudin Dhavalikar of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) at the Taj hotel in Panaji who agreed to form an alliance with the BJP on the condition that he be given a ministerial berth. With the MGP's support, BJP's strength went to 16 and then he was approached by Vijay Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party (GFP).

""He had been a Congress man for his entire life. But he was being tortured by the Congress for past five years. We had got Dinesh Singh, a wrestler from Uttar Pradesh, and is a friend of Sardesai. He convinced Sardesai,"" Mr Gadkari said.

Mr Sardesai, along with a ministerial berth, wanted Manohar Parrikar to be made the chief minister.

Around 2.45 am he rang up Mr Shah about the demand. ""I had asked Parrikar, he said he would do whatever party asked (him) to do. But, my reading of his mind was that he was more than happy to return to Goa. I told the same to Amit Shah,"" he said.

What followed next needs no guessing.

"4","High Court Mutes EVM (Vote Machine) Criticism... Not Even On Twitter Or Facebook","                             Coming to the defence of the Election Commission that has been the target of attacks from political parties over its voting machines, the Uttarakhand High Court on Friday barred political parties and others from criticising the use of these machines, or EVMs, in the five state assembly elections till pending election petitions are decided.

A systematic campaign has been unleashed against the EC, a constitutional body, a two-judge bench of the high court said. It ruled that the foundation of democracy would be weakened in case this tendency to damage constitutional bodies by levelling unsubstantiated allegations was not curbed. It added that the right of freedom of speech did not permit levelling unsubstantiated charges against the functionaries of the constitutional bodies.

""We, however, in the larger public interest, restrain"" all political parties, non-governmental organizations and individuals ""from criticising the use of EVMs in the recently conducted elections of the State Assemblies even by approaching the electronic media, press, radio, Facebook, Twitter etc. till the decision of the election petitions,"" the court said.

The verdict, which ends the no-holds barred attack launched by the Aam Aadmi Party, also puts a question mark on Arvind Kejriwal's plan to conduct a parallel hackathon on Saturday that taunted the election commission for its restrictive ground rules. Under these rules, AAP's Saurabh Bharadwaj said, even its look-alike EVM could not be tampered.

The court allowed the election commission to go ahead with the EVM Challenge that it was to hold on Saturday but frowned at the event nonetheless, observing that it ""may influence the outcome of election petitions wittingly or unwittingly"".

Only two parties, the Nationalist Congress Party and the CPI-M had applied to participate in tomorrow's EVM challenge conducted by the commission to put all concerns about the machine's reliability at rest. Representatives of the two political parties can, however, only fiddle with the buttons, and not open the machines.","new delhi:"
"6","Arvind Kejriwal's Hackathon Vs Election Commission's: What To Expect"," HighlightsPolitical parties had alleged vote machines can be rigged
Election Commission's challenge accepted by 2 parties
AAP rejects Election Commission's event, will hold its own hackathon
                                The Election Commission has organised more than 10 vote machines that were recently used in elections in Uttar Pradesh for tomorrow's hackathon, where political parties will try to prove in Delhi that the machines can be rigged.

A total of 14 Electronic Voting Machines or EVMs will be made available to representatives of Sharad Pawar's party NCP and the Left who hope to prove that the Election Commission is wrong and that the equipment used by it can be gamed, as alleged by a series of political outfits including the Congress and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party or AAP after Prime Minister Narendra Modi front-lined his party's gigantic wins in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

AAP, which has accused the Election Commission of colluding with the BJP to rig results in its favour, has announced that it will hold a parallel hackathon of its own tomorrow. The machine it will make available to techies and others is the one that was used by the party in the Delhi Assembly last month in a televised demonstration of its manipulation. The Election Commission said the machine used was a far cry from the real thing and rejected the result.

At the Election Commission's event, hackers will get five hours - from 10 am to 2 pm - and access to four machines each. The other EVMs will be kept as back up.","new delhi:"
"7","BS Yeddyurappa Will Be BJP's Chief Ministerial Face In Karnataka: Amit Shah","                             Former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa will be the BJP's chief ministerial face in the Assembly polls scheduled early next year, party president Amit Shah said on Friday.

During an interaction with the Press Trust of India, Mr Shah also indicated that Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani would be the party's choice for the top post in the state, asserting that it would win more than 150 seats in the Assembly polls slated later this year. The Assembly has 182 seats.

He, however, said the party has not yet decided on its chief ministerial face in Himachal Pradesh, which goes to polls along with Gujarat.

""It (Karnataka election) will be fought under Yeddyurappa,"" Mr Shah said.

Asked if it meant that Mr Yeddyurappa, who is the BJP's Karnataka unit chief, will be the chief ministerial face, he said, ""He will be.""

The Karnataka unit has been facing factional fight with a group headed by former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa targeting Mr Yeddyurappa's leadership.

To a question on the party's state of affairs in Karnataka, Mr Shah said he would visit the state soon. The party had recently taken action against some leaders, suspected to be behind the internal wrangling.

Asked whether Mr Rupani will be the party's CM face in Gujarat, Mr Shah said, ""He is already the chief minister.""

""What does it mean that he will be the chief ministerial face...,"" he said in a lighter vein.

Mr Yeddyurappa, 74, an influential Lingayat leader, had led the BJP to its maiden victory in the southern state in 2008, but was forced to resign following charges of corruption against him.

He floated his own outfit in 2011. Though his party performed poorly in the 2013 Assembly polls, it managed to wean away a substantial chunk of the BJP votes, leading to a rout of the BJP.

He returned to the BJP fold ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.","new delhi:"

"10","From 2024 Hold Lok Sabha Elections, Assembly Polls Simultaneously: NITI Aayog","                             The NITI Aayog has suggested a synchronised two-phase Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024 so as to ensure minimum 'campaign-mode' disruption to governance. Outlining the details, the policy think-tank has said implementing the proposal may necessitate ""a maximum one-time curtailment or extension of some state assemblies"".

It has made the Election Commission the nodal agency to look into the suggestion and recommended setting up of a working group of stakeholders for deciding a road-map for synchronised elections.

A report in this regard need to be finalised within six months and final blue-print will be ready by next March, as per draft three-year action agenda for 2017-18 to 2019-20. The draft report was circulated among the Governing Council members (consisting of chief ministers of all states and others) of the NITI Aayog on April 23.

The recommendation assumes significance as President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pitched for simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls.

""All elections in India should happen in a free, fair and synchronised manner so as to cause minimum 'campaign-mode' disruption to governance. We may begin work towards switching to a synchronised two-phase election from the 2024 election to the Lok Sabha,"" the NITI Aayog draft report says.

This would require a maximum one-time curtailment or extension of some state assemblies, it said.

""To implement this in the national interest, a focused group of stakeholders comprising constitution and subject matter experts, think-tanks, government officials and representatives of various political parties should be formed to work out appropriate implementation-related details.

""This may include drafting appropriate Constitution and statutory amendments, agreeing on a workable framework to facilitate transition to simultaneous elections, developing a stakeholder communication plan and various operational details,"" the draft report says.

President Mukherjee in his speech on the eve of this year's Republic Day had favoured holding Lok Sabha and assembly elections together. ""The time is also ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after Independence when elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously. It is for the Election Commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties,"" President Mukherjee had said.

PM Modi had in February made a strong pitch for simultaneous elections. ""It (simultaneous polls) will cause some loss to all, including us,"" he had said, and asked political parties to not look at the idea through narrow the prism of politics.

""One party or a government cannot do it. We will have to find a way together,"" he had said.

Elections are being held all the time somewhere or else in the country and continuous elections lead to lot of expenditure, PM Modi had said replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.

The prime minister had said over Rs. 1,100 crore was spent in holding the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and the expenditure shot up to Rs. 4,000 crore in 2014.

He had said that over a crore government employees, including a lot of teachers, are involved in electoral process and the continuous exercise thus causes maximum harm to the education sector.

Security forces also have to be diverted for electoral works across the year even while enemy country keeps plotting against the nation and terrorism remains a strong threat, PM Modi had said.","new delhi:"
"11","Supreme Court Seeks Centre's Response On Plea For VVPAT For Gujarat Polls","                             The Supreme Court has sought response of the Centre and the chief election commissioner on a plea filed a Gujarat Patidar leader seeking the use of either ballot paper or electronic voting machines with paper trail for the upcoming Assembly election in the state.

A bench of Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justices DY Chandrachud and SK Kaul issued notice to the Centre, the CEC, the Gujarat government and the state election commission, and sought their response in four weeks. The top court posted the matter for hearing to the first week of July.

Petitioner Reshma Vithabhai Patel, the convener of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti, which was in the forefront of the Patel quota agitation, claimed that EVMs were not ""fully reliable, foolproof, tamper-proof or hacker-proof"". The plea was dismissed by the Gujarat High Court on April 12.

The Election Commission should be asked to replace EVMs with ballot paper, or to ensure Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) for every EVM, she had demanded.

The Assembly election in Gujarat is due later this year. The plea by Ms Patel had also alleged that the names of thousands of members of a ""particular community"" were missing from voter lists in the 2015 municipal corporation polls. It had sought the court's direction to the poll panel to prevent this in future.

She has said that the high court has erred in not appreciating that the Supreme Court had passed its judgement on October 18, 2013, asking ensuring polling through EVMs with paper trail but despite that it has not been implemented by the the ECI and the State Election Commission.

In her plea, it was contended that the high court has erred in not appreciating that there are allegations that at the behest of the ruling party, the names of voters were deleted from voter lists in the last six municipal corporations elections held in 2015.","new delhi:"
"12","Digvijaya Singh Dropped As Congress In-Charge Of Goa, Karnataka"," HighlightsDigvijaya Singh led the Congress' campaign in the Goa polls
It failed to form a government, despite being the largest party
Assembly elections in Congress-ruled Karnataka will be held next year
                                The Congress has removed its senior leader Digvijaya Singh as the party's in-charge in Goa and Karnataka. The decision comes nearly a month after the Congress failed to form a government in Goa despite emerging as the single largest party, commissioning biting criticism of Mr Singh from his colleagues and ridicule from opponents. He has been replaced in Goa by A Chellakumar and Lok Sabha member KC Venugopal in Karnataka.

""Congress president Sonia Gandhi has assigned the tasks of looking after Karnataka and Goa affairs to new AICC teams. While KC Venugopal has been made general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, A Chellakumar has been made AICC in-charge of Goa,"" party general secretary Janaradan Dwivedi said in a statement.

In elections held in February, the Congress managed to win 17 of the total 40 seats in Goa. However, as it took too long to make up its mind on post-poll alliances, the BJP quickly stitched up partnerships with regional parties and formed the government under former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.

In his farewell speech in the Rajya Sabha last month, Mr Parrikar took a jibe at Mr Singh and said, ""My special thanks to honourable member Digvijaya Singh, who happened to be in Goa but did nothing so that I could form the government.""

The Congress' inability to form the government in Goa also led to the resignation of Vishwajit Rane - who was seen as a possible Chief Ministerial candidate in Goa - from the party. Mr Rane, now a BJP member, openly criticised Mr Singh and accused him of ""mismanagement"".

The Congress has removed Mr Singh, a former two-time Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, as its in-charge in Karnataka, one of the few states currently held by the party. Assembly elections in the state will be held next year and the Congress would not want to relive it Goa experience.","new delhi:"
"13","Meghalaya BJP Leader Quits Party Protesting Against Cattle Trade Rule","                             As the Central government confronts strong opposition to its new rule banning cattle trade for slaughter in south and the northeast, a BJP leader in Meghalaya has resigned in protest. Bernard Marak, a leader from Garo hills, had recently caused a stir by promising cheaper beef to people if they voted the BJP to power.

Assembly polls are due early next year in the hill state, where beef is a staple.

""I have decided to quit the party because I am a Christian and Garo first,"" Mr Marak said today, adding, ""The BJP is hurting the sentiments here on the beef issue. Tribal society has its own laws. The BJP is trying to push Hindutva.""

Mr Marak's cheaper beef offer earlier this week discomfited the party as its government at the Centre faced criticism about its new cattle trade rules. The state BJP distanced itself from Mr Marak's comments, calling those his own views. Meghalaya BJP chief Shibun Lyndoh said the party ""is not against people having beef"".

""Total beef ban is something that even people here do not support,"" he said, adding what was required in the state were regulations and hygienic slaughter houses.

The BJP is yet to comment on the exit of the leader, who commands a chunk of the tribal votes.

""Bernard is right to the extent that there are people in the BJP in Meghalaya who eat beef... In Meghalaya it is not the BJP's agenda to put a beef ban,"" said senior BJP leader Nalin Kohli. But he denied that the party will push for cheaper beef if it comes to power. ""It is not the BJP's agenda to run markets that sale beef. That is for the market to decide. What Bernard says is his personal view not the party's view. ""

The new cattle trade rule of the Centre, that has triggered widespread protests in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, says cattle sold in animal markers cannot be used for slaughter. After Kerala and West Bengal, Tripura's Left government has said it will not implement the rule, describing it as ""anti-people"".","new delhi:"
"15","Shaking Up Elections, Corporate Tax: What India's 3-Year Plan Looks Like"," HighlightsNITI Aayog proposes 3-year agenda after PM meets Chief Ministers
Suggests simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024
Corporate tax holiday for job creators, farm tax reform also suggested
                                Any talk of taxing farm incomes turned out to be a political hot potato but NITI Aayog's three-year action agenda - discussed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Ministers last week - has set out several ambitious goals.

One of the most far reaching suggestions by NITI Aayog is to hold simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024. The report says, ""There should be synchronized two-phase elections even if that means curtailing or extending the tenure of some assemblies in national interest.""

The action plan says that the Election Commission should form working groups of stakeholders and submit a report by March 2018.

On curbing black money, the action plan says tax rates should be moderate and transparent. Real sector should be reformed and Aadhaar should be linked to real estate transactions, it says.

The most interesting part is with regard to taxes on agricultural incomes. On Wednesday, NITI Aayog had claimed that member Bibek Debroy's suggestion - that ultimately the rural sector including agriculture should be taxed - was his personal view.

But the final report said: ""All agricultural income is currently exempt from income tax regardless of its size. While the provision is meant to protect farmers, non-agricultural entities sometimes use it to evade taxes by declaring agriculture as the source of their income. In order to mitigate the generation of black money, the loopholes need to be plugged.""

Another ambitious project is to create well-paid jobs. Comparing India with China's job growth, the report says, ""Many super competitive firms in China today employ not just tens of thousands of workers but hundreds of thousands of them. In contrast, there are hardly any firms in India employing hundreds of thousands of workers.""

NITI's action plan says companies that create 10,000 jobs within three years of setting up should be given a corporate tax holidays for five years. It has also suggested zero per cent GST for six years to companies that employ 20,000 workers.

Other suggestions include setting up coastal employment zone and faster labour reforms.

At Confederation of Indian Industry's annual session on Friday, the head of NITI was blunt about the private sector's track record of creating jobs.

""Why I do not see a single industrialist putting up a factory of 250,000 workers doing apparel?"" asked Dr Arvind Panagariya.

At the moment, NITI Aayog's draft report has been circulated among state governments for their will give their feedback and suggestions before the policy think tank finalises India's growth roadmap.","new delhi:"

The BJP won only 3 seats in the 2015 Delhi assembly election

Mr Shah also wrote off the Aam Aadmi Party, which came a feeble second, mocking Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for blaming his party's drubbing on electronic voting machines or EVMs.

Delhi was won for the BJP by its booth-level workers, Mr Shah said at a celebration of his party's win with party workers and new corporators in the capital. The BJP has won 181 of 272 seats in three corporations. AAP could win only 48.

""Kejriwal-ji might blame EVMs for our victory, but to know the real reason, meet our booth in-charge,"" said Mr Shah, whose winning strategy in Delhi included sacking most sitting corporators to beat any anti-incumbency sentiment after 10 years of the BJP dominating the Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD.","new delhi:"

Mr Kejriwal to meet all 64 AAP legislators one on one, get feedback
Changes in AAP's national team expected, Mr Vishwas to get bigger role
                                A week after he was dealt a deadly blow in the Delhi civic elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has begun reconstructive surgery of his Aam Aadmi Party, starting with an outreach to the over 60 legislators who had won the party a massive mandate in assembly elections in the national capital just two years ago. Up ahead, said sources, are major changes in the party's leadership structure that could see leaders like AAP's founder member Kumar Vishwas play a greater role.

Mr Kejriwal pacified an upset Mr Vishwas yesterday by removing from a key party post Amanatullah Khan, a Delhi legislator who had accused him of attempting to replace the party chief. Many AAP lawmakers from both Delhi and Punjab had backed Mr Vishwas against what they saw as an attempt to scuttle his chances at being elevated in the party; he is currently only responsible for overseas funding.

From today, Mr Kejriwal will meet each of his 64 Delhi legislators one on one and will gather feedback on the party's work at the ground level. He will also meet AAP's volunteers, seen as the young party's backbone in its dream surge to prominence, but who seem to have lost steam after successive defeats this year - first in the Punjab and Goa assembly elections and then the drubbing the Delhi civic polls.

Mr Kejriwal has been accused of losing touch with the grassroots in recent days as his ambitions to expand AAP nationally have grown and sources close to him said he is keen to refurbish his image of a transparent and accessible leader. They also said that he is being extremely cautious in determining new roles for leaders in AAP.

Kumar Vishwas had on Saturday rued that the AAP chief is now surrounded by ""yes men"" who misguided him into blaming what he alleged were rigged electronic voting machines or EVMs for his party's loss to the BJP in Delhi.

A meeting called by Mr Kejriwal of top AAP leaders later assessed that the election drubbing in fact indicates an urgent need for organisational restructuring. Top leaders like Sanjay Singh, Dilip Pandey and Durgesh Pathak resigned last week from key party posts owning responsibility for the Delhi defeat and Mr Kejriwal will first appoint a new Delhi AAP team. He has already named Delhi minister Gopal Rai to head it in Dilip Pandey's place.

Changes in the national team are expected next, said sources, and that is when Mr Vishwas is expected to be given a bigger role by Mr Kejriwal, though it is not known yet what that role will be.","new delhi:"

"23","MCD Election Results 2017: A Trademark PM Modi Tactic, Used To Win Delhi, Could Repeat In Gujarat"," HighlightsBJP fielded fresh faces in Delhi polls, dropped most sitting councillors
Party might replicate strategy in Gujarat assembly polls later this year
BJP performed extensively well in the UP elections last month
                                The BJP's standout strategy for the Delhi civic polls was the decision to drop almost all sitting councilors and field fresh faces. It did this to skirt an anti-incumbency sentiment amid allegations of corruption and non-performance in the three corporations, which it has dominated for years. The party's campaign stressed that it was bringing in fresh faces and fresh energy.

It worked. The BJP has won all three municipalities with a bigger margin than last time, and there is already talk about whether the party will look at replicating the strategy in the next big election it faces - the Gujarat assembly elections due at the end of this year. But, Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi's tweet today notes, the strategy was originally applied in Gujarat by then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

""Narendra bhai had once replaced all Councillers in Guj & won 2/3 seats in local elections. Same strategy worked in MCD,"" Bihar's Mr Modi tweeted. PM Modi, as Chief Minister of Gujarat for 13 years, had in fact made it a practice to not field many sitting legislators in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 assembly elections too. In 2012, the BJP had dropped 40 per cent of its legislators opting for new candidates. Each time it won big.

The BJP has been in power in Gujarat for more than 19 years and could need to fall back upon the Modi strategy more than ever in the face of a build-up of the anti-incumbency factor. The party has struggled with containing the massive Patel agitation for reservation in government jobs and colleges and had a scare in 2015 when the Congress made inroads in rural areas in local body elections.

The BJP's superlative performance in the Uttar Pradesh elections last month - it won more than 300 of the state's 403 seats - has energised the party cadre in Gujarat as has an early start to its election campaign with both PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah making frequent visits to the state.

All the three sides have fielded 69 candidates for the seats. In the alliance, the Congress alone fields only nine candidates, the other 60 are represented by the ruling Samajwadi Party. After the relatively calm two phases, this phase is also expected to be calm as voters queue up to make their choice.

Among the candidates, contesting this Sunday, there are no heavyweights fielded from Mayawati's BSP. But, both BJP and SP will witness the test of fate for some of its most promising leaders.

Although, Ms Joshi has been in politics for nearly two decades, it is only few months ago that she made the switch from Congress into the BJP.

Also contesting is Samajwadi Party heavyweight, Shivpal Singh Yadav, Mulayam Singh's brother. Mr Shivpal has been in the eye of the storm for the last few months as the family feud of the Yadav clan came in the public eye.

"54","Remove PM, Ministers' Photographs From Official Websites, Election Commission Tells Centre","                             The Election Commission has ordered the Centre to remove photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers from government websites, insisting that all references to political leaders in official websites violated the model code of conduct.

Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha has also been told to explain why the central government hadn't removed references to the politicians from its websites so far.

The code of conduct had come into force from 4 January when the panel announced the schedule for elections to the five states, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur. The polls are already over in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa and two of the seven phases in Uttar Pradesh have been completed. Manipur will go to polls in March.

The EC letter sent over the weekend recalled that the commission had specifically mandated ""removal of all references of ministers, politician or political parties available on central/state government's official website"" in January.

It realised that the Centre hadn't complied with its instruction when someone complained how the website of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - that was being implemented in Uttar Pradesh - gave the BJP an unfair advantage since it had PM Narendra Modi and Union Housing Minister M Venkaiah Naidu's pictures.

The panel told the government to not only fix this website but also ""ensure that websites of other ministries/departments"" do not contain such photographs.

A key objective of the code is to ensure a level playing field for all political parties contesting elections and cap the possibility of the ruling party using government resources to its advantage.

Years ago, this meant taking down - or covering - government hoardings with pictures of the ministers.

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha General elections, the commission ordered the NDA government to mask pictures of then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on hoardings along the National Highways. Eight years later, the poll panel told the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh to drape the chief minister's statues, and of the elephants - that are her party, BSP's election symbol - at Ambedkar parks in Lucknow and Noida.

The same principle was later applied in cyber space, and the rule to remove all references to politicians from official websites introduced. In UP, many district officers have suspended their local websites rather than go through the trouble of scanning individual webpages.","new delhi:"
"65","Uttar Pradesh Election 2017: Voting Begins In 73 Constituencies","                             The first of seven phases in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, which is considered to set the tone for the 2019 Union elections, will take place today with over two crore people eligible to vote across 73 constituencies. A total of 839 candidates - including the key parties of BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance as well as the Rashtriya Lok Dal and independents - will contest the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts of western Uttar Pradesh.

With 26 contestants, Agra South will see the maximum number of candidates while Hastinapur will the least number of candidates - six.

According to the Association for Democratic Reforms, approximately 40 per cent of the BJP candidates in phase-1 have declared criminal cases against them, the most, followed by the BSP with a close 39 per cent. The SP-Congress alliance has 28 per cent candidates with criminal cases whereas the RLD has 33 per cent such candidates in the first phase.

Elaborate security arrangements have been made in all districts. Of the 887 polling centres in Muzaffarnagar, 600 have been instilled with video cameras. Around 6,000 paramilitary personnel are also being deployed in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts.

While the SP hopes to retain power - albeit with the Congress this time, the BJP and BSP hope to regain power in the state after 13 and five years, respectively.

The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 Union elections, decimating the Congress, SP and BSP - which were reduced to five, two and zero seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The election in Uttar Pradesh - along with those in Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand - is considered to be a referendum on Mr Modi's demonetisation drive. In his campaigns across Uttar Pradesh, Mr Modi urged voters to root out 'SCAM' - an acronym for Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.

Ms Mayawati is expected to be a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, should the BSP win. Her party was the worst sufferer in the state in the 2014 Union elections as it failed to register a single seat. This time, the party has fielded a record number of candidates belonging to the Muslim community, considered to be a key vote bank for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.

The poll is also a crucial test for the new national president of Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, who gained control of the party after a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister has forged an alliance with the Congress and lately, Rahul Gandhi and Mr Yadav have been jointly campaigning all over Uttar Pradesh. The Congress will contest 24 seats whereas the Samajwadi Party has given tickets to 51 contestants in the first-phase.

Among the 2.6 crore people eligible voters, around 1.4 crore are male, 1.2 crore are female whereas there are a little over 1,500 voters from the third gender.

According to sources, Sonia Gandhi who has been indisposed for some time and has not been active in handling party work for a few months now, is all set to campaign in Uttar Pradesh but will restrict herself to Rae Bareli.

Ending speculation on whether she will campaign in Uttar Pradesh after Congress forged a pre-poll alliance with Samajwadi Party in the state, Sonia reportedly confirmed that she will campaign in her Rae Bareli constituency.

Sonia Gandhi did not campaign in Punjab and Goa and is yet to canvas in Uttarakhand.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Yadav also dismissed reports of intra-party differences after his brother Shivpal Yadav, who has been sidelined in the party, talked about floating a new outfit post the Assembly polls.

""There is no bickering...Akhilesh will be the next Chief Minister...I will campaign (for the alliance) from tomorrow,"" Mr Yadav told reporters on Parliament premises when asked about his opposition to the alliance and his reluctance to campaign for it.

Mr Yadav also played down reports of Mr Shivpal, who was locked in a bitter battle with Akhilesh over control of SP, planning to form new party post assembly polls in the state.

""No one is unhappy...he (Shivpal) has not spoken to me or anyone in the party. He may have said out of anger...now leave it, there will be no new party,"" he asked.

Punjab saw a voter turnout of 70 per cent till 5 pm and Goa saw record 83 per cent voters turn up, said Election commission officials.

After hectic campaigning in the states Mr Kejriwal, along with Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia returned to the national capital. A known movie buff, he watched Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Raees' along with Mr Sisodia.

""These elections were fought by the people for the people. They spent money, campaigned door to door,"" he said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

Expressing confidence that AAP will win the elections, Mr Kejriwal said, ""It was an election of hopes. People have high hopes, and we will together fulfil those hopes."" The leader reserved special thanks for the NRI supporters, who helped the party in the polls, terming them as ""amazing people"".

In the same breath, Mr Kejriwal alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government harassed the donors of Aam Aadmi Party.

The Aam Aadmi Party has debuted in these states, in a bid to expand their presence beyond Delhi where they had a landslide victory in 2015. The party has not named a Chief Ministerial candidate, though its lawmaker Bhagwant Mann, AAP's tallest leader in the state, is reportedly top seeded.

Congress governments before his would have done it, PM Modi said, if there was any electoral benefit to be derived. The PM's address comes in the middle of crucial assembly elections in five states and just ahead of voting for the first of seven phases in Uttar Pradesh.

Replying to a motion of thanks to the President's address at the start of the Budget session, the Prime Minister hit back at opposition leaders who criticised the notes ban in their speeches during the debate. ""You would have done this first, but this is not about keeping the seat of power, it entails a lot of hard work, so was not a priority for you. No worries. We do not shy away from work,"" PM Modi said.

He countered critics who have accused him of taking a hasty decision by saying, ""Nothing was done in haste. To understand that you will need to study Modi.""

"103","RBI Raises Weekly Cash Withdrawal Limit To Rs. 50,000 From Feb 20, Limits End Mid-March","                             Starting February 20, you can withdraw upto Rs. 50,000 per week from your savings account, the Reserve Bank of India said today, adding that from March 13, all caps on access to cash will end.

For now, the withdrawal per week for every savings account cannot exceed Rs. 24,000. Any money you pull out using an ATM machine counts towards this.

Restricted access to cash was announced on November 8 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he disclosed that within hours, 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would be abolished. People were given till the end of December to deposit the outlawed notes in accounts or swap them for new ones. Deposits over 2.5 lakhs would be scrutinized for tax evasion, the government said later.

The PM's demonetisation move was aimed at punishing tax evasion and corruption. Yesterday, he defended the timing of the reform - it was introduced in the middle of the festival and wedding season and as farmer were sowing their winter crop - and said that the notes ban could only have been induced when the economy was flourishing.

 The cash shortage that encompassed India in the weeks after the high-denomination notes were banned resulted in long lines at banks and ATMs. 86%of the currency in circulation had been sucked out in one go. The new, security-enhanced 500 and 2,000-rupee notes were in short supply, adding to the crunch. The pain was especially sharp in rural India with its limited access to banks and its complete dependence on cash transactions. The government has said the move has helped steer the economy towards digital transactions.

However, critics point out that there is no estimate yet from the RBI on how much of the abolished money has been returned to banks -most reports say virtually all the banned notes were turned in, demolishing the theory that black or untaxed money would be destroyed by the reform.

Elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh are being seen as the first real test of the PM's decision. He has, in one speech after another in the strategically vital state of Uttar Pradesh, stressed that the notes ban seeks to punish the corrupt and return to the poor ""what is rightfully theirs.""

Earlier, the Reserve Bank of India had refused to enhance the cash withdrawal limit for election candidates despite a request from the poll commission. But today, the central bank removed cash withdrawal limits from current accounts, cash credit accounts and overdraft accounts with immediate effect. The commission's advisory came immediately after.

Earlier, the Election Commission had instructed candidates to open a separate bank account for elections. A majority of candidates had opened current accounts.

Last week, the commission had written to the central bank, asking that the weekly cash withdrawal limit, which was Rs. 24,000, be increased to Rs. 2 lakh for candidates up for election in the five states. The bank had pointed out that though the government allows candidates to spend above Rs. 20 lakh, given the withdrawal limits, they would be able to spend less than Rs. 1 lakh before the elections begin.

The expenditure limits are capped at Rs. 28 lakh for Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and Rs. 20 lakh for Manipur and Goa.

The central bank, however, turned down the Commission, saying a special provision was not possible at the moment. The Commission had hit back, saying the RBI apparently ""has not realised the gravity of the situation"". ""It is reiterated that it is the constitutional mandate of the commission to conduct free and fair elections and to provide level playing field to all candidates,"" the Commission said, insisting that its directions be complied with.

In order to facilitate proper conduct of elections, it is imperative that directions issued by the commission are complied with,"" the poll authority said in a fresh letter to RBI chief Urjit Patel expressing ""serious concern"" over the bank's response.

The commission had on Wednesday requested the RBI to enhance the withdrawal limit for candidates from 24,000 to 2 lakhs rupees per week to help them meet their campaign expenditure. The weekly cash withdrawal limit set after the Nov 8 notes ban - which preceded a massive cash crunch across the country - has not been increased.

Assembly elections in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - begin from February 4. The poll panel wants the facility to be provided till results are announced on March 11.

The commission said the returning officer of the constituency would issue certificate of a person's candidacy which would allow him/her to withdraw the extra cash from bank accounts opened especially to meet poll expenses, which the commission said it monitors.

The poll panel has now asked the central bank to reconsider the request.

It reminded the central bank that as per law, candidates contesting assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab can spend Rs. 28 lakh each for electioneering. The limit in Goa and Manipur is Rs. 20 lakh each.

The poll panel argued that despite paying amounts through cheques, candidates still need hard cash for petty expenses, especially in rural areas where banking facilities are limited.

It sought to ease pain of notes ban, gave tax breaks to the middle class
Also reached out to farmers, poor with special schemesFinance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Union Budget 2017 pledged to hike government spending on the rural poor and cut taxes on Wednesday, seeking to ease the pain of the notes ban in what he called it a ""budget for the poor"". He promised to double the income of farmers in the next five years and also to bring 10 million households out of poverty by 2019, seeking to reassure people that the slowdown of the economy caused by demonetisation would not spill over to the next year.

The Finance Minister promised more affordable housing for the poor, halved the basic rate of income tax to 5 per cent and cut taxes on small firms which make up 96 per cent of India's businesses, imposing an income-tax surcharge on those who earn more to offset the losses.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ban on 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, announced on November 8 with an aim to uproot corruption and black money, took out 86 per cent of the cash in circulation at the time. It resulted in a currency crunch that was seen to hit farmers, the rural poor and small traders the most.

'Accept money from any party but vote for BJP', said the minister
Delhi Chief Minister also triggered a row after making similar statement
                                Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has been asked by the Election Commission to explain by Friday his controversial remarks during campaigning for the upcoming elections in Goa in which he appeared to tell people that they could accept money from any political party but should vote for the BJP.

On Sunday, the minister had told a small crowd at Chimbel near Panaji: ""...I understand if someone organises a rally and you take Rs. 500 for moving around with (the candidate), that is not a problem. But when you vote, choose the lotus (BJP's poll symbol). This you must remember.""

The Election Commission had ordered the police to file a First Information Report or FIR against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party, after he stoked row with a similar statement.

At a rally in Goa's Benaulim earlier this month, Mr Kejriwal had said: ""If Congress or BJP candidates offer money, do not refuse it. Accept it as your own money. But when it comes to voting, press the button against the name of the AAP candidate.""

But in an apparent correction on Monday, Mr Parrikar said, ""I want to say this to you: please do not fall for any greed. Voting is a pure deed... The government is for the next generation. So, while electing a government, you have to decide what the coming government will give us.""

Regional party Goa Forward however registered a complaint with the Election Commission, saying that if action is being taken against Mr Kejriwal for similar comments, the Defence Minister should not be spared.

In several tweets, the Delhi Chief Minister also dared the Election Commission to take action against Mr Parrikar. On Tuesday, he also posted a video of the minister's comments.

""Will EC dare take action against Manohar Parrikar?"" Mr Kejriwal said in tweets, adding, ""I urge PMO to allow EC to act against Parrikar.""

The Congress also demanded action against Mr Parrikar.

With less than 20 days to go for the assembly elections in the crucial, Congress-ruled hill-state, the BJP is seen as upping its game with the new list of campaigners - which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah and a series of Union ministers including Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Manohar Parrikar, Nitin Gadkari, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Uma Bharti and Smriti Irani.

The list -- submitted by the party national general secretary Arun Singh to the Election Commission on January 24 -- also features 15 prominent BJP leaders from Uttarakhand, including former chief ministers BC Khanduri, Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank.

It also has three former Congress rebels who joined the BJP over the last few months - former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna and former cabinet ministers Yashpal Arya and Harak Singh Rawat. Mr Arya and Mr Rawat are also the BJP's electoral candidates from Bajpur and Kotdwar constituencies.

The party is also deploying Bollywood actor and lawmaker Hema Malini and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.

He did a complete u-turn today, saying his statements have been ""misconstrued"".

The temple issue, the 47-year-old leader told NDTV, is ""a personal matter of faith"" for him, but not an issue in this time's assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, which will vote in seven phases beginning next week.

The Election Commission has, citing a recent Supreme Court order, warned political parties to desist from seeking votes in the name of religion.

The ""main issue in the election is of lawlessness, murders, rapes, loots and caste based politics"" Mr Maurya said today, adding that if the BJP comes to power, ""goons will rot in jail.""

Keshav Prasad Maurya, who took over as the BJP's UP president in April last year, has an RSS or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh background. He was also a member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad or VHP, which led has led the demand for a Ram temple in Ayodhya. The RSS is the ideological mentor of both the BJP and the VHP.

The BJP has for many years now not included the Ayodhya temple as an election issue.

Mr Maurya is an Other Backward Caste or OBC leader and his appointment as state chief last year was seen as part of the party's strategy to woo that the BC vote bank in the state.

The BJP, which had won only 47 seats in the 2012 assembly elections, hopes to extend its performance in the 2104 national election in UP to this year's assembly election. The party had swept the state then winning 71 of UP's 80 seats.

The request of the Election Commission comes ahead of the assembly elections in five states, which begin on February 8. According to the last rule of the Central Bank, one can withdraw Rs. 24,000 a week from banks. But no special provision has been made for the candidates contesting the assembly elections.

In its letter to the Reserve Bank, the Commission said it has been ""apprised of the problems"" the candidates are facing. The government, it said, has fixed a limit of expenditure, which is 28 lakh for Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and Rs. 20 lakh for Manipur and Goa. But given the cap of Rs. 24,000 on withdrawal per week, the candidates can withdraw only Rs. 96,000 over the three to four weeks left, the Commission pointed pointed out.

""Even considering that part of the expenditure will be incurred through cheque, petty and recurring expenditure is generally incurred in cash,"" the letter read. ""The issue is further compounded in rural areas, where banking facilities are not available or are negligible.""

The ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which came within a few hours of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise announcement on November 8, has been followed by a huge cash crunch as nearly 86 per cent of currency suddenly went out of circulation. The Reserve Bank imposed withdrawal limits from banks and ATMs. While the situation has eased as the new notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 2000 trickled into circulation, the RBI is relaxing the cash withdrawal rules in phrases.

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the central bank will remove restrictions on cash withdrawals only after assessing market situation and the government will not interfere in the process.

BJP's senior leader in Uttar Pradesh Surya Pratap Shahi has been fielded from Pathardeva constituency in Deoria district.

With the third list of 67 candidates, the saffron party has so far announced a total of 371 candidates out of 403. Now, 32 seats are left, some of which will go to BJP's alliance partners Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).

BJP National Secretary Arun Singh, who announced the list, said the party has tried to give representation to every section of people in its list.

On being asked why there is not even a single Muslim candidate in BJP's list, Mr Singh said the party would field one as soon as it finds a ""suitable candidate"".

""We will give ticket to Muslims whenever we find a suitable candidate,"" he said.

To a question of many ""star-kids"" in the BJP list though the party openly criticises nepotism, Arun Singh said there is nothing wrong if a family member of a leader gets ticket on the basis of their work.

                                No specific schemes can be announced in the union budget for the five states where assembly elections are due this year, the Election Commission has said. The Commission said, ""in the interest of free and fair elections"" and to maintain ""level playing field during elections"", no state specific schemes should be announced in the national budget, which may influence the voters in the five poll-bound states ""in favour of the ruling party"".

The Commission also said it should be ensured that in the Budget speech, ""the government's achievements in respect of the five states will also not be highlighted in any manner"".

The top election body's comments came after opposition parties complained to poll panel and wanted the budget to be postponed.

""We hope and we clearly say that it is the responsibility of the Election Commission and they must abide by their constitutional duty to ensure that polls are free and fair, that no kind of inducements which will impress upon the voter in the election in the five states would happen,"" news agency Press Trust of India had quoted Congress spokesperson Ajoy Kumar as saying.

Earlier on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the budget will be held on February 1. The order came in response to a petition that sought the budget be pushed back in view of the assembly elections in five states, so it would not influence the voters.

The court, however, said the union budget has ""nothing to do with states"". ""Throughout the year, there may be elections in different states, so should the centre not present the budget?"" the judges questioned.

Last year, the centre had announced that it would present the budget earlier than usual so it does not clash with the election schedule. Ending a practice that had started in the British era, the government also said the railway budget would be merged with the annual budget.

""Strictly follow the Supreme Court verdict, which said seeking votes in the name of religion, caste is a corrupt practice,"" the powerful election body said in a letter to all parties, directing them to ""instruct cadre to desist from soliciting votes in the name of religion and caste.""

The letter quotes extracts of the top court judgment.

In a separate letter to chief electoral officers of all states, the Commission said any activity of seeking votes in the name of religion and caste by or on behalf of any candidate or political party would now amount to violation of the provisions of the Mode Code of Conduct. The CEOs have been asked to inform the grassroots level election officials and ensure the compliance of the Supreme Court orders during elections.

Earlier this month, in a majority verdict, the Supreme Court held that appeal for votes on the ground of ""religion, race, caste, community or language"" amounted to ""corrupt practice"".

Referring to that order, the Election Commission said all parties should take note of it for ""strict compliance"".

""The political parties may also suitably brief and inform their lower formations and party cadres and all their candidates about the ruling of the Supreme Court and ask them to desist from any activities that would amount to soliciting votes in the name of religion, caste, etc in any manner, in their own interest and in the interest of the party. Such appeals may also fall within the ambit of... Model Code of Conduct,"" the letter to top bosses of all recognised national and state political parties said.

Mulayam Singh in meetings with Akhilesh Yadav had sought seats for 38
Akhilesh's list includes Shivpal, leaves out Mulayam's other close aides
                                Estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav has made Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's first list of 191 Samajwadi Party candidates, but several other close associates of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav have been left out. The candidates were announced today ahead of a formal announcement of the party's alliance for the Uttar Pradesh election with the Congress. The ruling party's first list of candidates covers the first three phases of the UP elections, which will be held in seven phases beginning February 11. The Samajwadi Party has said it will contest 300 of UP's 403 seats, with the balance being allotted to the Congress.

Akhilesh Yadav's list corrects an earlier list of candidates that his father Mulayam Singh Yadav had released last month, which left out several of the chief minister's key aides. Those associates like Atul Pradhan and Arvind Singh Gope are being fielded by the party now.

Senior minister Azam Khan, who played mediator between father and son in their bitter power struggle in the last few weeks, will contest again from his constituency Rampur. His son Abdullah Azam makes his debut as a Samajwadi Party candidate from Swaar. Both had also featured in Mulayam Singh's list of candidates.

But Shivpal Yadav's son Aditya has not been given a ticket by cousin Akhilesh Yadav. Mulyam Singh loyalists like current lawmakers Raghuraj Shakhya and Sukh Devi Verma have been dropped.

Today's list also leaves out candidates like Atiq Ahmed, a gangster-turned-politician with multiple criminal cases against him. He had earlier been announced as a Samajwadi Party candidate by Mulayam Singh at the behest of Shivpal Yadav, even though Akhilesh Yadav had strongly opposed fielding him.

Shivpal Yadav, who will contest Jaswantnagar, the constituency he represents, is in many ways the crux of the feud between the Chief Minister and his father Mulayam Singh. In the months before the crucial UP elections, Shivpal Yadav had challenged the Chief Minister on key decisions and was consistently backed by Mulayam Singh.

Last month, Akhilesh Yadav had announced his own candidates in defiance of his father's list and was later declared Samajwadi Party president by his supporters in place of his father at a party meeting. ","new delhi:"

They didn't come in peace. Loud slogan-shouting erupted within seconds. Despite Mr Shah's warning to party men not to lobby for or protest against candidates for next month's state elections, the BJP is facing minor mutinies several times a day.

Today's first group of protesters was from Dhaulana town in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP has named Ramesh Chandra Tomar as its candidate. YP Singh was the party's choice in the previous polls. His supporters loudly and relentlessly tried to seize Mr Shah's attention. They are angry that Dharmesh Tomar, a turn-coat, has been named BJP candidate. Mr Tomar won the seat in the previous 2012 state polls as a Samajwadi candidate, reducing the BJP's YP Singh to a poor third. The BJP is seen to be betting on caste equations by fielding Mr Tomar.

The second group of ""rebels"" was from Amroha, also in UP. The protesters shouted slogans for Devendra Nagpal, who says he has been denied a chance in the Naugavan constituency.

The BJP has chosen ex-cricketer Chetan Chauhan, who represented the Amroha parliamentary seat long ago but is now being dubbed an ""outsider"" by Mr Nagpal's loyalists.

Tarsem Singh, a BJP worker holding a protest placard, said, ""The local BJP's views have not been considered. Mr Chauhan has no chance of winning as he has not been in Amroha since his term as MP ended. ''

The protestor alleges that the party has set up a walkover for the Samajwadi Party's Mehboob, a four-term MP, by choosing Mr Chauhan.

The shouting bunch finally got a hearing with the BJP's points person for the Uttar Pradesh polls, senior leader Om Mathur.

In the last three days, at least 10 groups have challenged the choices made by the party's central election committee headed by Amit Shah, which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The incessant protests reflect that the party's effort to add leaders from rival parties is backfiring and also threatens to upset caste calculations.

Yesterday, another group of protestors from UP were assured that the party will not field a turncoat from Noida, like in the case of Dadri and Jewar.

In Dadri, the BJP is fielding Tejpal Nagar, 58, and in Jewar, 50-year-old Dhirendra Singh is the candidate. They are both recent recruits, taken not before 2014.

Due to the unrest in these two seats, the party has delayed naming a candidate in Noida.","new delhi:"

Congress seeks 110 seats, rejects final offer by Akhilesh, say sources
Congress was voted out of power in UP by Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989
                                The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance which was promising to alter the political equations for Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh is in trouble. Hectic negotiations for the last few days hit a wall on Friday when both sides, off the record, called the other's demand for more seats unreasonable. Amidst building tension, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav started talks with Congress leaders through back channels to iron out the differences since Saturday morning.

At the heart of the trouble were two key issues - how many seats will each get and which seat will go to which party.

By evening the talks were stalled once again. Akhilesh Yadav, who started bargaining from not more than 85 seats in the morning made the final offer by late afternoon. He has now put them all in the Congress's court by agreeing to give 99 of the 403 seats to the Congress. But the Congress wants nothing less than 104 - it had asked for 110.

The two parties had sent out all the right signals till Monday last. But when the two camps sat down for seat sharing talks trouble erupted. Senior Samajwadi Party leaders today indicated that Akhilesh Yadav who has already announced 210 candidates - some even on seats held by Congress legislators - may announce few more if talks fail as time is running out and nominations for the first phase are ending on January 24.

The chief minister is not waiting for the alliance to be through in more ways. Tomorrow, Akhilesh Yadav will be releasing his party's manifesto in Lucknow.

Sensing tie-up trouble, top Congress leaders had rushed to Lucknow. The Congress which has been reduced to player number four in Uttar Pradesh was eyeing the alliance to recover ground. While senior Samajwadi Party leaders maintain that the Congress doesn't have the footprint strength to initially demand nearly 130 seats, the Congress says anything less will hurt the national party's interests.

Samajwadi Party sources say the alliance is not taking off as the Congress wants it to surrender some seats it had won in 2012.

However, insiders say that the real tussle is over seats where minority vote holds sway. The Congress was edged out of power in Uttar Pradesh by Akhilesh Yadav's father Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989. The rise of 'Mullah Mulayam' brought the drift of minority vote to the Samajwadi Party from the Congress. While the Samajwadi Party is keen to maintain its most favoured party status among Muslims, the Congress wants to regain lost ground via the alliance.","new delhi:"

Chief Minister Harish Rawat will also that the BJP-led Centre had dismissed the Congress-led state government till it was restored by the judiciary.

""Kishor is like Chyawanprash... People resort to such tonics as they age,"" MR Rawat was quoted, by PTI, as saying.

Many senior Congress leaders from the state, including former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, resigned from the party to join the BJP. However, the BJP's decision to field these ex-Congressmen from various constituencies has led to resentment among the senior BJP leaders from the state including Om Gopal Rawat, Asha Nautiyal and Shailendra Singh Rawat.

The party however withheld the announcement for six others, where it has sitting MLAs, indicating that some of them could be dropped. Union Minister J P Nadda, who is also party's Central Election Committee (CEC) Secretary, told reporters that the names of remaining candidates would be announced later. Five sitting MLAs are among the 17 candidates announced today. BJP has 12 MLAs in the outgoing Assembly.

These six seats include four being represented by ministers in the SAD-BJP coalition government. A couple of them could be dropped as they are over 75 years of age and some others are being seen more vulnerable in an election where the alliance is weathering 10 years of anti-incumbency.

It also fielded Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina for the bypoll to Amritsar Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant following the resignation of Congress leader Amarinder Singh, who had defeated Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2014 polls. Rajesh Hani will contest from Amritsar East, a seat held by Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who along with her husband Navjot Singh Sidhu has quit BJP. She has joined Congress.

The five MLAs in today's list are Dinesh Singh Babbu, Seema Kumari, Ashwani Sharma, K D Bhandari and Sukhjeet Kaur Sahi from Sujanpur, Bhoa, Pathankot, Jalandhar North and Dasuya constituencies respectively.

BJP's National Secretary Tarun Chugh will fight from Amritsar Central.

Some MLAs, who are likely to be dropped, are pitching for family members as party candidates.

The CEC, which included Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah, had met last evening to finalise the names. Sources said there are divergent views in the party over dropping some of the MLAs, causing a delay in the final announcement.

The notification for the state polls, to be held on February 4, was made yesterday and the last date of filing nomination is January 18.

In a strong letter, citing a recent judgement of the Supreme Court, the EC said peace and tranquility during the polls process is ""absolutely essential for free and peaceful conduct of elections in the country.""

""As you are kindly aware the model code of conduct and various provisions of IPC, inter alia, provide that political parties and their leaders should desist from making statements to the effect of creating disharmony between different sections of society on the basis of religion as the same disturb peace and tranquility of the society which is absolutely essential for free and peaceful conduct of elections.

""Even, the apex court of the country has expressed its deep concerns in the matter vide its judgement and order dated January 2, 2017...,"" it said.

The EC's letter to the national and state parties added: ""The Commission will not remain a silent spectator if the provisions of law or MCC are violated and no one can do it with impunity. The Commission will take stern actions for any violation under all powers available.""

""All may please note it and issue suitable advisory to all concerned,"" it added.

In a landmark verdict seeking to separate religion, caste and other issues from politics, the Supreme Court, by a majority verdict, had held as ""corrupt"" the practice of candidates appealing for votes on the basis of these identities included not only him but his agents and voters.

The court held that the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, which say that seeking vote by a candidate in the name of ""his"" religion, caste, race and language in the election law, included candidates, his agents and voters also.

""An appeal in the name of religion, race, caste, community or language is impermissible under the R P Act, 1951 and would constitute a corrupt practice sufficient to annul the election in which such an appeal was made regardless whether the appeal was in the name of the candidate's religion or the religion of the election agent or that of the opponent or that of the voter's,"" the top court order had said.

Election will be held in Punjab on February 4
Mr Sidhu had quit the BJP in September 2016
                                Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu joined the Congress today ahead of assembly elections in Punjab after yet another meeting with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, who welcomed him into the party. The 58-year-old had quit the BJP in September 2016, complaining that he had been sidelined.

Mr Sidhu came on board after lengthy negotiations and several rounds of meetings with Mr Gandhi. His wife Navjot Kaur said he would be contesting from the Amritsar East seat. Sources also said he would get one ticket per family for some of his supporters. As one of the party's star campaigner, he would also address more than 70 rallies.

It was, however, not clear that Mr Sidhu would be offered the post of the deputy Chief Minister, as he had earlier demanded.

Today' meeting with Rahul Gandhi -- the second in four days -- happened at mid-day, during which the Congress vice-president welcomed him into the party. Within minutes, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, ""INC welcomes S.Navjot Singh Sidhu & thanks Rahul Gandhiji for bringing likeminded leaders under the Congress umbrella"".

Later in the afternoon, Mr Sidhu tweeted:
Mr Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur has already been fielded as a candidate, but the constituency is yet to be decided.

Election will be held in Punjab on February 4, in which the Congress, which has been out of power for a decade, has been hoping for big gains. Captain Singh, who is leading the Congress campaign in the state and denied rumours about being unenthusiastic about having Mr Sidhu on board, today said he had spoken to the former cricketer on phone.","new delhi:"

Mr Parsekar figures in the list released by the party in New Delhi today following its Central Election Committee's meeting last evening.

One sitting MLA, Deputy Speaker Vishnu Surya Wagh, who had last year suffered cardiac arrest, has not been fielded on health grounds and is replaced by Ramrao Surya Wagh.

Defence Minister and former Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar will be the key election campaigner for the party in a state where Congress, an alliance of regional outfits, including one headed by a former senior RSS leader, and AAP are other players in the fray.

Mr Parsekar, a Parrikar loyalist, had taken over from him after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted him in his Cabinet as Defence Minister. He, however, continues to have a say in the state's affairs.

Releasing the list, J P Nadda, who is CEC secretary, said the party has given representation to all communities and added that it is considering putting up candidates for all the 40 seats.

The last date of filing nomination, which began yesterday, is January 18.

Asked about its chief ministerial candidate, he said any decision in this regard will be taken by the Parliamentary Board.

Most of the candidates announced today will contest the polls in the first two phases on February 11 and 15. The party's Central Election Committee met last night to finalise the candidates. It will meet again, tomorrow, to discuss other prospective candidates for the polls.

Among the candidates released by the party, former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Vajpayee will seek to retain the Meerut constituency whereas Sandeep Singh, grandson of former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, will contest the poll in Atrauli.

The Congress released the first part of its manifesto - there are three parts - for Delhi today targeting the urban poor who live in massive slums and unauthorised colonies across the capital and who gave Mr Kejriwal 60 per cent of his vote share two years ago.

""The upcoming Delhi civic body polls will be a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP. There is no third party in the contest,"" said Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken as he released the manifesto, calling Delhi's urban poor the most neglected segment in the capital. The Congress has promised that if it wins the three municipal corporations in Delhi, it will set aside 2,000 crores for the re-settlement of those who live in unauthorised colonies.

The party has also promised that Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD sanitation employees, currently on contract, will be given permanent jobs. And those 5 lakh street vendors will be given licences. The party also plans a scheme to bring drop-outs from MCD-run schools back into the education system.

In an important promise, the Congress has taken up complete elimination of land fill sites for better sanitation. The next two tranches of promises will focus on infrastructure and the youth.

The Congress has released its manifesto a day after the BJP did. The Aam Aadmi Party plans to release its manifesto tomorrow.

Elections to the MCD, now split into three - MCD North, MCD South and MCD East - will be held on Sunday, April 23, and votes will be counted on Wednesday, April 26. Delhi's civic body has been dominated by the BJP for 10 years now. In 2012, the first election after the MCD was divided into three, the BJP won a majority in the north and east and was the largest party in MCD south. The Congress had trailed in second place in all three. The Aam Aadmi Party did not contest that election - it was launched later that year.

While the BJP has pulled out all stops to retain control with a keenly devised strategy and high powered campaign, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP is seen as fighting to retain political relevance after being trounced in the Punjab and Goa elections this year.

The Congress' recent record in Delhi hasn't been great. In the assembly elections two years ago, AAP swept it aside winning 67 of 70 seats. The BJP won the other three. In the national election in 2014, the BJP took all seven Delhi seats in a Modi wave.","new delhi:"

The ruling party of Delhi, which made its debut in the civic elections two years after its massive sweep in Assembly polls, came a poor second.

As the trends made the extent of its losses clear, Chief Minister Kejriwal's deputy Manish Sisodia said, ""EVM tampering is the bitter truth of the country's democracy. One can crack jokes on us initially, but fearing being made fun of, we cannot refrain from speaking the truth"".

Following a huddle Mr Kejriwal's residence, the party blamed the loss on what it called an ""EVM wave"" -- an allegation levelled by some parties in the aftermath of the recent round of assembly elections. Delhi minister and senior party leader Gopal Rai said, ""This isn't a Modi wave, this is an EVM wave. The same happened in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand"".

A number of BJP leaders reacted with derision. ""If they stay in the same mode (of blaming EVMs) no one can save them,"" said Vijay Goel. ""If there was EVM tampering, it would have happened in Punjab too,"" pointed out Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.

Party chief Amit Shah weighed in, saying Mr Kejriwal won the 2015 assembly elections on the same EVMs. The UPA 1 and UPA 2 also came to power on those very machines. ""If EVMs are faulty, how did they manage to win? I think everyone should respectfully accept the electorate's decision,"" he said.

But AAP refused to back down. ""I want to ask GVL (Narasimha Rao) why he has written a book on EVMs and said we should adopt ballot boxes,"" retorted party leader Ashutosh. Earlier today, BJP spokesperson Mr Rao had coined a new definition of AAP, tweeting it was ""Absolute Arrogance Personified"".

""While one expected political opponents to distort facts to drive political mileage, it is a matter of grave concern that a responsible government agency is behaving in such a manner and spreading a canard against me,"" he claimed in a statement.

Mr Singh's reaction came in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attaching a farmhouse in New Delhi having a market value of Rs. 27 crore.

The agency alleged the property in the upmarket south Delhi area of Dera Mandi near Mehrauli was purchased ""out of laundered money through shell firms"".

It indicated that the funds were paid as quid pro quo by the director of a Delhi-based firm for establishing a hydro power plant in Himachal Pradesh's Chamba district.

 Mr Singh said that the Centre had been using its full might to harass and destablise a duly elected government in Himachal Pradesh and ""the ED and CBI were being misused to probe bogus charges against him, even though nothing incriminating had been found so far.""

He also accused the Deputy Director of Income Tax, Faridabad for creating ""baseless and fictitious survey reports and dossiers under instructions from the IT department, Chandigarh.""

""The farmland in question was purchased for only Rs. 1.20 crore by the company Ms Mapple, promoted by my son Vikrmaditya,"" the Congress leader said, adding that he gave Rs. 90 lakh to his son from his personal account through proper banking channels, and the remaining amount was paid from his personal accrued money.

""My family took friendly loans amounting to Rs. 5.90 crore from V Chandersekhar and the amount had been paid back in full with interest long time back and accounted for tax appropriately. It is on record that the said property was purchased for Rs. 1.20 crore, but the ED gave its value at Rs. 27 crore,"" the statement said.

The Chief Minister also alleged that an officer, whose wife is a BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh, was assigned the duty of assessing Maple as Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi. He said that the officer instead of assessing the revenue, made ""malafide conclusions that the property was worth Rs. 27 crore.""

""Now the ED was using the baseless revenue assessment figure of Rs. 27 crore to sensatonalise the matter to malign and defame him,"" he further alleged.

""All this was a matter of record yet my family members have been harassed and persecuted using multiple central agencies since 2013,"" he said.

The 'M3'-type EVMs are also equipped with a self-diagnostic system for authentication of genuineness of the machines.

These will come with a public key interface-based mutual authentication system.

Only a ""genuine"" EVM -- manufactured either by atomic energy PSU ECIL or defence PSU BEL -- ""communicates"" with other EVMs in the field.

Any EVM manufactured by other companies would not be able to communicate with other machines, thus exposing it.

Around Rs. 1,940 crore (excluding freight and taxes) will be required to procure the new machines which are likely to be introduced by 2018, a year before when the next Lok Sabha elections are due, the Law Ministry has said, quoting details made available by the Election Commission to be given to Parliament.

The Election Commission has decided to replace 9,30,430 EVMs purchased before 2006 as the older machines are nearing their 15-year life cycle, he said.

On December 7 last, the Union Cabinet had approved a fresh tranche of Rs. 1,009 crore for the Election Commission to buy new EVMs so that it can phase out the ageing ones before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Cabinet had also authorised the Election Commission to vary the quantity to be ordered on BEL and ECIL based on their production capacity and past performance.

On July 20 last, a similar Election Commission proposal to buy nearly 14 lakh new EVMs -- the first tranche -- at a cost of Rs. 9,200 crore during 2016-17 was approved by the Union Cabinet.

"276","We Are Capable On Our Own: Mulayam Singh Dismisses Son Akhilesh Yadav's Alliance Talk","                             The friction between Mulayam Singh and his son Akhilesh -- buried in the aftermath of the Samajwadi Party's drubbing in the recent assembly elections - has come to the fore again over the suggestion of yet another alliance. On Sunday, the party veteran dismissed the suggestion that arch rival and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati and his party can work together. ""We are capable on our own,"" was the terse response from the Yadav Senior when asked to comment on talks of a grand alliance against the BJP for 2019.

In the process, he contradicted what his son Akhilesh Yadav said barely 24 hours ago.

""There should be a grand alliance. We are in favour of it,"" Mulayam's son and the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had said on Saturday, barely 24 hours after Mayawati said her Bahujan Samaj Patry was ready to work with like-minded parties ""to save democracy"".

The BSP, she said, had no reservations in taking the help of anti-BJP parties in its fight against EVM tampering and the BJP. ""It is democracy which comes first... we have to keep democracy alive,"" she told her party workers in Lucknow on Friday.

The Congress -- which partnered the Samajwadi Party ahead of the elections and had been the cause of another flashpoint in the Yadav family -- offered to mediate. ""Congress would act as a bridge for SP and BSP,"" senior party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar said. ""We have two years before the elections, we can make this alliance a great alliance,"" he said.

A grand alliance had succeeded in Bihar but will it work nationally?

The Left Front said there is a need to make common cause over people's issues. ""There is a possibility of stopping the BJP. And to stop them, there is need for the broadest possible people's action for which all should come together,"" asserted CPI leader D Raja, who, in recent times, has met Akhilesh Yadav, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

Mr Raja admits that in many states ""potential national allies"" are bitter rivals in state. ""There are difficulties in certain states like West Bengal or Tripura. But each party will have to do their own assessment and our assessments may even converge,"" Mr Raja told NDTV. In Bengal and Tripura, the Left is bitterly opposed to Trinamool while in Kerala, Congress is the Left's main electoral rival.

The BJP calls the idea of a grand alliance a non-starter. ""Whether Akhilesh forms alliance or a grand alliance, he won't be able to stop the BJP. People of the nation are with Prime Minister Modi and they want development,"" said Keshav Prasad Maurya, the deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.","new delhi:"

The Prime Minister holds these meetings on the third Wednesday of every month, but could not do so for the last two months because of hectic campaigning that leaders were involved in for the assembly elections in five states.

The Modi government finishes three years next month and ministers are expected to be asked today to list achievements in their departments. A few of them could also make presentations, sources said.

Cabinet ministers have already been asked to list five achievements each in their ministries that have benefited people, including key reforms. They have also been asked to provide data that shows the progress made since the BJP-led government came to power.

Last week, Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu sent a letter to all the ministers explaining that these inputs would be included in a booklet that the government plans to publish before May 26, the day PM Modi took oath three years ago.

The ministers have been asked to make three-page submissions that must be in bullet points only and must list the key performance indicators or KPIs of the department.

Some ministers have been asked to prepare notes on specific sectors. Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar has been asked to write one on the highlights of PM's tours abroad and on increased investment flow from foreign countries.

Earlier this week, the Prime Minister also met over dinner, leaders of 32 parties that are the BJP's allies in the National Democratic Alliance or NDA that it leads over dinner. The allies endorsed the centre's policies and vowed to work together to win a second term under PM Modi's leadership in 2019, union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after the meeting.","new delhi:"

He will spend 95 days, as announced by him in the recent national executive in Bhubaneswar, during the drive, which starts from Jammu and Kashmir. He will spend two to three days in each of the states and union territories.

This programme is different from his 15-day tour of five states, which started today with a three-day stay in West Bengal, as the BJP aims at toning up the organisational structure and will not involve much public contact.

""This is for the first time that the president of a party as big as the BJP will be touring all states of the country to strengthen the organisation. We want to make the birth centenary year of Deen Dayal Upadhyay a memorable period in our history,"" party general secretary Arun Singh said.

Deen Dayal Upadhyay is one of the two ideological stalwarts, the other being Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. It has launched a series of nation-wide activities from September 25, 1916 to observe his birth centenary year.

The entire exercise underlines Mr Shah's ambitious plans to increase the party's footprints across the country, especially in electorally important states where it has always been a
fringe player, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

He is especially focusing on Odisha, West Bengal, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and Telangana, which together send 141 MPs to the Lok Sabha of 543 members, excluding two

"282","Arvind Kejriwal: As IIT Engineer, Can Share 10 Ways To Rig EVMs"," HighlightsArvind Kejriwal's AAP placed third in Delhi by-election
Delhi's local elections coming up later this month
This result not an indicator of how AAP will perform in those, he says
                                Despite bombing in a by-election in Delhi this week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today told NDTV that the people of Delhi are happy with his government. Mr Kejriwal insisted that his Aam Aadmi Party or AAP had foreseen its loss in the election for an assembly seat, but was ""unable to share its message effectively.""

Yesterday, AAP was such a poor third in the by-election that its candidate lost his deposit. The BJP won the seat, the Congress was runner-up. AAP's result was used by both parties to predict a crash-and-burn outcome for Mr Kejriwal in the municipal elections in the capital scheduled for the 23rd. ""This is not a trailer,"" said Mr Kejriwal, referring to the by-election and claiming that AAP was punished because people were upset that the legislator in the constituency that voted, Rajouri Garden, had been moved to contest the recent election in Punjab.

The local elections on the 23rd will measure his popularity mid-way through his term. In 2015, AAP, a political novice, pulled off a win of startling proportion, losing just three seats in Delhi. Of late, the party has been bruised by its inability to win Punjab, where Mr Kejriwal led an extensive campaign, and by a series of indictments for allegedly going rogue on basic guidelines and processes required of the government. Mr Kejriwal has pointed out that the verdicts against him have been delivered by committees created by the centre, which he has long accused of plotting to destabilize him.

In recent days, AAP has been ordered to reimburse the Delhi government 97 crores - the amount spent on ads that allegedly promoted Mr Kejriwal and his party in violation of Supreme Court rules. It has been asked to return a bungalow that it was assigned as a party office. The government has been asked to explain why it tried to pay a 3-crore bill for Ram Jethamalani, one of the country's most famous lawyers, hired to represent Mr Kejriwal in a defamation case filed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. ""I am fighting this case as Chief Minister...the government has every right to hire the best lawyer,"" he said today, when asked why government lawyers were not tasked with his case.

Through these scandals, Mr Kejriwal has kept up a campaign attacking the Election Commission for allowing voting machines to be rigged in Punjab, the only explanation, he says, for his defeat there. ""The Commission is pulling out all stops to help the BJP win,"" he repeated today. ""I am an engineer from IIT... I can tell you 10 ways in which EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) can be tampered,"" he said, challenging the Commission which has said that voting machines cannot be gamed, a premise it hopes to prove through a 10-day open-to-the-public hackathon next month in Delhi.","new delhi:"

"286","MCD Election 2017: Voting Begins For Delhi Civic Polls","                             Voting for Delhi Civic Polls began this morning for the 272 wards in which the ruling BJP is locked in a triangular battle with the Congress and the AAP. More than 1.3 crore people are eligible to vote in the Delhi civic elections, spread over 13,000 polling stations across the national capital. Both the BJP and the Congress have exuded confidence about winning the electoral battle while the AAP is seeking to replicate its 2015 Assembly elections performance, despite suffering a debacle in the Rajouri Garden bypoll.

Polling began at 8 am amid tight security arrangements across the city.

Out of the 13,022 polling stations, the police have declared 3,284 as sensitive and 1,464 as hyper-sensitive.

Over 1.1 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise for the first time. Also, for the first time in MCD elections, None Of The Above (NOTA) option has been made available.

There are a total of 1,32,10,206 voters entitled to exercise their franchise in electing councillors for the wards falling under the three corporations - NDMC (104), SDMC (104) and EDMC (64).

Voting will be held till 5 pm. Counting of votes will be held on April 26.

The Delhi State Election Commission has deployed ample staff to man its polling stations, some of which fall in outer Delhi areas.

The wards going to polls include Narela, Okhla, Rajouri Garden, Ballimaran, Nawada, Vikas Nagar, Matiala, Munirka, Bhati, Tehkhand, Khichripur, Jhilmil, Wazirpur, Burari, Tilak Nagar, Kasturba Nagar and Andrews Ganj.

The verdict of the poll will have political ramifications beyond the capital's borders and reshape the political equations.

The BJP is seeking to retain the turf which it has held for the last 10 years and fielded all fresh faces from 267 wards. The party has projected for itself a tally of over 200 out of the 272 seats.

The AAP and the Congress too have claimed that they will cross the 200-mark.

The AAP has fielded candidates on all 272 wards while the Congress has 271 candidates in the fray.

Incidentally, in May last year, bypolls to 13 wards were held, in which the AAP had finished on top with five seats, followed by the Congress with 4, BJP at 3. One seat had gone to an independent candidate.

The AAP which had bagged 67 out of 70 seats in 2015 Delhi polls suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent Rajouri Garden bypoll.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, however, has refused to acknowledge the result as a ""trailer for MCD polls"".

His party has been highlighting ""corruption"" in the BJP-led civic bodies, an issue it seeks to leverage in this contest.

The erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated in 2012 into North, South and East Municipal Corporations.

There are 1,004 candidates vying in the NDMC area, 985 in SDMC and 548 in EDMC.

The BSP and the JD(U) have fielded 211 and 95 candidates respectively while the SP has entered the fray with 28.

The Generation-1 electronic voting machines (EVMs) are being used for the polls, which the Commission has described as ""foolproof"".

This would be the first civic poll after the latest delimitation which has redrawn the civic wards.

As per the new delimitation exercise, based on the 2011 Census, each ward now has an average of 60,000 people with an estimated 40,000 voters.

Delhi has 70 Assembly seats and before the delimitation, every constituency had four wards, but, now it ranges from 3-7.

His demand comes in the wake of the poll panel throwing an open challenge to hack its EVMs following a chorus by Opposition parties on alleged tampering of the machines in the recent state Assembly elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh where BJP staged a stunning victory.

Mr Singh said the Election Commission, instead of limiting its objections to EVM hacking, should also allow examination of its software at the stage of writing it from the server.

""EC limiting objections to EVMs. It must allow examination of possibility of software tampering at stage of writing it from server. There is a strong possibility of tampering coding at the stage of writing software i.e. EVMs can be pre-tampered. So no need for hacking...

""EC must devise a way of supervision by political parties of the coding software of EVMs, like it does at subsequent stages. Would they agree?"" the Congress leader tweeted.

The Election Commission had announced that from first week of May, experts, scientists and technocrats can try for a week or 10 days to hack the electronic voting machines.

Several opposition parties have demanded that voting in India should return to the old ballot papers system. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, asked the Election Commission and the Centre to explain the delay in switching to upgraded machines that provide a paper receipt (VVAPT), showing the ballot of each voter.","new delhi:"

It would also indicate if the high-pitch campaign by the BJP and the Congress, which were decimated in the state elections two years earlier, had been able to dent AAP's support base. The results for the by-elections will be declared on April 13, ten days before the capital votes for the three civic bodies.

Since 1993, Rajouri Garden had been electing a Congress candidate with the exception of the last two elections when it voted the BJP-Akali Dal combine candidate in 2013, and in 2015, when it gave the AAP a chance. Quite like the rest of Delhi.

AAP legislator Jarnail Singh had quit the seat after the party decided to field him in this week's Punjab assembly elections against the Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal, necessitating the by-elections. Singh lost, but he isn't coming back to Delhi.

The party has come up with a new face - Harjeet Singh - for the election. The BJP-SAD combine has fielded veteran Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who had won the seat in 2013 but lost out by about 10,000 votes in 2015. He received about 44,000 votes.

The Congress, which ruled the city for 15 years at a stretch, is leaving no stone unturned to pull off a victory and register its presence in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

The seat fell vacant early this year after AAP's Jarnail Singh quit as MLA to contest Punjab Assembly poll against SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal, only to lose and considerably dent AAP's chances of holding on to the seat.

While Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal addressed one rally in the area, the Congress brought in newly elected Punjab CM Amarinder Singh to address the voters in constituency dominated by the Punjabi community. The two had several feuds in the run up to the Punjab polls where Amarinder, a Congress giant, trounced the Kejriwal-led AAP and relegated the BJP-SAD to the third position.

Yesterday, MPs from Uttar Pradesh were hosted by the Prime Minister to celebrate the party's tremendous win in the politically-strategic state. They were also cautioned against seeking favours from the new Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath. Mr Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah said Yogi Adityanath must be allowed to focus on turning around the law and order problems in UP, and that phoning him to influence the transfer of officials or to seek appointments for friends and family is strictly off-limits.

After the BJP's blazing victory in Uttar Pradesh, there have been reports that the government will seek to advance the election in Gujarat to benefit from the famous ""Modi Wave."" Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told NDTV last week that the party in Gujarat will be ""ready for early elections, if needed.""

The BJP rode a Modi super-wave to a massive victory in Uttar Pradesh earlier this month, winning 312 of the state's 403 seats. The BJP also swept neighbouring Uttarakhand and formed governments in Goa and Manipur, with no party getting a majority. The only setback the BJP saw was in Punjab, where the Congress won.

The elections in the five states had turned into a virtual referendum on PM Modi's popularity following his decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.

This is the second time Mr Trump has called PM Modi ever since his inauguration as President of the United States.

India and the United States will ""stand shoulder to shoulder"" to fight global terrorism, the White House had said after that interaction.

The significance of US' partnership with India was reflected in the fact that President Trump called Prime Minister Modi before he spoke with important allies like Britain, Germany and Japan or major powers like China and Russia since formally taking office.

During that call, President Trump had emphasised that the United States ""considers India a true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world,"" according to a White House readout of the call.

The BJP, having dominated the Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD for years, is taking no chances; it has been challenged this time by Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which has focused all its attention on winning the civic election after faring poorly in assembly elections in Punjab and Goa.

Apart from Yogi Adityanath, who took oath last week as UP chief minister, four other BJP chief ministers and 14 central ministers feature in the BJP's list of star campaigners for the Delhi civic poll. The party's core team for the election has four union ministers - Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh, Sanjeev Balyan and Vijay Goel.

To stave off any anti-incumbency sentiment, the BJP has said it will field new faces for all the 272 seats in the civic bodies - North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporations, together the MCD. No sitting councillors or their family members will be fielded, the party has decided. On Monday, party chief Amit Shah held two separate meetings with union ministers, members of Parliament and the party's Delhi leaders to discuss strategy.

The Aam Aadmi Party, having failed to spread its influence it other states, is now attempting to extend its success in the Delhi assembly elections, two years ago, to the ward-level in the capital.

Demanding apology from the BJP, Mr Singh said, ""Shame on you Mr Parrikar and your hunger for power. You have cheated the People of Goa. Apologise to them.""

Digvijaya Singh also alleged that the Goa Governor Mridula Sinha ""robbed the mandate of people"".

Mr Parrikar, who resigned as the country's Defence Minister to return to his home state earlier this month, visited the Rajya Sabha on Friday during Zero Hour to thank the members of the House.

"312","'Why Should I Resign? I Delivered,' Digvijaya Singh After Sabotage Charge"," HighlightsDigvijaya criticised for Congress failing to form Goa government
Take responsibility but I think have done the right thing: Digvijaya
BJP formed Goa government despite winning fewer seats than Congress
                                After a strong rebuttal to his critics within the party, Congress general secretary in-charge of Goa Digvijaya Singh on Friday told NDTV that there was no reason for him to resign for the party's inability to form the government in Goa when he had delivered on his mandate.

""I have delivered the result...Why should I resign?"" Mr Singh told NDTV when asked if he too -like party leaders have been offering to do in other states - would take responsibility for the Congress' failure to get the numbers to form the government in the state under his charge.

The senior Congress leader counted the Aam Aadmi Party's failure to get a single seat and a sharp decline in the BJP's tally from 22 in 2012 elections to 13 seats his achievement. ""We are the single largest party,"" he said.

The Congress won 17 of Goa's 40 assembly seats, just four short of the majority mark. But the BJP, which had just 13 lawmakers moved quickly to tie-up with smaller parties and staked claim to form government, getting an invitation to do so from Governor Mridula Sinha. The Congress says the governor should have first consulted it as the largest party on whether it had the numbers to form government. It has called the invite ""a murder of democracy"" and threatened to move a motion against the Governor in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA is in a minority.

Mr Singh made it clear that he wasn't fighting shy of taking responsibility for everything that happened in Goa but this didn't mean he was wrong.

""I take full responsibility but I think I have done the right thing and I stand by it others... I am not quitting,"" he said.

In a series of tweets earlier in the day, the senior Congress leader had gone public with how the party could have formed the government if his strategy to ally with the Vijay Sardesai-led Goa Forward Party before elections had been implemented. But the move was ""sabotaged"", he said, a reference that opposition from some state leaders to this tie-up. If he had had his way, Mr Singh suggested, the Congress - and not the BJP - would have formed the government.

Mr Singh had also outlined his success in improving the party's tally, something that he believes sets him apart from other leaders heading states where Congress suffered heavy losses.

Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar had offered to step down after the party's dismal performance in the assembly election; the Congress won just seven of the 105 seats contested in UP. In Odisha, the general secretary in-charge of BK Hariprasad made the offer after the Congress ended up with just 60 of the 850 seats in last month's panchayat polls.","new delhi:"
"313","Demonisation, Not Demonetisation That Won In The Assembly Polls: Kapil Sibal","                             Targeting the BJP government at the Centre, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Kapil Sibal on Monday said that it is ""demonisation"" and not demonetisation that succeeded (in the recent state assembly elections).

""Don't think demonetisation has succeeded. It is demonisation that has succeeded,"" Mr Sibal said during a discussion on the Finance Bill 2017 in the Rajya Sabha.

Mr Sibal's remarks came immediately after he accused Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of unjustifiably shaming the common people by saying that they evade income tax.

""The Finance Minister in his budget speech made a very passionate appeal and in fact told the people of this country that all of them are dishonest, because they don't pay taxes. He said that out of 125 crore people in this country, only 3.17 crore pay taxes,"" Mr Sibal said.

""But if you calculate, sir, there are just three crore people in this country who are able to pay taxes. And you are telling people that they are dishonest as they don't pay taxes and that's why you are unleashing this terror regime,"" he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8 last year, just months ahead of the assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP has got a thumping majority.

PM Modi had called it a step towards the fight against black money. The BJP also included issues such as Ram temple in Ayodhya, triple talaq and closure of slaughterhouses in its poll pitch.

Taking strong exception to certain amendments moved by the government in the Finance Bill, Mr Sibal said that these provisions seek to give a push to crony capitalism, weaken the federal structure of the country, allow the government to snoop on citizens and instill fear in the business community.

The Congress leader said that the Bill removes the cap on corporate funding to a political party and the new provisions do not require the donor to disclose who it donated to.

""The Bill seeks to amend Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, which requires a company to disclose any donation above Rs. 20,000. The cap of maximum donation of 7.5 per cent of the net profit of a company has also been removed. Now, not even the shareholders would know to which party the money went,"" Mr Sibal argued.

Speaking on Aadhar, he said it was meant only for streamlining the public distribution system, but the present government wants to use it for snooping on the personal lives of citizens.

He said that linking everything to Aadhar entails the risk of all the personal details of an individual being hacked by hackers, apart from the government watching every activity of citizens.

He also objected to the ""unbridled powers"" given to taxmen through an amendment, by which tax officials are not required to give any reason for searching and making seizures, not even to the appellate tribunal.","new delhi:"

They had offered accommodation to Mr Kejriwal while he struggled to make a foray into the political arena. AAP today, returned the favour by giving them tickets to contest the upcoming municipal or MCD elections, and the assembly by-poll.

62-year-old Naren Jain had offered Mr Kejriwal his house when he had resigned after his first stint as Delhi Chief Minister and was looking for a place where he could stay and host party volunteers. Though Mr Kejriwal could not move into Mr Jain's home due to legal reasons, the AAP today gave him a ticket to contest the MCD elections from Chandni Chowk ward, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.

The other man who helped Mr Kejriwal was 57-year-old Harjeet Singh, who had given his 41, Hanuman Road bungalow to the Aam Aadmi Party during its initial days. Mr Kejriwal took up Mr Singh's offer. In fact, the central Delhi address was used by Mr Kejriwal to file his nomination paper as a Delhi resident during the 2013 Assembly election. Mr Kejriwal is otherwise a resident of Ghaziabad, where he was residing in the government quarters allotted to his wife, formerly with the Income Tax department, at Kaushmabi.

To return the favour, the party has now given Mr Singh a ticket to contest the Rajouri Garden Assembly by-election, where polling will take place on April 9. The seat fell vacant after Jarnail Singh resigned as an Aam Aadmi Party MLA to contest the recent Punjab Assembly polls.

An ardent Kejriwal supporter, Mr Singh is believed to have charged nothing from AAP for using his bungalow. The party office was later shifted to East Patel Nagar. After his resignation as Delhi Chief Minister during his first tenure, Mr Kejriwal had stayed put in his official residence at Tilak Lane. While he planned to vacate the residence, he scouted for an accommodation which could serve not only as a home but also a place where party leaders and volunteers could be hosted. He then zeroed down on 4-B Flagstaff Road, a quiet lane on Alipur Road in north Delhi's Civil Lines area, belonging to Mr Jain, son of former Congress MP from Chandni Chowk Bhiku Ram Jain.

The plan, however, ran into trouble after Mr Jain's elder brother claimed it to be a disputed property and threatened to approach the court. Mr Kejriwal then decided against moving into the accommodation. Now Mr Kejriwal's official residence and the 4-B Flagstaff Road bungalow are separated by just one bungalow. ""I had offered my home to Mr Kejriwal but the Congress played mischief. My intentions behind giving my house to Mr Kejriwal were very noble that could not materialise,"" Mr Jain said.","new delhi:"

According to the CMS pre-post poll study, more than Rs. 5,500 crore were spent by major political parties in the just-concluded assembly election in Uttar Pradesh (UP) alone.

The Election Commission of India allows Rs. 25 lakh per candidate for campaign expenditure, but it is best known secret that most candidates spend much more than what is officially allowed and what candidates declare after the poll. Campaign activities include a range of conventional and non-conventional activities. Print and electronic material, including wide screen projections, video vans and the like put together itself in this election was put at Rs. 600-900 crore. ""Every vote cast in UP involved a cost of about Rs. 750, which is highest in the country,"" the survey noted.

In the assembly elections, nearly Rs. 200 crore in Uttar Pradesh and over Rs. 100 crore in Punjab were confiscated, the report said, adding that what gets to electoral campaign pipeline is 4-5 times more than what gets confiscated by authorities.""Going by that trend, in 2017, Rs. 1,000 crore were estimated to be distributed among voters,"" it said.

The survey further noted that around 55 per cent voters sampled in Uttar Pradesh knew personally someone or the other in the neighbourhood who had actually taken money for vote in this or earlier assembly polls.

Surprisingly, the study noted that demonetisation has significantly hiked poll expenditure. ""In some constituencies where the fight was tight, the cash involved ranged between Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000 depending on the number of voters and influencing the role of a voter,"" it said.

Two-thirds of voters found that candidates spent a lot more than ever before. Some of the campaign methods adopted in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections include door-to-door, rallies, yatras, social media, advertising through television, newspapers and multi-screen projections, motor cycle rallies, langar and celebrity shows.","new delhi:"

Currently, opinion polls and surveys are also banned from predicting the prospects of various parties before voting, so it does not influence voters.

But today, in a statement, the powerful election body said the prediction of results in ""any form or manner by way of predictions etc. by astrologers, tarot readers, political analysts or by any persons during the prohibited period is a violation"" of the ban that is aimed at making sure voters are not influenced.

There should be no attempts ""merely to score brownie points against competitors for commercial reasons,"" the Election Commission added.

In the absence of opinion polls ahead of the recent round of assembly elections in five states, astrologers and tarot card readers also featured in television debates. Invited to make their predictions, some of them had presented diverse scenarios.

One group of astrologers forecast that the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance would win comfortably in Uttar Pradesh, while others predicted a massive BJP victory. Each side claimed the most accurate results, citing ""authentic analysis of birth charts and horoscopes"".

Pramod Gautam, the chairman of Vedic Sutram, was quoted by IANS as saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ""clearly the winner as his stars continue to be favourable"" and this would favour the BJP. After predicting three BJP wins in the past, Mr Gautam had proved to be correct for the fourth time.

She charged that ""the BJP won elections by rigging electronic voting machines"".

Ms Mayawati had said that a 'black day' will be observed every month against what she termed the ""murder of democracy"" by the BJP.

""We will approach court over the issue in the next two-three days,"" the BSP supremo told reporters in the Parliament premises. Earlier, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had rejected Mayawati's claim that the voting machines were rigged and said her demand for a re-poll using ballot papers was legally untenable.

The BSP, which had 80 legislators in the outgoing UP Assembly, managed to win just 19 seats in the 403-member House. Driven by the Modi wave, the BJP, along with its ally, had stormed to power in UP after 14 years, securing 325 seats, while the Samajwadi Party had won 47 seats and its ally the Congress seven seats.

Father Mulayam had warned against partnering with Rahul Gandhi
Congress in Uttar Pradesh headed for less than 10 seats
                                It turns out that Akhilesh Yadav's big decisions in his attempt to stretch his political legs and stride away from his father have backfired spectacularly. The 44-year-old Chief Minister today earned the distinction of being vanquished in the BJP's biggest ever result in India's most important state. Of 403 seats, the BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is placed to win 325. Akhilesh Yadav, on the other hand, had accrued 47, with his junior partner, the Congress, proving party pooper by adding just another seven.

""I guess the new government will provide better expressways, maybe people didn't like the freeways we built, and now a bullet train will be brought for UP,"" said Akhilesh Yadav in a press conference at his residence, appearing relaxed but not abjuring sarcasm. Mayawati, who was relegated to third place, has alleged that the voting machines in UP were rigged, raising feedback of the sore loser variety. ""If a complaint has been raised, the government should look into it. I will also study this,"" he said.

He is not short of material to scrutinize. Whether entwining with the Congress was an unforced error is arguable. Akhilesh Yadav said recently that the alliance was formed when he was operating from a position of weakness, trapped in a long and public fight with his father, Mulayam Singh, for control of the Samajwadi Party. Mulayam Singh, 77, was categorical that a collaboration with any party, including the Congress, was unacceptable. Akhilesh Yadav felt differently. At a time when his party was riven by his family feud, he felt that the Congress would help consolidate the crucial Muslim vote, which accounts for 18 per cent of the population and serve as a beta blocker for the momentum generated by PM Modi.

He had announced that if he lost, it would be his last electionCaptain Amarinder Singh could not have hoped for a better 75th birthday. His party, the Congress, is making a comeback in Punjab after 10 years and he is expected to return as Chief Minister.

The Congress is set to win a huge majority in Punjab. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of Arvind Kejriwal, which had been tipped by many as the winner, is a poor second and the ruling Akali-BJP is last.

""Arvind Kejriwal is a summer storm, he came and he's gone,"" Amarinder Singh quipped about the man who had repeatedly challenged him during the campaign.

As for his party's victory, Amarinder Singh graciously credited Sonia Gandhi, who did not campaign at all, and Rahul Gandhi, who reserved much of his energies for Uttar Pradesh.

Popular as ""Captain"" among his supporters, Mr Singh had declared that this is his last election.

He said his first priority would be to fight drugs; Punjab's drug problem was depicted in the acclaimed movie ""Udta Punjab"" recently.

""The people of Punjab have given us a big mandate. I have vowed to finish drugs within four weeks,"" the Captain said.

He was non-committal on having the flamboyant cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu as his deputy.

""That will be decided by the Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi. All ministers will be decided by the party leadership,"" he said.

The Captain has not shared the warmest of ties with Mr Sidhu, who joined the Congress in January amid speculation that he was angling for the Chief Minister's post.

Congress' candidates have won or are leading in 76 seats in the 117-member Punjab Assembly. Prominent among them is Navjot Singh Sidhu, who quit the BJP to join the Congress before the elections and contested from Amritsar East. He credited his victory to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, which many expected to win the state, managed to bag just 23 seats, but scored better than the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance, which has won only 18 seats.

Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal has won the Jalalabad assembly seat with a margin of 18,500 votes defeating AAP's Punjab poster boy Bhagwant Mann.

Congress' Amarinder Singh, who will be Chief Minister, won the Patiala seat - his home turf - defeating AAP's Balbir Singh by a massive 52,407 votes. But he lost, Lambi, the other seat he contested to outgoing chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.

Is Rahul Gandhi mass leader? 'Will reserve judgement,' he said
Congress must introspect openly, that will help leaders: Dikshit
                                Sandeep Dikshit's willingness to call it like it has made him an outlier within the Congress, which picked his mother, 74-year-old Sheila Dikshit, as its candidate for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, before it allied with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. On Saturday, as the Congress was reduced to roadkill by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top-gear win in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Dikshit outlined the party's infirmities. Unlike the BJP, he said, the Congress does not invest in building leaders or backing them. He contrasted this with the BJP's early support for Mr Modi, which, he said, remained intact despite the allegations that as Chief Minister of Gujarat, he did not do enough to stop the communal riots in 2002 that seared the state, a charge rejected by the Supreme Court. ""We don't have a system to build and stand behind a leader. 2002-Modi-BJP is a great example. Modi was actually a liability for the BJP...but they stuck by Modi, gave him an opportunity, and see where he has gone,"" he said.

Mr Dikshit, 52, spoke to NDTV as it became clear that the Congress' defeat in Uttar Pradesh - despite an alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - boldfaces what the party insists on denying - that it is in the midst of its worst crisis in decades. Under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, who led the campaign against the PM in 2014, the Congress has racked up a series of huge losses. ""Would you step down now if you were Rahul Gandhi?"" NDTV's Prannoy Roy asked Mr Dikshit. Substantial pause, then - ""I'm not Rahul Gandhi.""

Mr Dikshit prefaced his comments with the acknowledgement that they are likely to irk the Congress, which brooks no argument of the quality of its Gandhi leadership. When asked if Mr Gandhi is a mass leader (all evidence suggests otherwise), he held his silence, for a bit, leaned forward, and then said, ""Can we use this election to read that? I don't know. I think I'll still reserve (my) judgement.""

Like other Congress leaders including Abhishek Manu Singhvi who appeared on NDTV today, Mr Dikshit said that it would be unfair to blame the party's debacle in India's prize state entirely on Mr Gandhi. He said the party's culture has become one of ""First, let's capture the Congress, (then) Congress will capture the votes,"" arguing that there is too much internal competition for party positions and that party managers have become more prominent and powerful than leaders with potential as vote-getters (he refused to say who this category includes within this Congress). He also said that if the Congress chooses- as it often has- to conjure a silver lining today, it will have missed the point. ""We'll be in trouble if we read this with satisfaction that we are re-nominated as the main opposition party, we will be in trouble"" he said.

He also called out the party for its ducking of transparent discussions, saying it's essential for ""systems within (an) organization to help leaders improve or build themselves.""","new delhi:"

 The Congress has returned to power in Punjab with a huge majority, winning 77 seats in the 117 member assembly. The Akali-BJP combine, which was in power for 10 years, was reduced to number three, after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which won 22 seats.

Mr Sidhu, a former BJP MP, won the assembly election from the Amritsar-east constituency by a margin of 42,409 votes against his BJP and AAP rivals.

The popular commentator joined the Congress just days ahead of the February polls in the state and was a star campaigner along with Captain Amarinder Singh, who headed the party's campaign.

AAP was Mr Sidhu's original destination after he quit the BJP in September, upset about being sidelined and denied his Amritsar seat in the 2014 election. Mr Sidhu briefly headed his political front 'Avaaz-e-Punjab', a non-starter, before turning his focus to the Congress.

""Arvind Kejriwal lost because his niyat (intention) was not pure. He wanted everything for himself,"" Mr Sidhu said, taking a dig at the AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister, whose party suffered defeats both in Punjab and Goa.

The party is way ahead of the Congress, with 18 of the state's 40 seats. Three of the four surveys -- which were averaged by the poll of exit polls -- did not rule out a majority for the party. The ABP News-Lokniti predicted that the BJP will win 16 to 22 seats, India Today-Axis polls said 18 to 22 and India TV-C Voter gave a figure of 18 to 21. To cross the halfway mark, the BJP needs 21 seats - exactly the number it won in 2012. India News MRC said the party could win 15 seats and the Congress 10.

The poll of exit polls said the Congress -- which won 9 seats in the 2012 elections -- is likely to win 12 seats this time. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which entered the fray in Goa with high hopes after its sweep in Delhi, is likely to win 3 seats.

In absence of an outright majority, the role of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP can be crucial. The MGP, a BJP ally which won three seats last time, withdrew its support to the government in January after Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar sacked two of its ministers.

The party has since formed an alliance with the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM and Shiv Sena, which has declared it won't enter into an alliance with the BJP again.

Counting of votes will begin at 8 am today and trends are expected to start coming in at 11 am.

In the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh - India's largest and the most crucial to its politics - the BJP ran a hard-fought campaign to wrest power from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (which contested this time in alliance with Rahul Gandhi's Congress). An aggregate of Exit Polls have predicted a win for the BJP.

In Punjab however, all exit polls have predicted a wipeout for the ruling Akali Dal-BJP alliance and contest is seen between the Congress and the Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur election results will also throw up interesting political insights - critical for a read of the way things are shaping for the 2019 General Elections.

Counting will take place at 157 centres -- Punjab (53), Goa (2), UP (75), Uttarakhand (15) and Manipur (12). By 12 noon, a final picture could emerge on who would be the major players in the five states.

According to Election Commission guidelines, half-an-hour after the postal ballots are counted, the process of counting of EVM votes begins.

The 'ballot unit' is switched on in the presence of senior poll officials and counting agents of candidates and the result command keyed in to get the results per machine.

Where a paper trail audit or 'voter-verified paper audit trail' (VVPAT) has been used, the counting agent can call for a count of the paper slips in the drop box attached to the voting machine, but a final count is taken by the returning officer.

Once the results are declared, the names of the winning candidates will find mention in the gazette. The gazette notification will initiate the process to form the next legislative assemblies in the states.

The picture for Uttar Pradesh is clear - the BJP is ahead, based on an aggregate of the polls - whereas in Punjab, it's a very close call with one poll forecasting a perfect tie for the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party. Uttarakhand has definitively picked the BJP, according to most polls; the party appears to have retained Goa; Manipur's decision is no clearer with exit polls - one shows the Congress holding the state, another shows it switching to the BJP.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav told BBC Hindi that he cannot rule out seeking a partnership with Mayawati, if his alliance with the Congress falls short. ""I have always treated the BSP (Mayawati's party) with respect, so it's natural for people to assume we may seek her help. It's difficult to say at this point.

"397","On Election Commission Wishlist: Barring Candidates Who Default On Power, Water Bills","                             The Election Commission wants laws to be changed so that it can disqualify from contesting polls the candidates who do not clear their water and power bills.

It has asked the Law Ministry to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1951, so that such defaulters can be barred from contesting Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.

According to the poll panel, it will require amendment to the chapter-III of the RP Act which deals with electoral offences.

A new clause will have to be inserted therein for disqualification ""on the ground of being a defaulter of public dues"".

The issue is pending with the government. In an August, 2015 order, the Delhi High Court had asked the Commission to ensure that candidates contesting Lok Sabha and Assembly elections furnish a 'no dues certificate' from the agency providing electricity, water and telephone connections to their accommodation.

Since February, 2016, the Commission had been insisting on an additional affidavit in the prescribed format along with the 'No Demand Certificate' from the agencies providing these services.

A 'no rent due' certificate is also required in case the candidate had been occupying government accommodation during the 10 years leading to the polls.

The Delhi High Court, while delivering the verdict, had said that those wanting to contest elections will clear their dues after the order.

In March 2016, when the EC had met political parties here to discuss electoral reforms, it was told that the 'no dues certificate' for candidates was leading to corruption as bribes were being allegedly paid to obtain it.

Recently, the Commission had proposed that political parties, as a pre-condition for fielding candidates, furnish affidavit stating that they have not defaulted on dues on account of usages of public utilities.","new delhi:"

The 21 lawmakers were appointed as parliamentary secretaries to ministers in the Arvind Kejriwal government after AAP swept the 2015 assembly elections in the national capital. Last year, a complaint was filed with the President that the legislators - who cannot hold any public office that entitles them to benefits, financial or otherwise - should be disqualified for taking up the job. The Election Commission, which is mandated to give its recommendations, had started hearings last July.

The Commission has sent notice for the hearing to Prashant Patel who filed the complaint and the 21 lawmakers including Alka Lamba, Jarnail Singh, Adarsh Shastri and Rajesh Gupta, an EC official said.

Kejriwal had defended the appointments saying the legislators were helping the government deliver on the promises made to the people and weren't paid from the exchequer for the extra work that they put in.

The idea behind this provision was to draw a line between the legislature and the executive; so that legislators irrespective of their party affiliation were able to hold the government responsible in the assembly rather than be indebted to it.

As had been done on many occasions in the past by governments, the Kejriwal government tried to circumvent the constitutional bar by getting a bill passed in the assembly to exempt the parliamentary secretary's post from the office of profit. But President Pranab Mukherjee refused to clear the law.

The disqualification proceedings before the EC have also survived last year's high court verdict that scrapped the appointments, ruling that Kejriwal could not have appointed them without concurrence from the Lieutenant Governor.","new delhi:"

A delegation of the Congress party, led by AICC general secretary Ambika Soni and Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, and other leaders also demanded an investigation into the alleged pumping of crores of rupees into the state election.

It urged the Commission to ensure that no postal votes cast after the designated time of 5.00pm in the Uttarakhand Assembly polls on February 15 be counted.

""We would like to submit that breach of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was committed by Narendra Modi ji himself, amongst others, and an FIR should be filed against the perpetrator amongst others,"" the delegation said in a memorandum submitted to the poll body.

The delegation maintained that the EC should immediately instruct the State Election Commission to file an FIR against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, J P Nadda, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank (MP), Madan Kaushik (local candidate) and other BJP leaders and party candidates who addressed/participated in the election rally for alleged ""breach of MCC which can be clearly seen from the material available in public domain"".

""The EC should also launch a probe into the pumping of huge amount of unaccounted cash during election by the BJP. Besides, the poll body should ensure that no postal votes be counted, which were cast after the designated time of 5.00pm on 15.2.2017,"" the memorandum stated.

Ms Soni and Mr Rawat told the Commission that during the election campaigning in Uttarakhand, Mr Modi held a public rally in Haridwar on February 10, without the requisite permission from the poll watchdog and thus violated the MCC.

They said, on bringing the matter to the notice of Chief Election Officer of Uttarakhand and other authorities, a showcause notice was issued and since the ""BJP had failed to convince the EC through its reply, the commission had filed an FIR against the Haridwar Unit of BJP.""","new delhi:"

"455","As Doubts About Rahul Gandhi Grow, Leaders Wonder 'Who Will Bell The Cat?'"," HighlightsCongress suffered a loss in the Maharashtra and Odisha local polls
Officially, they blame infighting and lack of resources for the loss
The party has been losing state after state since the 2014 Union polls
                                The knives are out in the Congress party after it suffered another electoral debacle in the local elections of Maharashtra and Odisha. Officially, the party blames infighting and the lack of financial resources for its poor performance. However, senior leaders within the Congress party have now begun to question the abilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi - albeit in hushed voices.

Sources say, they are waiting for the outcomes of the ongoing elections in five states before raising the pitch of those questions. The big question, as one senior Congress leader says, is ""Who will bell the cat and question him?""

After the party's worst performance in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, Rahul Gandhi has taken the lead and tried to rebuild and campaign for the party across the country. But the results have been far from encouraging. The party has been losing state after state and has been virtually wiped out across the country.

Senior leaders in the party say there is no gameplan or strategy put forth on how to take on the Narendra Modi-led BJP government. Leaders, who requested not to be named, say Rahul Gandhi's attacks have been a non-starter and the recent victory of the BJP in Maharashtra and Odisha will have its impact on the last phase of voting in Uttar Pradesh. They also feel the long-awaited reshuffle will really bring little to the table as accountability and performance have never been the yardstick for the Mr Gandhi's leadership. The demand will, now, once again focus on whether Rahul Gandhi will be made the Congress president and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, play a more pro-active role.

Either way, the Gandhis are well aware that come March 11, any further political reversals will not only mean a big question mark on the Congress but particularly the abilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi.","new delhi:"

Uttar Pradesh has seen record seizure of Rs 115.70 crore cash, 20.29 lakh barrels of liquor worth Rs 57.69 crore, and narcotics weighing 2,725 kg worth Rs 7.91 crore, as per the progressive data recorded till yesterday of seizure made by the Election Commission-appointed surveillance teams.

The comparative figures for the detection and seizure of these illegal inducements in UP during the 2012 Assembly polls stood at Rs 36.29 crore cash and over 3,073 litres of liquor worth Rs 6.61 lakh.

A similar massive increase in seizure has also been noticed in Uttarakhand, where single-phase polls ended early this month, as Rs 3.40 crore suspected cash, 1.01 lakh litres liquor worth Rs 3.10 crore and over 81 kg of drugs worth Rs 37.88 lakh have been seized by these teams till now.

Polling in one seat (Karnprayag) of the state has been postponed as a candidate had died.

The comparative figures for seizure in the hill state during 2012 stood at Rs 1.30 crore cash, 15,151 litres of liquor worth Rs 15.15 lakh among others.

In Punjab, where the polls have ended now, the cash seizure this time stood at Rs 58.02 crore as compared to Rs 11.51 crore last elections, 12.43 lakh litres of liquor worth Rs 13.36 crore as compared to over 3,2978 litres worth Rs 2.59 crore and 2,598 kg drugs worth Rs 18.26 crore as compared to 53 kg worth Rs 54 crore during the 2012 Assembly polls.

Goa too has witnessed a similar trend with Rs 2.24 crore cash being seized at the end of one-phase polls on February 4, over 76,000 litres liquor worth Rs 1.07 crore.

The cash seizure in the beach state during last polls was a mere Rs 60 lakh while the drugs and liquor seizure was very less. The comparative figures of the seizure for Manipur, where polls will be held next month, could not be obtained.

""It looks like demonetisation has not affected those who deal in black money and other illegal inducements used to lure the voters before and during the polls season.

""The surveillance teams are, however, on their toes to thwart these efforts as much as possible,"" a senior Income Tax department official, involved in these operations, said.

The counting of votes for all the five states will take place on March 11.

The explanation came as a riposte to BJP President Amit Shah's barbs questioning her assessment of Mr Gandhi as ""still not mature and needs some time,"" and this despite handing him over the charge of a complex state like Uttar Pradesh.

""Please remember Rahul is still not mature, his age does not allow him to be mature. He is what... in his forties. Please give him time,"" Ms Dikshit had said in an interview to The Times of India on Thursday.

Her comments were quickly lapped up by BJP President Amit Shah, who did not waste any time to ridicule Mr Gandhi saying, ""immature Rahul should be kept at home"" instead of being sent to Uttar Pradesh.

With ""Don't twist my words"" hashtag, Ms Dikshit took to the Twitter on Friday to clarify her comments.

""Rahul has the sensitivity and concern of a mature leader. His words are those of a young, courageous and restless man,"" she stressed.

"470","How BJP's UP Win Will Impact Presidential Election. Numbers Explained"," HighlightsPresidential Election is due in July this year
President is elected by Electoral College - formed by 776 MPs, 4120 MLAs
BJP's huge win in UP will also improve the party's tally in Rajya Sabha
                                The BJP's electoral tsunami in Uttar Pradesh will not just dramatically change the party's numbers in the assembly but will have an immediate impact on the next Presidential elections in July when President Pranab Mukherjee completes his term.

For National Democratic Alliance or NDA the path to having its nominee elected as the next President has become much easier after the BJP and its allies won 325 lawmakers in UP, 57 in Uttarakhand and impressive 21 in Manipur. Since the results, the BJP has announced it is all set take charge in the state, claiming it has support of 31 legislators.

The President of India is elected by an electoral college that's formed by 776 parliamentarians and 4,120 legislators. The total strength of the electoral college is 10,98,882 votes and the halfway mark is 5,49,442 votes.

The NDA is now short of only about 25,000 votes and friendly parties like the Biju Janata Dal, AIADMK can easily bridge the deficit. But hours after its landslide, party president Amit Shah played down the numbers edge in the run up to the Presidential polls.

""The Electoral College is there and it will do its job,"" Mr Shah told reporters.

Next year, these results will also change the dynamics in the Rajya Sabha where the NDA government is in minority. In August 2018, 10 Rajya Sabha members of UP including BSP chief Mayawati will retire.

Of these 10 vacancies, majority will go to the BJP. The Bahujan Samaj Party, with just 19 lawmakers in a house of 403, will struggle to get Mayawati re-elected to the Rajya Sabha.

Overall 58 members will retire next August and the BJP is expected to get at least half of these seats.

But the numbers don't seem to deter the Congress. ""Yes, these numbers will give them the confidence but election arithmetic is different from raising people's issue,"" said PC Chacko, senior member of the party who's now overseeing the party's preparation for civic polls in Delhi next month.

Mr Chacko says it is their pressure that ""forced the Modi government to go back on the Land Acquisition Bill or more recently the issue of making Aadhar mandatory to avail benefits of the Midday meal scheme.""

""We will continue to oppose the Government where it is necessary,"" Mr Chacko said.","new delhi:"

The response comes a day after the BJP announced that it is all set to form government in Goa and Manipur, claiming it has support of majority legislators.

Manohar Parrikar, who will take oath as Goa Chief Minister tomorrow evening, met with Governor Mridula Sinha on Sunday and was invited to form the government. Mr Parrikar today said that he has resigned as union Defence Minister.

Accusing the BJP of ""murdering the democracy"", Congress' Priyanka Chaturvedi said, ""Mr Parrikar did not even contest election...no one knows if he is popular among the people of Goa... this is murder of democracy in broad day light.""

Rejecting the allegation, BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao said, ""We secured 4 per cent more popular votes than the Congress, we also have legislative majority to form government... they (Congress) don't have.""

Goa has 40 seats of which the Congress won 17, falling short of the magic number 21. The BJP, which is the incumbent, won 13. Many regional parties have extended their support to the BJP in Goa on a condition - Mr Parrikar will lead the government.

In Manipur, the BJP claims to have support of 31 legislators after scoring 21 seats in 60 seats assembly. Congress got the maximum seats - 27.

""We have letters of 30 MLAs and the 31st will send a letter to the Governor,"" said Himanta Biswa Sarma, who had joined the BJP from the Congress.

The decision came after a two-hour meeting of the party's parliamentary board, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, called specially to discuss the way forward after election results of the five states that were announced yesterday.

The party has named a group of observers who would visit the four states and report back to Mr Shah, said Union Minister JP Nadda.

"477","Arvind Kejriwal Alleges EVM Tampering. Do Vipassana, Says Harsimrat Kaur"," HighlightsArvind Kejriwal said 20-25% of AAP votes transferred to Akali-BJP combine
EVMs banned by nations abroad as they can be tampered with, he said
Mr Kejriwal has called for use of ballot papers in Delhi municipal polls
                                Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today raised questions about the Electronic voting machines in the Punjab assembly polls, saying 20 per cent to 25 per cent of AAP votes were transferred to the Akali-BJP coalition which was in power in the state. The number of votes polled by his party were far less in some areas than the number of volunteers the party, he said, adding the results fly in the face of predictions by several exit polls and political experts.

Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, daughter in-law of Akali Dal Chief Parkash Singh Badal, was quick to hit back. ""He (Kejriwal) has lost his mental balance so he is saying things like this. He did not say anything when AAP had won 67 seats in Delhi... He should do vipassana,"" she told reporters.

In his first interaction with the media after the results of the assembly elections were declared, Mr Kejriwal said his party was expected to win the elections. ""What then, went wrong? There was no word of Congress coming to power... yet they swept the elections... really don't know how that happened,"" he said.

The Congress had won 77 of Punjab's 117 seats. All exit polls had predicted a hung house for Punjab - the poll of exit polls had suggested that Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party would be neck and neck with the Congress.

Electronic Voting Machines, Mr Kejriwal said, had been banned by some nations abroad because they can be tampered with. To conduct free and fair polls in India, they should be discontinued. ""Our Supreme Court had said in the past that it is possible to tamper with EVMs. I'm not saying this, the Supreme Court said this,"" he said.

Citing an example, Mr Kejriwal said, ""In (Punjab's) Shri Govindpur we got 1 vote... there are 5 volunteers who swear they voted for us... similar instances across the state... where did all the votes go? There is something seriously wrong.""

Mr Kejriwal demanded that the votes registered in the EVMs be compared with the VVPAT trail (voter-verified paper audit trail) in nearly 32 places in Punjab. ""It is about the credibility of the Election Commission and the faith of people in the electoral system. We have strong prima facie evidence of foul play,"" he said.

After the BJP's sweeping victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections and the dismal performance of her own party, Mayawati had called for a switch to ballot papers, alleging that EVMs or Electronic Voting Machines, make rigging easy.

Mr Kejriwal has called for the use of ballot papers in the coming municipal elections in Delhi - a request that has been turned down by the Election Commission, which said such a change requires more time than it at hand. The civic elections are due on April 22.","new delhi:"

Preempting a similar announcement in Manipur, it has also sent a letter claiming first right to form the government.

""As per well-established constitutional convention and propriety, the single largest party is invited to form the government and prove its majority on the floor of the House. It has come to our notice that through media reports that BJP has been invited to form the Government and the oath is scheduled on 14th March 2017,"" Congress said in a letter to Goa Governor Mridula Sinha. The party has also sent a similar letter to the Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla, sources said.

Ms Sinha had invited the BJP to form the government after it staked claim, saying it had the support of eight additional legislators required over its 13 to form a majority in the 40-member assembly. Three legislators each of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP and Goa Forward party and two independents have lent support to the party. The Congress and its allies had won 18 seats.

The letter from the Governor's office said that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who maintained till late Sunday evening that he had not resigned, has been appointed Goa Chief Minister - one of the key conditions of the allies and an unanimous demand of the BJP's own legislators. He will have to prove his majority in the assembly within 15 days of taking charge.

But the Congress says that Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost both the constituencies he fought was a sign of the people's firm rejection of the BJP.

""Our political opponents (BJP) despite losing the mandate of the people have tried to misrepresent to your good-self that they enjoy the majority support of legislators. This is not only opportunism of the lowest kind but is also not constitutionally permissible,"" it said.

The party claimed it too had the required numbers to form government and were in ""a position to prove the same on the floor of the House"".","new delhi:"
"484","Arvind Kejriwal Says Winning And Losing Will Be Part Of AAP's Political Adventure","                             After AAP's defeat in Punjab in the assembly elections, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that winning or losing is part of the ""political adventure"". He told AAP volunteers there was no reason for the party to give up.

In a break from his combative tone, where he has even questioned the reliability of the electronic voting machines (EVM), Mr Kejriwal urged volunteers to ""keep the faith"" alive. He will be interacting with the volunteers through Facebook Live on March 18, an AAP leader said.

""We will need time to fully understand the 'why and how' of these results. However, before thinking about what next, we need to understand that winning and losing will be part of our political adventure. The BJP has 18 seats and 20 per cent vote share in Karnataka and the Congress 15 seats and 18 per cent vote share in Maharashtra. They have not given up and there is no reason for us to give up,"" Mr Kejriwal wrote in a letter sent to all registered volunteers.

The letter, however, skips the issue of alleged rigging of voting machines in Punjab as raked up by the AAP chief yesterday. ""Although we did not get the expected results, we are now the opposition in Punjab. Also, we have got six per cent votes in Goa and we are just one state away from becoming a national party,"" he said.

Mr Kejriwal has alleged that EVM tampering may have led to the transfer of around 20-25 per cent of the AAP votes to the SAD-BJP combine. The Akalis got a drubbing in the Punjab polls, winning just 15 seats in the 117-strong assembly, while its ally BJP won three. The AAP finished a distant second behind the victor Congress, winning just 20 seats.

""You believed in us when we took our first baby step, had no experience in contesting elections, and did not know whether we could win even a single seat. Keep the faith, keep up the fight, Hum honge kamyaab,"" he said.

"487","PM Narendra Modi Uses Victory Speech To Counter Criticism, Urge Humility"," HighlightsPM thanked voters of the states whose results were declared yesterday
The victory celebration was attended by senior BJP leaders and ministers
PM Modi also attended a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board
                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi discarded his fortified SUV to walk a short distance to the BJP office in Delhi today which was surrounded by party workers waiting to celebrate him. As he moved past, flowers rained down on him as elite commandos in combat gear circled their VVIP.

The celebrations for the outsized results in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were turned by the BJP into a launchpad for future elections.

PM Modi thanked the voters of the five states whose results were declared yesterday and used his victory speech to counter criticism. The party has been rebuked by opponents and others for not fielding a single Muslim candidate in Uttar Pradesh. ""The BJP government is for those who have voted, (and) not voted for the party... no government has the right to discriminate. People are with or against some party only till the time of voting. Now, the UP government belongs to the people of UP,"" he said.

Top cabinet ministers, organisational leaders and Chief Ministers of different states were in attendance as Mr Modi was thanked for his leadership.

Political opponents charge his government with rising arrogance. The PM cautioned his party in a speech that was frequently interrupted by cheers of ""Modi, Modi"" that ""We have reached this position after hard work by four generations...winning requires us to be more humble. A tree may grow tall, but it can bend if it bears lots of fruit.""

To stress that outright landslide wins which have decimated the opposition will not result in over-confidence, the PM said, ""We may makes mistakes, but we will always be well-intentioned. We will work our hardest,"" he said (his punishing schedule is well-acknowledged), adding that, ""I am the first PM who is often asked about working so hard. We will always serve the people.""

If there was one over-riding theme to his speech, it was that there is a ""New India"" that is centered on its youth, and its aspirations, and its willingness to bear difficulties in the larger interest of progress, a reference to his demonetisation drive that was ridiculed by opponents but has been welcomed by the people.

It is now accepted even by rivals that his re-election is certain in 2019. The PM too suggested that he is drafting his agenda for a second term, highlighting that progress on key areas must be delivered ""by 2022 - when the country would be celebrating 75 years of independence.""

Pro-poor policies like free gas connections for the rural poor have served the BJP well in these elections, and the PM stressed, ""There is a need to raise aspirations among the poor to find opportunities to do better.""

In concert with this was his focus on development, which he described as ""a tough issue to highlight in a campaign...for 50 years, parties have been afraid to use this plank.""

His assertion that the BJP is going through a golden period has unquestionable evidence. The sea of BJP workers certainly agreed. They cheered him as he walked by. They danced in the street to patriotic songs. And each time they caught a glimpse of him on the plasma screens relaying his speech, they shouted his name.","new delhi:"
