  AICC incharge of communications department Randeep Surjewala said the parties must put the country first in the ""battle of ideologies"", remarks which come in the backdrop of attempts by leaders like JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee to rally anti-BJP forces to stop the saffron juggernaut.
  

  

  He also congratulated the BJP for its emphatic victory in Delhi MCD elections, in which Congress has been relegated to the third spot, and hoped it will work for a clean, corruption-free and development driven Delhi.
  

  

  ""Hope all regional parties will now realise that blind anti-Congressism is not the way. Country must come first in the battle of ideologies,"" Surjewala said on twitter.

The state election commission has sent the final results of the civic polls to the LG, who will notify them. Following this, the newly-elected councillors can initiate the process for nomination and election of mayor and other positions.
  

  

  BJP won in 181 wards out of the 270, which went to polls on April 23. AAP bagged 48 seats and Congress just 30. ""Once the LG notifies the results of the elections, the newly elected representatives can take charge,"" said a senior official at SEC.

  While 50% of the seats are reserved for women in each corporation, the DMC Act stipulates appointment of a woman councillor as the first mayor during the five-year term of the municipal corporations. The mayor is changed every year. The mayors, deputy mayors and members of standing committees of the three corporations will be elected in the first meeting of the elected councillors.
  

  

  BJP has initiated the process of shortlisting names for the mayor's post in each corporation. There are over 200 candidates who will become councillors for the first time. Sources claim that the new members will be trained by former councillors in the next few days and help them understand their role.
  

  

  Sources in BJP say that Kamaljeet Sehrawat and Shikha Rai are the front runners for the mayor's post in the south civic body. Sehrawat won from Dwarka B ward by 9,000 votes, which was the highest margin this election, while Rai emerged winner from Greater Kailash ward by more than 8,000 ballots.
  

  

  BJP had fielded new faces for this year's polls and won by a bigger margin than the last civic elections."

Even then, it was only the last few votes that gave Tanwar the narrowest of wins by 2 votes over Pinky Tyagi. ""The ward was equally divided between AAP and us. We eventually got 8,145 votes, while they got 8,143,"" Tanwar said.
  

  

  Bhajanpura in east Delhi also saw a close race, but the story here was a bit different. Although BJP candidate Gurjeet Kaur managed to beat Congress rival Rekha by 58 votes, the counting wasn't a comfortable experience for either. ""We had a healthy lead initially, but it kept decreasing every round, leaving us nervous and shaken,"" Kaur's husband admitted.

"Change of guard in AAP after defeat","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/change-of-guard-in-aap-after-defeat/articleshow/58408096.cms","NEW DELHI: Chastened by the humiliating results of the municipal polls, the Aam Aadmi Party began restructuring the party set-up in the capital. On Thursday, the Political Affairs Committee led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appointed state labour minister Gopal Rai as the convenor in Delhi.
  

  

  A day after the results, Kejriwal met the AAP MLAs and asked them to fan out in their constituencies to assess the reason for the party's poor show. In the meeting, many MLAs discussed factors other than AAP's official line that the voting machines were unreliable. Some key issues broached included organisation building, re-assessment of the party's mass communication and outreach strategies and the need to enhance interactions with volunteers. BJP's campaign strategy centred on PM Narendra Modi also came up for discussion, sources said. There was admission that with back-to-back elections in Punjab, Goa and Delhi, the party had not got enough time to come up with a counter to BJP's strong pitch.

  On the key reason that AAP thinks it lost the polls — manipulation of EVMs — party MLAs corroborated the accusations by submitting information at Thursday's meeting about specific booths where they alleged the election process had been compromised. The party leadership would look into such cases to take them up with the authorities concerned.
  

  

  However, there were others in the party who felt they should move away from EVMs and consider strong communication strategies such as better outreach through jan sabhas. This was necessary, the AAP members said, because the party had failed to acquaint the masses with the good work done by Delhi government. On Wednesday itself, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra, in a video message, had expressed the hope that AAP would introspect about the electoral route instead of simply blaming the EVMs.

  On Thursday evening, the Political Affairs Committee ratified the decision to make Gopal Rai, known for his skills in team management, the convener of the Delhi unit. Rai replaced Dilip Pandey, who was in the post ever since AAP came to power in Delhi in 2015. Pandey submitted his resignation soon after the poll results put AAP at a distant second with 48 seats against the 181 that BJP won in the three civic bodies.
  

  

  The party will also have to deal with a spate of other resignations. Delhi in-charge Ashish Talwar had resigned on Wednesday night, while APP's Punjab in-charge Sanjay Singh and co-in-charge Durgesh Pathak submitted their resignations on Thursday over the party's unexpectedly poor performance in the Punjab assembly elections. Both Singh and Pathak had offered to resign right after the Punjab results were announced, but were refrained from demitting charge till the Delhi municipal polls."
"In high-stake contest, PM Modi BJP lifeline","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/in-high-stake-contest-modi-bjp-lifeline/articleshow/58389176.cms","NEW DELHI: Unlike 2015, the 'Modi wave' this time has helped BJP not just tide over strong anti-incumbency but improve its tally -- from from 138 to 181-- in the three corporations and crush the ruling AAP. In a strategic move, the party planned the election campaign around the Narendra Modi government's achievements and asked voters to make the national capital 'Narendra Modiji ke sapno ki Dilli'.
  

  

  Though corporation elections are largely about local issues, BJP focused on the Centre's work as this was a high-stake election. Victory in this election was crucial for BJP, which is on a winning spree, to remain relevant in state politics. ""Unlike other political parties, we decided to run a positive campaign to tell people about the achievements of the Modi government. And people have responded positively to our campaign,"" said Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.
  

  

  Though BJP had to fight strong anti-incumbency due to its poor performance, it successfully turned the municipal elections into a ""referendum on the AAP government"". Party members say people could connect with BJP's campaign due to ""lack of governance"" in the city under AAP's rule. The party has been running a sustained campaign, attacking the AAP government for lack of development in the city, citing the ruling party's political ambitions as the prime reason.

  Another major decision, which many said would harm the party, was to deny tickets to sitting councillors and their relatives. There were protests by councillors and some decided to contest the election independently. But this didn't impact the party, which was quick to expel 21 rebels days before polling. ""It was a bold decision which all our party workers accepted. There was no major opposition within the party. We could take this decision as we have strong organizational base,"" said Shyam Jaju, Delhi BJP in-charge. Wednesday's verdict showed that rebels couldn't cause much damage to the party.
  

  

  After its crushing defeat in the 2015 assembly elections, BJP had carefully worked out its strategy to revive the party in the state. The first major step in this direction, BJP members say, was to appoint the Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician as its state unit chief. ""The demography of Delhi has changed over the years. Tiwari is an MP, a celebrity and party's Poorvanchali face. His appointment has infused the party with new energy,"" said a party member. Tiwari successfully took forward the party's campaign to highlight lack of development in the city by staying in slums and villages.
  

  

  BJP members say the party's decision to field 34 Poorvanchalis played a crucial role in its victory in wards with a large number of unauthorized colonies and slum clusters that were considered AAP strongholds.
  

  

  It also helped BJP that senior Congress leaders like Arvinder Singh Lovely, Barkha Shukla Singh and Amrish Gautam crossed over to its fold ahead of the elections."

    , tells that the party's track record of good governance has earned it great credibility. Excerpts:
  
  

  

  What were the key factors in BJP's win?
  

  

  First, it is the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, who has become a symbol of national aspiration for development and good governance. In our national president Amitbhai Shah, we have a master strategist. Besides, there was our track record of good governance which has earned us great credibility. And let's remember that people always vote for those who are seriously into politics with a robust organisational network and clear and sound policies.
  

  

  
    Whose idea was it to drop sitting corporators?
    

  
  

  In our party, all decisions are taken collectively under the leadership of our president. Dropping incumbent corporators was an experiment that we have done in the past too. This decision was not unusual, at least in BJP.
  

  

  
    But there was a risk of rebellion.

  Well, one can always expect some rumblings and unpleasantness after this kind of decision. But we know that ideology-driven and cadre-based parties can digest such decisions and that is what actually happened. We could, at the end of the day, manage such issues.
  

  

  
    Amit Shah was actively involved in the polls.
    

  
  

  Yes and he was supremely effective. In fact, there are three Ds that go with Amit Shah's name. First is dedication. He works for nearly 16-17 hours and makes others work too. Second is his decisiveness. He is known for taking even difficult decisions very firmly. Then, his discipline. He remains and also makes everybody accountable.
  

  

  
    How do you see the AAP's politics?
    

  
  

  Their politics is a combination of opportunism and obstructionism. Party politics is much more than dharnas and demonstrations. There are parties whose ideology is unclear, organisation is fast becoming obscure and politics very reactionary. Why will people repose their confidence in them?"

"Last-placed, infighting cost Congress heavily","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/last-placed-infighting-cost-congress-heavily/articleshow/58389223.cms","NEW DELHI: As Congress finished a poor third in the municipal elections with a seat tally of 30 as against its previous tally of 77, hopes for its revival in Delhi appear bleak. Taking responsibility for the party's dismal performance in the polls, Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken resigned but not before blaming former CM Sheila Dikshit and other senior politicians for not extending a helping hand during election campaigns.
  

  

  The Congress revival story was badly hit by infighting, which peaked when former PCC chief and former Delhi minister Arvinder Singh Lovely joined BJP just before the polls. Another former MLA and Mahila Congress president Barkha Singh too crossed over to BJP.
  

  

  In this backdrop, the poll results saw Congress win 12 seats in the south corporation, 15 in north and just three seats in the east corporation. The number of seats has gone down from 2012, when Congress won 19 seats in the east corporation, 29 each in south and north civic bodies.
  

  

  In the east, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had joined the safai karamcharis who were on strike in 2015 and the party's main agenda, for this election, revolved around the same issue but it failed to make an impact.
  

  

  Despite its complete marginalisation, Congress is comparing this year's municipal poll results with the assembly election results of 2015 when it failed to open its account and claims that there has been a rise in the vote share by 11%.
  

  

  Leader of the opposition in the east corporation Varyam Kaur, who contested from Gandhi Nagar ward, lost to BJP by a margin of 9,000 votes. Kaur, who was considered a heavyweight, lost to Kanchan Maheshwari, a first-timer from BJP. Another heavyweight Virender Kasana, councillor from CR Park, lost to BJP's Subhash Bhadana and Praveen Rana from Bijwasan ward lost to AAP candidate Narender Rana.
  

  

  On the brighter side, Andrews Ganj councillor Abhishek Dutt retained his seat—he won by more than 4,000 votes and Yasmeen Kidwai, who contested for the first time from the Daryaganj ward in place of leader of the opposition in south corporation Farhad Suri, won the seat. A total of 92 candidates forfeited their deposits.

  Last week, Maken had confidently announced that Congress would come to power in the three corporations, claiming that the party was on a strong wicket after the Rajouri Garden bypoll. In the bypoll that held on April 9, Congress vote share had gone up from 9% to 33%. But what followed next was a string of resignations from the party and posts.
  

  

  The first blow came when former cabinet minister A K Walia threatened to quit the party over ticket distribution. Thereafter, several other senior functionaries, including Sandeep Dikshit and Mangat Ram Singh came out in open and criticised Maken's alleged high-handedness in the managing the election affairs.
  

  

  After Congress retained the second position in Rajouri Garden bypoll, the major blow came from former DPCC chief Lovely, who joined BJP.
  

  

  Former Sheila Dikshit and senior functionary Harun Yusuf stayed away from the campaign. Dikshit had said she was not asked to campaign while Maken claimed to have sent a letter to every senior leader of Congress to join the poll campaign."

Though Arvind Kejriwal's party did win in a number of Muslim-majority areas, the margins were lower than those recorded two years ago.
  

  

  A day after BJP astonished Delhi by retaining the corporations for a third consecutive term, many Muslims confessed that on polling day they had been unsure of AAP's prospects due to, as one put it, the ""media's insistence that there is a wave against AAP"", and this had affected their voting decision. Iftikhar Ahmed, a watch seller in Batla House in south Delhi, nuanced this by explaining that AAP's loss was ""because every election has a wind in favour of one party, and this time there was a wave against AAP"".
  

  

  However, Ahmed was unwilling to blame only a wave to the exclusion of other factors. In fact, he said, ""AAP's reputation has dwindled due to its inadequacies in managing the city after coming to power."" And this perception that Kejriwal's party is doing little for the community is driving voters away.
  

  

  In Okhla, Muslims did not support AAP — as it had in electing the party's Amanatullah Khan as MLA in 2015 — because ""the promises made to us have not been fulfilled"", according to Zia Ul Haque, a plywood shop owner. Haque said that the CM often tweeted about new schools and hospitals in other areas, ""but nothing of this sort has been done for us"".

  Perhaps the division of votes to the detriment of AAP was most stark in Zakir Nagar in south Delhi, where Shoaib Danish of Congress retained his seat by just 1,070 votes, despite, as a voter grumbled, ""poor maintenance of the area for many years"". AAP's Mehmood Ahmad lost out because many of his supporters opted for RJD's Muslim candidate, even as Congress retained its base.
  

  

  Besides the divided support, Muslims voters suggested AAP has lost their trust. ""People had given AAP a chance thinking that it was new and would usher in progress in areas like ours,"" said Naeem, a butcher in Chitli Qabar in the Walled City. ""But we have only heard AAP leaders talking about how powerless they are."" Others said they had great hopes from AAP MLA Alka Lamba, but ""she is rarely seen in our localities"".
  

  

  Parvez Akhtar, a Turkman Gate shop owner, accused the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation of not providing enough funds to sitting corporator Aaley Mohammad Iqbal of Congress, who, he said, ""spend from his pocket to help the people"". Iqbal vanquished AAP's Riyazuddin by 7,519 votes.
  

  

  Kejriwal's image of a confrontationist also alarmed Muslims. Raeesuddin, a restaurant owner in Jama Masjid area, said, ""While the councillors say the MLA doesn't give them funds, Kejriwal told us the central government doesn't let him work."" Fed up, Raeesuddin said, the Muslims voted for the party with which they have always been comfortable."

In the first year, the posts are reserved for women.
  

  

  While there is still time to finalise the candidates, several names are already doing the rounds for the key posts — Kamaljeet Sehrawat, Shikha Rai and Nandani Sharma are among the potential candidates for south Delhi.
  

  

  Sehrawat, a former president of Delhi BJP's women's wing, is a strong contender as she has won from Dwarka-B ward by 9,866 votes, the highest margin in the polls this time. Party members said she was very active as the president of state unit's women's wing. Rai, who is a vice-president in Delhi BJP, too has a strong hold in the party.
  

  

  While most councillors are first-timers, BJP members said the party's s election for mayoral candidate would be based on experience and seniority. ""We will start the process soon. It will be a mixture of experience and fresh faces. We will select candidates who can ensure smooth implementation of party's agenda,"" said Harish Khurana, Delhi BJP spokesperson.

  In north Delhi, names of Preeti Agarwal, who is a secretary in Delhi BJP, and Poonam Parashar Jha, head of Delhi BJP's women's wing and wife of former BJP MLA from Kirari Anil Jha, are strong contenders. Party members said Anju Jain, a second-time councillor, might also be considered due to her experience. She was elected a councillor in 2007.
  

  

  In east Delhi, Neema Bhagat, who won from Geeta Colony, is the top contender as she is a second-time councillor.
  

  

  While BJP members said there would not be much problem in selecting the mayors, the real challenge would be in appointing the standing committee chairmen, leaders of the House, zonal chairmen and members of various committees on health, education, horticulture, etc. ""The party plans to strengthen the leadership at the zonal level, as the zone chairmen will ensure proper implementation of all policies, which will be prepared by the corporations,"" said Praveen Shankar Kapoor, media in-charge, Delhi BJP.

"3 AAP councillors brave the wave","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/3-aap-councillors-brave-the-wave/articleshow/58389070.cms","NEW DELHI: In an election where sitting councillors were steamrolled by the freshers of BJP, three AAP incumbents, elected to the municipal corporation in the by-polls last year, retained their seats. There weren't too many others on Wednesday, who like Ashok Kumar, Mohammad Sadiq and Ramesh Matiala, could boast of beating both anti-incumbency and the saffron wave.
  

  

  Kumar, who represented Vikas Nagar but was moved to Hastsal this time, was ahead of BJP's Harish Harjai by 965 votes. ""I humbly thank the people of my ward who gave me this opportunity to serve them. I had given my best in serving the people after last year's by-elections,"" Kumar said.
  

  

  The councillor, who has studied only up to Class X, said his humility and hard work had obviously caught the eye of the electorate. After moving to the new ward, Kumar strove to meet as many people as possible. ""I interacted with people from all sections, heard their problems and promised them my complete attention,"" he said.
  

  

  Matiala had a more comfortable relection from Matiala ward, beating his BJP rival Surendra Kumar by 3,857 votes. ""I thank the people of my ward for reposing faith in me,"" he said. AAP's sitting councillor from Ballimaran, Mohammad Sadiq, also weathered anti-incumbency handsomely, vanquishing Congress' Mohammad Qazzafi by 6,970 votes. Less than a year after winning the by-polls in May last year, Sadiq seemed to have a comfortable trust level with his electorate. ""I will use the opportunity to further help the people of my ward,"" Sadiq vowed.
  

  

  Rakesh Kumar too returned to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. Originally a member of Rashtriya Lok Dal, he had shifted to AAP in 2013 and won this year's contest from Ajmeri Gate triumphing over Congress' Abhay Singh Yadav by 1,952 votes.

  While Congress Andrews Ganj councillor Abhishek Dutta managed to retain his seat in Andrews Ganj and Shoaib Danish achieved a similar milestone in Zakir Nagar, their party heavyweight, Virender Kasana, yielded his Chittaranjan Park seat to BJP candidate Subhash Bhadana and Praveen Rana lost to AAP candidate Narender Rana in Bijwasan.
  

  

  ""People voted for me for my work and I will be glad to serve them again,"" said Dutt. ""We tried to do whatever we could done in the south corporation despite the hurdles and it paid off.""

  MCD elections+
  in 2012, dropping from 36.7% to 36.1%, but enhanced its seat tally from 138 to 181.
  

  

  In comparison to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, its vote share dropped by 10.5 percentage points from 46.6% and yet the number of wards where it finished in front came down by only 25 from 206 in those elections.
  

  

  Put that down to a more divided opposition vote this time and the vagaries of the first past-the-post system.
  

  

  The comparison with the 2015 assembly polls is equally dramatic. The
  BJP has gained+
  a relatively modest 3.9 percentage points of vote share since then but has seen its tally of wards jumped in the process from a mere 26 two years ago to 181 now.
  

  

  The explanation lies in what's been happening to the non-BJP vote in the meantime.
  

  

  In 2012, the Congress was the only major opposition to the BJP and polled over 30% of votes. As a result, it was able to restrict the BJP to just over half the total seats in the three municipal corporations.
  

  

  Two years later, in the Lok Sabha polls, the AAP had become a major factor in Delhi politics acquiring a vote share similar to the Congress in 2012, but the
  Modi wave+
  meant that the BJP's own vote share rose to nearly 47%.
  CATBIRD Blue Stylish Loafer For Girls 517-F W048-517-F-BlueShopcluesसिर्फ 2 हफ्ते में खत्म हो रही डायबिटीजGlyxGoRecommended By Colombia

  

  As a result, the BJP led in 206 of the 272 wards. The 2015 polls saw the BJP's vote share dipping to 32.2%, not drastically lower than in 2012, but with the Congress collapsing and AAP touching over 54%, a 30-something vote share was good enough for leads in only a little over two dozen wards.
  

  

  Does the fact that the BJP's vote share now is hardly different from 2012, when there was no Modi factor at all, mean there was no Modi effect in these polls?
  

  

  That would be a simplistic conclusion.
  

  

  For the BJP to have held on to its vote shares from five years ago in the face of a huge anti-incumbency after ten years of running the MCDs is no mean achievement, particularly considering that the polity has in the meantime become triangular rather than just bipolar. And much of that must be put down to the Modi effect neutralizing anti-incumbency. What the drop of over 10 percentage points since 2014 does mean however is that the Modi magic does not quite have the same effect in a municipal poll as it did in a national election. But that's hardly surprising."
"Sweep for BJP, Delhi dumps broom: Test for Kejriwal to keep his flock together","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/sweep-for-bjp-delhi-dumps-broom-test-for-kejriwal-to-keep-his-flock-together/articleshow/58388966.cms","NEW DELHI: BJP's gambit in replacing all its sitting municipal councillors, putting an outsider, actor Manoj Tiwari, at the helm of the state unit and using
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi+
  as a trump card has paid it handsome dividends in the elections to the three
  municipal corporations in Delhi+
  .
  

  

  It steamrolled AAP and restricted Congress to a modest revival by taking 181 of the 270 seats — that's over two thirds — for which polling took place last Sunday. Tiwari,
  Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav+
  — a former colleague of Kejriwal — and state Congress chief Ajay Maken have all invoked the idea of 'Right of Recall' to urge Kejriwal to step down as CM.
  

  

  ""A party which won 67 assembly seats just two years back couldn't win even 67 wards,"" said Tiwari, rubbing it in. For AAP, the outcome could not have been worse, coming as it did on the heels of its humiliating defeat in the Rajouri Garden bypoll and soon after its loss in Punjab and Goa.
  

  

  It was left vying with Congress for seats and vote share, doing marginally better than the latter. It got only 16 seats in south (BJP 70, Congress 12), 21 in north (BJP 64, Congress 15) and 11 in east (BJP 47, Congress 3). AAP had hoped it would be able to favourably contrast its performance in the state government with BJP's in the MCD, but the strategy didn't work.
  

  

  Also, by dumping all its sitting councillors, BJP managed to signal a clean break from its 10-year-old legacy even as it rode on Modi's huge post-UP popularity. Raising a scare over disease outbreaks because of the insanitary conditions in the city didn't serve AAP well. The party needs to introspect if it wants to remain a credible player in Indian politics, according to most political analysts. It, however, appears to be in a state of denial, having worked out a consistent strategy of blaming
  EVM-tampering+
  for defeats.
  

  

  ""BJP has done nothing but spread corruption, dengue and chikungunya in Delhi. There's no reason for people to vote for BJP again. It is unbelievable. If the margin of victory had been low we could have accepted it. But the huge difference is not possible without rigging the elections,"" said deputy CM Manish Sisodia.
  

  

  However, later in the day, Kejriwal congratulated BJP on its victory, saying in a tweet that his government ""looks forward to working wid (sic) MCDs for the betterment of Delhi"".
  

  

  The question on many lips is: Will Kejriwal & Co now get serious about engaging with the real issues - such as repairing roads and augmenting the bus fleet - instead of being in a permanent state of conflict with the Centre and bristling at every criticism.
  

  

  Kejriwal, who has stayed out of Delhi for long periods, will have to guard his flock that will now be more vulnerable to temptation from BJP.
  

  

  In case of an adverse verdict from Election Commission of India in the office-of-profit case, which will lead to the disqualification of 21 party MLAs, such attempts will assume urgency and could pose an existential crisis for AAP.
  

  

  For its part, BJP, after this massive mandate, cannot afford to let the rot within the municipal corporations it rules continue, say civic experts.
  

  

  It will have to bring about a perceptible change in the way the corporations function - from streamlining processes to sticking to deadlines to cutting out corruption.
  

  

  Blaming Kejriwal for denying funds to the corporations won't work because state party chief Tiwari had indicated that they would find new ways, like direct funding by the Centre.
  

  

  The fact that there has been a marginal decline in its vote share - from 36.7% in 2012 to 36.1% this time - should be a sobering thought.
  

  

  Tiwari's strenuous campaigning has helped him shake off the outsider tag; he also enjoys the central leadership's solid backing.
  

  

  The party's immediate challenge is to ensure sanitation and salaries for MCD staff. In this tri-polar contest, Congress chief Ajay Maken's efforts to revive his party's fortunes with virtually no support from other state leaders failed.
  

  

  Former chief minister Sheila Dikshit stayed away and no other leader was visible during campaigning. They say they were not made to feel welcome. There were rumblings within the fractious state unit over ticket distribution.

  Former minister A K Walia threatened to quit and east Delhi strongman Arvinder Singh Lovely dealt a severe blow to the party by actually doing so in a huff, promptly joining BJP.
  

  

  He was followed by former Delhi Commission for Women chief Barkha Singh, who even questioned Rahul Gandhi's state of health. Having improved its vote share in the Rajouri Garden byelection, Maken ran a largely positive campaign with multiple manifestoes on various issues.
  

  

  Given the heavy odds he was up against, there is no great surprise over the party's third-place finish. Although he has already sent in his resignation, he is seen as Rahul Gandhi's choice to run the party in Delhi and the options for Congress are limited.
  

  

  ""Our vote share went down to 9% in the 2015 assembly elections and from there it has improved. I took charge as DPCC president when Congress couldn't open its account in the 2015 elections. It has been a difficult journey and party workers worked really hard. We have made a reasonable comeback but it is not what I had hoped for,"" said Maken."

  On BJP's increasing footprint in urban local bodies, Naidu said the middle class has been supporting the party since its inception. ""The phenomenon is more in urban areas where youngsters, educated and the poor are attracted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his leadership.

So it might seem like the pollsters got it more or less right. But the reality is that they got what they actually measure horribly wrong but were saved by seat forecasts that weren't wildly off the mark.
  

  

  Exit polls actually measure voting intentions, that is which party is getting what vote share, and then try and convert that into votes. But the two exit polls for the MCD elections gave the BJP a vote share that was way higher than what the party actually got when the results were out.

  The India Today-Axis poll predicted that the BJP would win 43% of votes in the three municipal corporations put together, with its share varying between 41% in the North and 44% in the South and East. The ABP News-CVoter poll gave even higher vote shares to the BJP - from a minimum of 49.2% in the South to 52.3% in the North.
  

  

  The actual vote shares bagged by the saffron party varied between 34.9% in the South and 38.6% in the East to total 36.1% for all three corporations. That means the Axis poll got the figure wrong by about 7 percentage points and the CVoter poll by nearly 15 percentage points. Those are not small errors.
  

  

  Not surprisingly, both pollsters underestimated the AAP vote shares, though not by as large a margin. The Axis poll put it at 24% and CVoter at 18.6% while it actuall;y won 26.2% of the votes. Interestingly, the error in the case of the Congress was on either side of the actual number. The Axis poll overestimated the party's shares while the CVoter poll consistently underestimated it, but again not by huge margins.
  

  

  Fortunately for the pollsters, the gap between the BJP and AAP or Congress was so huge that these errors did not matter too much when it came to seat tallies. Thus, against the 200-plus seats that both had predicted, the BJP won 181, which seemed close enough for them to get away with the impression that they had gauged the vote right."

"MCD election results: Demonetisation, Narendra Modi worked wonders for BJP","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/demo-namo-worked-wonders-for-bjp/articleshow/58425833.cms","NEW DELHI: BJP's success in retaining its votebank and managing a 3.9% increase over the 2015 assembly polls is being read by the party as benefits of demonetisation, the Centre's Mudra Bank loan and Ujjwala schemes that gave it a ""pro-poor"" orientation.
  

  

  The strong welfare push seems to have given BJP a crucial edge in making inroads in the wards where it has fared poorly earlier and where delimitation was expected to favour its rivals. The demonetisation effect clubbed with focus on Poorvanchali community seems to have helped it gain votes in slums and unauthorised colonies. The JJ clusters, which have a sizable Poorvanchali population, had voted AAP to power in 2015.
  

  

  The party sealed its victory due to three-way division of votes and AAP's share falling steeply from 54.3% to 26.2%, as compared to 2015. Delhi BJP in-charge Shyam Jaju said, ""People have recognised the work done by the Modi government in the last three years.""
  

  

  ""We held camps in east Delhi for Mudra scheme and helped many take benefit of Ujjwala (cooking gas for BPL) scheme,"" said Virendra Sachdeva, member of BJP's good governance cell and former district president of Mayur Vihar.
  

  

  BJP's decision to appoint Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari as Delhi unit chief worked well in capturing the Poorvanchali vote, which is now a key component in Delhi politics.
  

  

  For the first time, the party gave tickets to 34 Poorvanchalis, including some from slums. ""It was a major step that helped us win in areas like Trilokpuri west, which had never voted for the party. Tiwari's night stay in slums and villages helped,"" said Sachdeva.

  In 2013, party candidate Vijay Bhagat had lost from Badli assembly constituency, but won from Sharda Nand Colony in 2017 municipal polls. Similarly, BJP has won in many wards in Burari, Kirari, Badarpur, Karawal Nagar, among others.
  

  

  ""In six assembly constituencies around Patparganj (represented by deputy CM Manish Sisodia), we have won close to 25 wards. We lost Jhilmil and our candidate's nomination was rejected from Vinod Nagar,"" said Abhay Verma, state vice-president.
  

  

  Focussing its campaign around PM Narendra Modi and people's perceived anger against AAP helped neutralise anti-incumbency. The three corporations had failed on numerous counts during the party's decade-long rule.
  

  

  Even delimitation seems to have worked out in BJP's favour. The party won three out of five wards in Najafgarh, the assembly constituency that BJP has won just once in 2013. Similarly, in Badarpur, the party won four out of five wards. The party also managed to retrieve more of its middle-class areas, ike Vishwas Nagar, Greater Kailash and Malviya Nagar that voted for Modi in 2014, but went with AAP in 2015."
"MCD result may spur opposition unity talks","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/mcd-result-may-spur-opposition-unity-talks/articleshow/58390085.cms","NEW DELHI: In a local election that went national,
  BJP's sweep of Delhi's municipal polls+
  emphatically underlines the party's political domination and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popular appeal with voters across the country and could spark moves to stitch opposition unity.
  

  

  The result, with
  Aam Admi Party and Congress+
  jockeying for second spot, gives BJP the satisfaction of settling scores with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for the humiliating drubbing it received in the 2015 assembly poll and the concerted manner in which the leader has attacked the PM since then.
  

  

  The implications of the election are far wider than a decision on who will fix the city's drains. For a party that was once seen as an alternative model in politics and a leader who could capture the popular imagination, AAP's slide on its home turf is nothing short of a May Day call for the outfit. BJP held onto its middle class support but seems to have made some inroads, aided by demonetisation, in AAP ""constituencies"" like unauthorised colonies and slums where Congress seems to have revived its fortunes too.
  

  

  The big gamble of changing almost all sitting councillors along with a decision to sideline the older guard in the city by installing north east Delhi MP and popular Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari as the Delhi party chief paid off handsomely. BJP president Amit Shah, who along with the PM, was instrumental in the crucial decision to junk all serving councillors, some of them known favourites of state and central leaders, was the game changer that wiped out a two-term incumbency that had delivered very average performance.
  

  

  Modi and the BJP chief had advocated a similar shock therapy for BJP candidates in Punjab but the plan did not go through due to concerns that it was too risky a gambit to attempt. With the UP win boosting confidence and adrenalin running high, Shah decided to brook no protest even though some BJP councillors had a good record to run on.
  

  

  BJP's continued rise can quicken opposition talks for a presidential candidate with Sonia Gandhi meeting Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.
  

  

  Regional parties facing BJP might be prompted to look at joining hands in an alliance though there remain strong contradictions within them. But with Congress on the decline, anti-Congressism could weaken.

  BJP's victory in wards comprising slum clusters, below poverty line and irregular colonies was enabled by the demonetisation which propelled Modi and BJP into the minds of the city's poor. The gambit to admit Congress leaders like Arvinder Lovely worked to demoralise the party that looked to be gaining.After UP polls, the Delhi outcome is yet another evidence that ""note ban"" has added new adherents from among con stituents of its rivals without loss of BJP's own voter base.The important win in Delhi cements BJP's string of wins in urban civic elections in several states and will encourage efforts to showcase itself as the party of the poor as Congress did under Indira Gandhi. During the third anniversary of the Modi government, there may be attempt to amplify the message further.
  

  

  BJP has become the party of choice for voters and politicians and Shah has pragmatically opened the doors for cross overs from Congress and other parties. The decimation of AAP should shrink the possibility of Kejriwal cutting into anti-BJP votes which have so far been cornered by Congress.

  The failure to make a significant mark even though its vote went up compounds Congress's problems not the least because its face Ajay Maken enjoyed the ""most-favoured person"" status under Rahul Gandhi and this enabled him to ride roughshod over protests from peers and seniors in Delhi politics -from Sheila Dikshit to A K Walia to Arvinder Lovely who joined BJP.
  

  

  The question of who should lead Congress as Sonia fades, will acquire a sharp focus though whether the veterans reeling under neglect from Rahul, given the unquestioning dependence on the family , will articulate fear of irrelevance agitating them, remains a big question. The outcome gives rise to serious questions about AAP's future, if Kejriwal continues to blame the defeat on AVMS and does not get down to diagnose the cause for the desertion of voters."
"From tea stall to Civic Centre: A Modi-fied story","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/from-tea-stall-to-civic-centre-a-modi-fied-story/articleshow/58425819.cms","NEW DELHI: A tea seller becoming an elected leader of the people — if PM Narendra Modi made this a paradigm of the Indian dream, Avtar Singh has lived out a similar dream too. If you don't quite recall Singh's name, you can be forgiven. For, it was only this week — when the returning officer in the Civil Lines municipal ward signed a certificate bearing his name — that the saffron-turbaned Sikh moved out of Ajmeri Gate's shadows and into the limelight.
  

  Mutual Funds ke liye FundsIndia Sahi HaiFundsIndiaDelight customers with a cognitive journeyIBMRecommended By Colombia

  After Singh lost his job as a hotel waiter in the 1980s, Singh eked out a living sell syrupy tea under a peepal tree in Ajmeri Gate for over a decade. But this was only an augury of good things. ""Selling tea is not a small job,"" he pointed out to TOI on Friday. ""You get to interact with people, so I made lots of friends."" His large circle of friends propelled him into local politics, and like the PM, he became strongly influenced by RSS.
  

  

  Destiny dealt a second ironic blow when he was jailed in 1994. As an organiser of the Ajmeri Gate Ramlila, Singh put up a religious hoarding on a site meant for government advertisements and was booked. In Tihar Jail, he despaired over his wife having to vend tea to be able to feed their two children. But it was also in jail that he came in contact with some political leaders. ""Before the court acquitted me of all wrongdoing, these leaders influenced my thinking and encouraged me,"" Singh recollected.
  

  

  Now, mindful of the many difficulties he has faced in life — dropping out of school after his father's death, doing odd jobs to pay for a diploma course on store-keeping, working as a waiter, selling tea for a living — Singh disdains the better life that his current courier business affords him. He continues to live in a humble 20-yard house.
  

  

  Singh today represents the upscale Civil Lines in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. But his elevation has not changed his outlook on life. The man who looks up to Atal Bihari Vajpayee as a role model rides on his modest grey scooter through Civil Lines every day, ensuring civic order in the ward."
"Can't just blame EVMs, time to introspect: AAP leaders divided after defeat in MCD polls","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/cant-just-blame-evms-time-to-introspect-aap-leaders-divided-after-defeat-in-mcd-polls/articleshow/58385861.cms","NEW DELHI: Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra on Wednesday joined several AAP members in calling for introspection over the party's rout in the MCD polls, saying the loss cannot be blamed only on EVMs even as the party leadership alleged ""rigging"" of voting machines.
  

  

  ""This is the time to introspect why we had to see this day after two years. Whether it a Modi wave or not, it has become clear that people have not voted for us. Today's reality is we have got very few seats in comparison to the massive mandate we got in 2015. The results cannot be viewed only by blaming the EVMs,"" Mishra said.
  

  

  He also admitted that looking at poll results, a ""BJP wave"" exists in Delhi.
  

  

  Interestingly, senior AAP leader and Labour Minister Gopal Rai had said there is ""no Modi wave"", but an ""EVM wave,"" alleging tampering of electronic voting machines.
  

  

  Several volunteers, the backbone of the party, are also refusing to buy the claims made by the leadership.
  

  

  An MLA from Central Delhi echoed the minister's sentiments.
  

  

  ""The reasons are shocking as we did not expect to do so badly. Although the party blames EVMs for the defeat and we need to look into the reasons behind the loss, my view is different. But I shall toe the party line on this,"" the MLA said.
  

  

  In Punjab, party MP Bhagwant Mann said there was no use in finding fault with EVMs and the party should introspect on the reasons behind its defeat in the recent Assembly polls.
  

  

  He also slammed the leadership for ""behaving like a 'mohalla' (local) cricket team,"" and said AAP had committed a ""historic blunder"" in Punjab with regard to the overall electoral strategy.
  

  

  AAP Punjab state convener Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi also endorsed Mann's remarks.

  After the party won only 20 seats in Punjab, Kejriwal had alleged tampering of EVMs in the polls.
  

  

  Reacting to Mann's position on EVMs, Delhi deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the party would introspect on reasons behind its defeat, but that it does not mean EVMs were not tampered with.
  

  

  ""Looking at the situation, it seems that there is an EVM wave in Delhi,"" Sisodia said.
  

  

  ""There is no reason why people should vote for the BJP (in the MCD polls). We will analyse the reasons behind our defeat. We would have understood had there been a difference of 2-4 seats, but the margin between the two parties can only happen by rigging the EVMs,"" Sisodia said."

With AAP's attempt to position Gupta as the alternative to Kejriwal in posters failing to click, the move seems to have backfired.

  AAP managed 27 seats then and formed the government with Congress support. This time, the ploy did not work even as Gupta protested that the posters depicted a ""distorted"" grumpy visage.

Its promise to provide cheaper water and electricity, besides other factors, had led to a landslide victory in assembly elections just two years ago.

""We lost because people did not vote for us,"" he said.
  

  

  ""This is our sixth defeat because we were disconnected with volunteers,"" Vishwas said while apologising to the party volunteers for going against their wishes. He also cautioned the party against taking decisions behind closed doors, which volunteers could not defend on the ground.
  

  

  ""There was a big gap in AAP's communication due to which the party was unable to convey what the Delhi government did for the people. Another reason could be that people were angry with us on some issues,"" he said. ""BJP was able to communicate its message to the people and we were a unable to counter that.""
  

  

  Admitting that ""there are short-comings"" in EVMs, Vishwas said this issue could be taken up at appropriate forums such as the election commission and the court. But AAP, he said, needs to think what was the aim of the fight that started from Jantar Mantar. ""Corruption, Congress, Modi or EVM...the short-comings in EVMs is one part of it."" The party's top brass has lost the connect with grassroots workers and the party needs an overhaul, said Vishwas, who has been with AAP since its inception in 2012.
  

  

  Vishwas's remarks are significant considering that chief minister and AAP's national convener Arvind Kejriwal had been blaming ""faulty"" EVMs since the party's disappointing performance in the assembly elections in Goa and Punjab. He had even threatened to launch an agitation over alleged manipulation of EVMs.

  On April 7, the social activist had said the Delhi chief minister had violated laws and the Constitution, and declared he would never support what the AAP leader has done.
  

  

  ""He (Kejriwal) has dashed all my hopes,"" PTI had quoted Hazare as saying, while reacting to
  the Shunglu committee report+
  which indicted the Kejriwal's government for bypassing law, nepotism and financial irregularities.
  

  

  ""I am pained by the Shunglu committee report because Arvind was with me in the fight against corruption. I had great hopes from the young and educated Kejriwal and felt that young people like him will create a corruption-free nation,"" Hazare said in a statement issued at his village Ralegan Siddhi in Ahmednagar district.
  

  

  ""But he has dashed all my hopes,"" Hazare said, adding he was pained to read about the allegations against Kejriwal in the Shunglu Committee report.
  

  

  ""He was my colleague in the fight against corruption. Then, I felt the educated, new generation could help rid the country of graft. But it was a big dream and it lies shattered,"" Hazare said.

  ""When Kejriwal launched the Aam Aadmi Party, it was the Lord who gave me wisdom to keep away (from him) or even my reputation would be ruined,"" Hazare said.
  

  

  ""Even after he became the chief minister, I never felt a desire to meet him. Now, I understand why he always used to address me as his 'Guru'. The Lord has saved me,"" the 79-year-old said.
  

  

  Kejriwal has forgotten all principles in the pursuit of power, Hazare said.

"BJP’s plan: Cleaning mess, mosquitoes","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/bjps-plan-cleaning-mess-mosquitoes/articleshow/58408080.cms","NEW DELHI: After its unexpectedly massive victory in the municipal polls, BJP says that its main focus in the first few months will be on sanitation and public health. In the three municipal corporations, the party plans a slew of measures to prevent the outbreak of diseases and to streamline the city's solid-waste management system.
  

  

  A day after the triumph, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said, ""Our main aim is to make Delhi a clean and healthy city. To achieve this, we will start work on making Delhi garbage-free. We will also pay attention to preventing dengue and chikungunya outbreaks.""
  

  

  However, the biggest challenge for the ruling party in the corporations would be to innovate their way out of the financial morass that the civic bodies constantly are trapped in. Tiwari said that the corporations will ask the state government to immediately release the ""pending amount of Rs 6,200 crore"". ""Delhi CM tweeted that he would work with corporations for the betterment of Delhi,"" pointed out Tiwari. ""If he calls a meeting, we can tell him about the problems the corporations are facing.

  Tiwari will hold meetings with the 181 councillors as well as the BJP members of the outgoing corporations and senior party leaders to prepare a plan for streamlining the functioning of the three municipal bodies. BJP will also organise a two-day training session for the freshly elected councillors, all of whom are new to the post, on how the municipal bodies function.
  

  

  Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who is also the head of the party's national good governance cell, said that the training programme would aim at equipping the newly elected members of the corporations with information about both municipal issues and the party ideology. ""We will educate them about the Municipal Act, the rules and regulations of the House, their functioning, etc,"" said Sahasrabuddhe.
  

  

  Senior party members added that the outgoing councillors, especially those who held important positions in the corporations in the past decade, will be roped in to aid or mentor the new councillors. ""There are several issues that need to be addressed or taken up with the Delhi government. It is important that the new corporators are acquainted with these topics, especially those related to funding such as the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission's recommendation,"" said Virendra Sachdeva, member of BJP's good governance cell.
  

  

  As for instructing the new councillors on the party and its ideology, Sahasrabuddhe said, ""We have a structured learning process in which we tell them about the party's ideology, enhance their awareness about subjects like the environment and help them evolve skills that could help them in day-to-day work as councillors."""

But there is nothing uniform about the choices it made in the civic elections.
  

  

  BJP candidate Deepak Jain won in Sangam Vihar E, defeating the AAP candidate by a mere 812 votes. In Sangam Vihar C, on the other hand, AAP won, defeating the BJP candidate by a margin of 6468 votes. Interestingly, in Sangam Vihar A, people chose an independent over AAP and BJP. He won by a margin of 519 votes over the BJP candidate. This captures the dilemma of the Delhi voter even in areas with similar profiles. So, while AAP won in the illegal colony of Tigri, it was rejected by people in Jaitpur where BJP emerged victorious.
  

  

  And going by voting trends, BJP has won in areas where AAP and Congress were hoping to gain the confidence of voters. There was 55% voting in rural and backward areas.

  In Sarita Vihar's middle and upper middle class areas, people voted back sitting councillor Neetu of Congress. In the middle class colony of Malviya Nagar, the BJP candidate defeated AAP with Vasant Kunj also choosing BJP but the runner-up here was Congress. However, not too far from Malviya Nagar, in the urban village of Chirag Dilli, a mixed population voted AAP to power, with BJP ending in the second place. In RK Puram and GK, BJP won, pushing AAP to the second place.
  

  

  While the middle class of Kalkaji ward voted for BJP, rejecting sitting Congress councilor Virender Kasana, in Govindpuri they chose Congress over BJP. Govindpuri slums were the last location where CM Arvind Kejriwal held his roadshow before the closing of campaign.
  

  

  Congress won three seats out of 64 in the east. These were from areas which have a mix of unauthorised colonies and slums, where AAP was expected to win. Mustafabad ward had a Congress councillor, Parveen, who defeated AAP's candidate, Shakila Begum, with a margin of over 4,000 votes. Congress candidate Rinku defeated BJP candidate Bharat Lal with a margin of 1,300 votes in Nand Nagri ward. While east has a majority of unauthorised and resettlement colonies, AAP secured 11 seats while 47 seats went to BJP and two to BSP.
  

  

  Similarly, in north corporation area, Burari that has many unauthorised colonies voted for BJP candidate Anil Kumar Tyagi, defeating AAP candidate Asit Kumar by a margin of 2,800 votes. Bawana too chose BJP candidate Braham Prakash over AAP and Congress candidates by a margin of almost 3,000 votes."

  scored a hat-trick+
  in the Delhi civic polls as it comfortably retained control of the three municipal corporations, dealing a
  severe blow to the AAP+
  and dashing the Congress' hope of a revival.
  

  

  Winning 181 out of 270 wards where elections were held, the saffron party added muscle to its decade-long domination of the corporations effortlessly bucking anti-incumbency by riding on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
  

  

  The BJP's corporation-wise tally is: SDMC - 70, NDMC - 64 and EDMC - 47 as against AAP's tally of 16, 21 and 11 respectively. Congress finished last with 12, 15 and 3 wards.
  

  

  The BJP had won 138 wards in the last election.
  

  

  

  

  
  

  

  

  Modi expressed his gratitude+
  to the people of Delhi for reposing faith in the BJP and ensuring its resounding victory in the polls.
  

  

  
  ""I laud the hardwork of team @BJP4Delhi which made the resounding MCD win possible,"" he tweeted.
  

  

  In his first reaction, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised all cooperation to the civic bodies and refrained from commenting on EVMs, the alleged ""manipulation"" of which has been identified by him as the reason behind AAP's string of poll upsets.
  

  

  ""I congratulate BJP on their victory in all 3 MCDs. My govt looks forward to working wid MCDs for the betterment of Delhi (sic),"" Kejriwal, who went into a huddle with top leaders of the AAP as the results trickled in early in the day, tweeted.

  The victory is especially sweet for the BJP as it comes two years after it suffered a shock defeat in the Delhi assembly polls where a near-absolute majority had catapulted the AAP to the national stage.
  

  

  For the AAP, the rout comes after successive jolts in Punjab and Goa assembly polls and the Rajouri Garden assembly bypoll here and has led to murmurs of discontent in the party becoming louder.

  The opposition called it a ""referendum"" on the Kejriwal government and demanded that the CM resign.

  The director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Sanjay Kumar, believed that AAP's defeat would ""reduce its chances of survival"" as a political party.
  

  

  ""If you see AAP's report card in terms of state governance, the score isn't really bad. But the Modi wave helped the BJP garner more votes and register a historic win,"" he told PTI.
  

  

  ""Parties contest elections all the time; they win and they lose as well, it should not be too worrisome for them. But AAP's case is different,"" he said, referring to the fact that the party was formed barely four years ago on the strength of popular support.
  

  

  Kumar also said that since the poll results could not be seen as a ""referendum of AAP's work in governance at the state level"", the party needed to look into the reasons for defeat instead of blaming electronic voting machines (EVMs) for it.
  

  

  ""AAP must accept its defeat and go to the people to understand the reasons,"" he said.
  

  

  Kumar said the Delhi MCD elections were important for the three main political parties in the fray for different reasons.
  

  

  For the BJP, a victory would mark its return to the national capital. For the AAP, more seats would have ensured its political survival, while for the Congress, it would have meant a revival, he said.
  

  

  Kumar Rajesh, Fellow at Delhi University's Developing Countries Research Centre (DCRC), described AAP's slide as ""steep"" but predictable.
  

  

  ""While they entered Delhi's political scene with a bang the slide for AAP has been steep,"" he said.

  He added that the DCRC had conducted a survey in all the 272 wards of the MCD, interviewing nearly 40000 people for their views.
  

  

  ""The burst of the political bubble was predictable,"" he said. ""We can't deny that the BJP somehow managed to convince the voters that the party had been working for them,"" he added.
  

  

  The initial results show that the BJP has won 103 seats declared so far, while the AAP and Congress have bagged 26 and 8 seats respectively.
  

  

  The setback for AAP comes after its defeat in the Goa and Punjab assembly elections in March."
"A Purabia who dons many hats and leaves his mark","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/a-purabia-who-dons-many-hats-and-leaves-his-mark/articleshow/58389218.cms","NEW DELHIi: As he applauded his party's landslide in the Delhi municipal polls, BJP chief Amit Shah specifically mentioned Manoj Tiwari, the Bhojpuri singer-actor and member of Lok Sabha from Delhi northwest constituency.
  

  

  Shah must be feeling vindicated since it was he who, defying resistance and misgivings, picked Tiwari to lead the Delhi unit when it was reeling from the humiliation of 2015.
  

  

  Tiwari did not let Shah down. Though the first Bihari to head a unit dominated by Punjabis and Vaishyas and, on top of that, a late entrant to BJP, Tiwari plunged into the job with great gusto, coming up with populist moves like spending nights in slums as part of his effort to connect with a constituency which had powered AAP's rise.
  

  

  He was easily the most sought-after campaigner, addressing 243 meetings.
  

  

  He composed and gave his voice to the party's theme song ""Bhajpa dil mein, dil mein, bhajpa Dilli mein"" for the MCD polls. For someone who contested and lost the 2009 Lok Sabha elections on a Samajwadi Party ticket from Gorakhpur against UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Tiwari has indeed come a long way and his confidence showed through in the presser he held after the result.
  

  

  He made no bones about his identity of being a 'Purabia', a Bihari to be precise, as he chose to address the media in Bhojpuri, a clear indication that he wants to build upon the gains he has made among a burgeoning constituency which has established itself as an important factor in city politics.

  ""We have only seen negative politics in Delhi that attained a new low in the last two and a half years. Our first priority was to develop an atmosphere of positivity and we are grateful to the people of Delhi for responding to our call,"" Tiwari said.
  

  

  Being an acclaimed Bhojpuri singer with several hits like ""Jiya ho Bihar ke Lala"", ""Assiye se BA kaike, babua hamaar"" and also a popular actor in dozens of Bhojpuri films, Tiwari was chosen by the party top brass, a decision laced with the possibility of resentment among local leaders.
  

  

  Originally a resident of Atarwali village in Kaimur district of Bihar, Tiwari was one of the most sought after campaigners in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and also the recent assembly polls in UP and Uttarakhand thanks to his popularity as a singer and actor and also as a mature speaker.
  

  

  He had won the Lok Sabha polls just after joining the BJP and passing the baton to him had created much heartburn. However, Tiwari has successfully silenced his critics by the good show."
"AAP nursery stands by party","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/aap-nursery-stands-by-party/articleshow/58389274.cms","NEW DELHI: Barely five feet tall, 31-year-old Vimlesh Koli is invisible at the centre of a joyous, raucous procession of AAP workers. ""Jhaduwale chha gaye"", they shout into the narrow lanes of Sunder Nagri in northeast Delhi. Her victory in the municipal election is some solace for the Aam Aadmi Party, which has been trounced by BJP in all three municipal corporations.
  

  

  Sunder Nagri is part of AAP's origin myth. This is where Arvind Kejriwal began his NGO Parivartan, did his high-visibility social audits and campaigns. Vimlesh Koli and her crew have been part of that movement, and stayed loyal to Kejriwal for two decades now. Born and raised in these slums, she has campaigned for ration cards, against water privatisation, for the inclusion of EWS children in private schools, against the 2013 gang rape that shook Delhi. Her comrades are equally fervent. ""AAP is my junoon (obsession)"", says 60-year-old Habisun Nisha, who also takes part in the procession. ""This is where Kejriwal and Anna Hazare began their fasts,"" she says.
  

  

  An AAP volunteer displays the results of Ward Sunder Nagri 33E, to show the party's emphatic victory over BJP, Congress and AIMIM. Its disappointing show elsewhere in the city doesn't dampen their joy.
  

  

  Gaurav Garg (25), son of former BJP councillor Kamlesh Garg who runs a big cloth shop, reels off his mother's achievements. Sunder Nagri has a significant Muslim population, of 55-60%, but she had goodwill here, he says. ""The main road has been made pucca, there's end-to-end closed drainage. Around 25 parks have been named, Hanuman Vatika, Abdul Kalam Vatika, Valmiki Vatika and so on. A couple of schools have been made into proper buildings. Three months ago, a ward office was set up for better coordination of services.""
  

  

  Nearly everyone here complains about how dirty the place is. ""Cleanliness depends on the public,"" says Garg. Even if the sanitation worker comes here, by mid-morning it is dirty, because people throw their peels and packets on the street. ""People here are largely illiterate,"" he says. Now that the seat is reserved for SCs and for a woman candidate, ""prabuddha log"" (enlightened people) could not emerge here, he claims.
  

  

  Meanwhile, the slums are still squalid, and many residents have their grouses against AAP. ""They worked best in that first 49-day government. They have slacked off since,"" says Pooran Singh. He is unemployed, though he wanted to be an engineer. He is not particularly inclined towards any party and despises politicians, but is willing to be proved wrong.
  

  

  ""We're not happy at all with AAP. She (Koli) might turn out okay, but the CM has just taken us for a ride,"" says Santoshi (who doesn't use a last name). She waves an electricity bill that she claims is double of what it used to be. Water has always been free here, that's no credit to AAP, she says. What she would like to see is a BJP government along the lines of Yogi Adityanath's in UP.
  

  

  Sunder Nagri is struggling for basic amenities, but identity issues are clearly simmering. Some, who favour BJP, even blame AAP for municipal matters, it had no control over, pointing to the open drains and the clouds of flies. ""We need development,"" says a local. Phool Singh (24) says that AAP should have installed the CCTV cameras it promised since women here often face harassment.
  

  

  Much of AAP's big talk about mohalla clinics and swanky schools has not materialised here. While schools have slowly improved over the years, nearly everyone complains about the public health centre and the nearby GTB hospital.

  Saligram, 70, is a BJP voter, but he's happy the AAP has won because he's started getting a pension of Rs 2,000. Municipal elections are about local issues, about the candidate's own appeal, community and all that. It's not about the party, like a Vidhan Sabha election is, he says.
  

  

  Even his defenders say that AAP's promises haven't panned out . ""Uske pair jame nahin hain. He (Kejriwal) will work when he is fully settled, but BJP doesn't let him work,"" says Zamruddin Ansari, a wage labourer who says he has been in dire straits since the demonetisation decision. Others, like 50-year-old Mohammed Shabir, applaud him for having the ""jigra"" (courage) to speak truth to Modi.

  Meanwhile in adjoining New Seemapuri, AAP's winning candidate Mohini, was a longtime Congress face. People voted for her, not AAP, they say. ""These colonies were settled by Indira Gandhi after the 71 war,"" says a Congress worker. It can still be wrested back, if the party chooses the right candidate who cares about the constituency, he claimed.
  

  

  In other words, there is a committed core of AAP loyalists in Sunder Nagri and surrounding areas. But there is also a clear, hot current that favours BJP, even in the slums, and the non-BJP vote will go wherever it is likely to matter most. Young Vimlesh Koli has a lot riding on her shoulders."

Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav's Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat is in focus in this coming phase.
  

  

  Assembly segments of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency of firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, and Mau, where jailed gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari is in fray, also figure in this sixth and penultimate phase of polling.
  

  

  The campaigning saw BJP state president KP Maurya likening rivals SP, Congress and BSP to different types of venomous ""snakes"" and ""social cancer"" and urging people to eliminate them by voting for the BJP.

With 49 and 40 seats in the two phases remaining, these might be the smallest polling days in the month-long calendar, but given how this part of UP has swung hard one way and then the other in the last few elections, no party would be treating it as less important than some of the larger phases.
  

  

  BSP, in particular, has reason to hope it can put up a better show than in some of the other parts of the state, especially central UP. Not only did the party do
  

  

  extremely well in this part in 2007 and hold its own in 2012, the meltdown it faced in 2014 did not quite have the same impact in the area that polls on Saturday. In these 49 seats, the BSP had a slightly higher vote share than the SP in 2014 though it did not lead in a single segment whereas the SP led in fi ve — thanks to the presence of Mulayam Singh himself in the fray from Azamgarh. With Mulayam no longer a contestant here and with BSP having added to its heft by taking on board bahubali Mukhtar Ansari, Mayawati would hope that her party can position itself as the real challenger to BJP, particularly among Muslims.
  

  

  The strategy, of course, carries with it signifi cant risk, that of triggering a counter polarisation among Hindus. That is what the BJP would be hoping will happen. In 2012, SP had won 27 of these 49 seats and the BSP just 9, but in 2014, the BSP fi nished second to the BJP in 24 seats against just 13 for the SP.
  

  

  Even accounting for the fi ve seats in which SP led thanks to Mulayam, it made the BSP the main contender to the BJP here. The saffron party swept, winning 43 of the 49 seats.
  

  

  The Congress presence both in 2012 and 2014 was really marginal with vote shares of 9.1% and 6.3% respectively. In fact, in 2014, the party led in just one assembly segment despite a sitting Union minister, RPN Singh, contesting from Kushi Nagar constituency.
  

  

  In 2012, smaller outfi ts like the Qaumi Ekta Dal of Ansari had cornered a sizeable chunk of votes with ""others and Independents"" getting nearly 22%.
  

  

  That scenario is unlikely to be repeated now and the party that best consolidates these scattered voters might well have the edge."

Modi adopted this village in November 2014. It's an entirely exclusively Hindu village without any Muslims.
  
  

  

  Party president Amit Shah is already stationed here. All senior ministers who are camping here are going to nearby constituencies to address rallies and are coming back to the city.
  

  

  Ministers like Manoj Sinha and Anupriya Patel, on the other hand, are focussing on their respective areas of influence -Ghazipur and Mirzapur--to woo the voters.Apart from these ministers, party stalwarts like Yogi Adityanath, state chief Keshav Maurya and chief ministers of BJP-ruled states are completing BJP's star parade.
  

  

  Congress, too, has its share of veteran leaders trooping in the city. While UP in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad is reaching on Saturday to take part in the road show, UPCC chief Raj Babbar, former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, PL Punia and Pradeep Mathur have already reached here. While BJP and Congress have flooded the holy city with their big guns, Mayawati will bank on her foot soldiers who will camp in all 40 constituencies going tot he polls in the last phase.
  

  

  ""This is to counter the massive electoral campaign blitzkrieg launched by the BJP brass in the last phase where some of the important constituencies, including Varanasi, are at stake,"" said a senior BSP leader on the condition of anonymity. The cadre will be in close coordination with Mayawati's close aides like RS MP SC Mishra, MLC Naseemuddin Siddiqui, MP Siddharth Ashok, MP Munquad Ali and MLA Indrajeet Saroj. ""We are in constant touch with the party leaders to see that no area is left untouched,"" said BSP functionary Arun Dwivedi.
  

  

  BSP sources said the cadre, comprising Muslim leaders and those from the upper caste, will work in the 10 reserved constituencies where BSP has been performing poorly . In 2012, out of the 10 reserved seats, BSP could win only two, while seven were won by SP and one by an Independent candidate."

Poll analysts say jittery over their success in the eastern part of the state, parties are rallying behind small castes and community-based outfits for support.
  

  

  Even BSP supremo Mayawati, who had earlier said that her party would contest the elections alone, did go back on her words to tie-up with mafia-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari's Quami Ekta Dal (QED). She also got support from the Rashtriya Ulema Council (RUC). As both QED and RUC have influence in Muslim-dominated constituencies, the alliances will help Mayawati strengthen her Dalit-Muslim combination in many seats. In fact, the BSP chief even agreed to give tickets to Ansari as well his as brother and his son on seats of their choice, replacing candidates announced earlier.

  Meanwhile, BJP is betting on Hindu consolidation to woo non-Yadav backward classes and non-Jatav Dalits. It has allied with Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP), which holds considerable influence over the Rajbhar community, which is a most-backward class, and Kurmi-dominated Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction.
  

  

  Analysts said at present, apart from state president Keshav Maurya, the saffron party doesn't have any backward class leaders with state-wide appeal. Hence, apart from forming alliances with caste-based parties, it has also given tickets to backward class leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya, who have defected from other parties.

  Incidentally, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbahr, AD (S) founder late Sonelal Patel and Swami Prasad Maurya were former BSP leaders. Further, BJP had been opposing Mukhtar Ansari for long to mobilise Hindus, but instead of fielding its own candidate against him, it has given the seat to SBSP, given the Rajbhar community's strong presence in the constituency.
  

  

  Desperate to repeat its performance in the 2012 assembly elections, SP has tied up with Congress just before the elections in a bid to sway Muslim voters in the region. The two parties have claimed that the alliance was necessary to stop communal forces like BJP coming to power in the state. They also have the support of Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janta Dal and Janta Dal (United). RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav is campaigning for the alliance, trying to influence voters in constituencies bordering Bihar."

The border villages have been left divided between two states, UP and Bihar. The same village has half population voting in UP and remaining in Bihar.
  

  

  At a paan-kiosk in Dibni Banjarwan, discussion is full on on who would win elections this time. The most voluble of the folks, Rajan Singh, says the sitting MLA would win again. ""The candidate is the most visible and accessible,"" he said. But as soon as one asks him about his family's pick, he is prompt enough to say that he is not a voter in this part of Dibni.
  

  

  The part of Dibni where Singh and his family lives now lies in Bihar. ""But i have never stopped coming here for a paan. It's less than a kilometer away from my place,"" he added. Ganguamathia otherwise a nondescript village has a striking geography. The village which extended till the Bihar border, and was entirely in UP, now has lost few tolas to the neighbouring state. The village has its `haat' on the road running through the mid. Interestingly, the village market, too, is divided. While one side of the haat is in UP, the other is in Bihar.
  

  

  ""I come here every week to buy veggies. I buy from shops on both sides of the road,"" said a local, Prabha Shankar. ""We never think in terms of border. Even local officers would not know at which point in the village the limit of UP ends and that of Bihar begins,"" said former Pradhan of Tirojahan gram sabha, Ravindra Prasad Gupta. In terms of development, the two parts of the village, however, are a look-alike.
  

  

  People like Kewal, a college drop-out and ardent carrom player, goes almost everyday to his uncle's place living on the other side of the border, at times for reason as simple as charging his mobile when his village gets power cut. Children cross border to go to schools and women to do vat-savithri puja. ""Banyan they worship lies on the other side of the village,"" said an elderly in Dibni, Madhav Prasad.
  

  

  The Narayani river along the UP-Bihar border has been cutting into villages since 1984. Every year, 100 to 200 metre of land in villages at the border is getting cut off. ""Many who used to plough the land till ten years back in the area are now landless. Their land got submerged. While Narayani continues to be furious, state governments have hardly acted. ""Be it whichever party, none has addressed the plight of locals,"" added Gupta.
  

  

  Pipraghat is another village which shares the fate of the two villages mentioned above. Locals share Pipraghat used to be a big village touching the Uttar Pradesh's border with Bihar. But surging river has reduced it in size. ""At least 25% people in the village go to Bihar side everyday to till their lands,"" says villager Pramod Singh.
  

  

  Mairwa and Chhapra-Hirauli are affected too. Though the divided villages have separate polling booths, it also leads to hanky-panky in voting, at times. ""There are lot of people who vote in Gram panchayat elections on both sides,"" said local Himmat Yadav. Some people have built a house on Bihar side as well. They move to the other state when river surges on UP side.
  

  

  Then, there are also people taking pension from both the states. ""Good that ration card is now getting linked to Aadhar. Pension fraud got checked to some extent here,"" he adds.
  

  

  Some of the cut-out portions of the UP villages have got new names in Bihar and have become revenue villages, confusion still prevails at some places. A police outpost, milestone on the road and landmarks set by locals in these villages show which side of the village it is."

  While SP-Congress faces the challenge to repeat its performance in 2012 assembly polls when it won 31 of these seats, BJP is hoping for a Hindu consolidation to wrest control of the region where its firebrand Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath holds sway in many seats. BSP chief Mayawati is hoping that her strategy of dalit-Muslim political engineering outsmarts the rivals.
  

  

  Known as badlands of eastern UP where making distinction between politicians and bahubalis is difficult, the region has substantial number of Muslims, Brahmins, dalits and most backward classes (MBCs), while Yadavs and Bhumihars hold sway in some pockets.
  

  

  The seven agriculturally rich but backward districts covered in the sixth phase are Maharajganj, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Deoria, Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia.

  In 2012, SP won 27, Congress 4, BSP 9 and BJP 7 constituencies, while Qaumi Ekta Dal (QED) and Nationalist Congress Party got one seat each. owever, BJP dominated H the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and was ahead in 42 as sembly segments. SP led in just 6 assembly seats, including five in Azamgarh, and Congress one. The BSP is contesting on all 49 seats, BJP on 45 and its ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) on four, SP on 40 and Congress on 10. SP and Congress are engaged in a ""friendly fight"" in Khajani (SC) seat in Gorakhpur.
  

  

  Besides polarization of Hindu votes, BJP is banking on its allies, SPBP and Apna Dal. On the other hand, to sway Muslims, Mayawati has placed her bet on Ansari brothers' QED and Rashtriya Ulema Council (RUC). QED merged with BSP just before campaigning while RUC withdrew its candidates and announced support to Mayawati. SP-Congress alliance is hoping that Akhilesh government's achievements would give it an edge in the contest.

Behind bars in Mumbai, his family realised they'd have to cough up Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh for a bail bond. Making security arrangements would be way too complicated. So, they dropped the idea.
  

  

  Salem might have missed the bus, but not the thousands who've arrived from cities like Mumbai and from as far as West Asia, to vote on Saturday. Take Abdul Hamza, 24. A construction firm manager in Thane, he chats with friends at an Azamgarh restaurant owned by Salem's brother Hakim and nephew Arif.
  

  

  As Hamza and friends wait for their meal, his mobile phone rings — the tune from the Bollywood hit Once Upon A Time in Mumbai. It revives memories of Salem, his notorious gangland life and alleged role in the 1992 Mumbai blasts.
  

  

  Mumtaz Ahmad, who is with Hamza, runs a Unani clinic in Andheri, Mumbai. He, too, is in his hometown to vote. In 1991, his father convinced him to leave the town for a career. The D-Company was hiring Azamgarh youngsters as sharpshooters and he didn't want Mumtaz to get into trouble.
  

  

  Hakim avoids discussing Salem much, only says: ""Well, things did not work out. He (Salem) couldn't come. But we are happy so many from here are eager to do their bit for the city. We have produced greats like Kaifi Azmi and Shabana Azmi and entrepreneurphilanthropist Frank Islam.""
  

  

  In the 1980s and '90s, thousands from Azamgarh went to Mumbai lured by dreams of making money in the ancillary businesses around Bollywood.
  

  

  Also at the restaurant is Mohd Rashid, 41. He's a Dubai cloth merchant, wears jazzy shades and copies Amitabh Bachhan in Don. He insists Azamgarh got a bad name only because of some men.
  

  

  ""Before reaching here last week, I bought gamchhas worth Rs 4 lakh as gifts and distributed them to people here. I urged them to vote for whichever party they want. Azamgarh must rid itself of its chequered past,"" he says.

Nizamabad is home to exquisite black pottery with intricate silver inlay work that enjoys a geographical indication status. In the town's bylanes about 70 potter families live, every man, woman and child is at a potter's wheel — moulding, etching, polishing or scraping the surface of a clay artefact.
  

  

  Despite mastery of their craft, they still live in huts. ""There is no institutional support to this art form. Artists are giving up on black pottery; work on the saleable designs in clay,"" says Mayank Prasad Prajapati, as he shapes diyas for an order from Mumbai.
  

  

  As politicos hunt for votes, the Prajapatis of Nizamabad are a forgotten lot. ""Just four families continue in this trade: it is tough and the material costs have gone up. Despite the much-hyped GI tag to Nizamabad black pottery, we get no support to export or any government help to push sales,"" he added. The prajapatis, originally from Gujarat's Kutch, are a backward class artisan community who settled in Nizamabad during Aurangzeb's rule. They mostly vote for BJP.

  Pt Ajay Mishra, who lives in Mumbai but frequents his home in Hariharpur says the Mishras settled in Hariharpur as court performers of Azam Fateh Khan of Azamgarh almost 600 years ago. Says Mishra: ""Hariharpur suffers on two accounts. One, the village is in Azamgarh that's tagged as being a hotbed of radical activities, and two, netas do not promote the region's music that can restore the area's image of its rich heritage.""
  

  

  The orthodox Mishras try to keep their tradition and spirits from fl agging. Even today the women stay indoors, but boys as young as 6 and 10 years old accompany music troops to perform at state and national levels. Suraj Mishra, 19, a tabla player of the Hariharpur gharana, says, ""A group of us won the gold at the Indian Youth Festival in Haryana. Not so much as a murmur on our return. But the DM won a gold in some event and media cobered it for three days!"" says the crestfallen teenager.

  ""The land of Azamgarh has always backed Samajwadis. While you all gave honour to Netaji (Mulayam), you also gave support to Akhilesh bhaiya. Now, I am sure that you would stand behind me and help us win. Only then we can cross the 300 target,"" she added.

The region touches the forested terai at the Himalaya foothills in the north extending southward braided with rivers Rapti, Tamsa and Ghagra. Its population density averages 1,165 persons per square kilometre, the highest in the state. But this density is not from urbanisation that's only 11%. It's an ancient land, always with large populations of cultivators and traditional industries, but now straining under the burden.
  

  

  Small-holding agriculture — wheat, paddy, pulses, and sugarcane the main produce — dominates the local economy.
  

  

  Average land holding size is just 0.55 hectares. Across Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia districts, dying embers of traditional industry including weaving and garment manufacture, wooden artifacts, black pottery are visible. Gorakhpur remains a hub for trade in hides and leather, but a pale shadow of its past. Mau became a boom town after the power loom was introduced in the 1970s as it competed with Varanasi in making saris. But it's now reduced to mostly family-based handloom or powerloom units.

  In Palki cluster, there are 21,000 such units registered but they employ just 40,000 workers — about two workers apiece. Mostly out contracted by traders, locals are involved in home-based and micro level work across the region. The pitifully lowpaying work ranges from bidi-making to bindi-making in Deoria, or wooden furniture in Ballia. Small agro-processing units are in abundance, fed by the surrounding sown fi elds. As a result, though the region has about 10% of the state's enterprises, only about 4.5% of the state's workers are employed here, indicating how tiny these enterprises are.
  

  

  Stagnation has left the region with a per capita income a third lower than the state average. District level income fi gures are a revelation: Mau, which boasts of only very small textile enterprises still emerges with a better income than Azamgarh or Ballia, and of course, much better than pure farm economies as in Kushi Nagar or Maharajganj in the north.
  

  

  One deadly feature of the region that highlights the extreme neglect by successive governments is the annual toll from encephalitis.
  

  

  Spread by mosquitoes, which thrive in this heavy rainfall region dotted with lakes and ponds, over 4,000 people, mostly children, have died of this disease in the past six years. There is only one place to go to for 'brain fever' as it is called: the Baba Raghav Das Hospital at Gorakhpur. Though of late it's been given equipment and personnel, it is woefully short."
"BJP, BSP look to dent SP's prospects in Azamgarh-Mau","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-bsp-look-to-dent-sps-prospects-in-azamgarh-mau/articleshow/57450507.cms","AZAMGARH: Rivals BJP and BSP are looking to make serious dents in the Samajwadi Party bastion of Azamgarh by sewing up strong social alliances to trump the formidable Muslim-Yadav coalition.
  

  

  The Mayawati-led BSP is receiving traction among a section of Muslims with the backing of Rashtriya Ulama Council, which was formed to rally Muslims against the Batla House encounter, and the merger of history-sheeter Mukhtar Ansari's party with it.
  

  

  If the BSP hopes to upstage the SP by garnering a big chunk of traditional Samajwadi supporters, the BJP expects to walk with non-Yadav backward castes votes besides its core upper castes to emerge victorious.
  

  

  In 2012, the SP had bagged 11 of the 14 seats in Mau and Azamgarh leaving the BSP and the BJP with two and none respectively.
  

  

  ""Elephants (BSP poll symbol) will tear down this SP fort this time,"" said BSP leader Akal Sahu at the party office, claiming that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's 'kaam bolta hai' slogan has no resonance here due to lack of development.
  

  

  SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav is the Lok Sabha MP from Azamgarh, which stood by the SP while the BJP swept Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 elections.
  

  

  However, it is the BJP that is sensing an opportunity with the split in Muslim votes and its rainbow coalition of various Hindu castes.
  

  

  The saffron BJP flag flutters in the small vegetable shop of Hari Sonkar, who belongs to the Khatik community, a Dalit caste.
  

  

  Though a majority of Dalits are seen to be backing the BSP, Sonkar says only Chamars (Jatav), the dominant Dalit caste numbering more than 50 per cent of the grouping, benefit from its rule and he supports the BJP this time.
  

  

  ""Last time it was the SP, this time it is the BJP for me. Let's give them a chance,"" he said.
  

  

  In this Mehnagar constituency, the BJP is supporting its ally Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party's candidate. The saffron party's alliance with Om Prakash Rajbhar-headed party has helped it win over an important chunk of Rajbhars, an OBC community.
  

  

  If the Samajwadi Party appears to be losing the battle arithmetic, what is helping its cause is the goodwill chief minister Akhilesh Yadav enjoys across the identity divides. It is common to find even avowed BJP and BSP supporters praise him.
  

  

  Ashfaq Ahmad, a teacher, accused the media of deliberately playing up the BSP's pull among the Muslims to undermine the SP, insisting that the community members are solidly behind the youthful chief minister, who is a ""much better administrator"" than his father.
  

  

  ""Muslims are a politically aware community. It will not do anything that helps the BJP. The SP will do well,"" he said. The region is going to poll tomorrow in the sixth phase of the UP assembly elections."
"Gorakhpur’s don now talks about roads he built","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/gorakhpurs-don-now-talks-about-roads-he-built/articleshow/57444387.cms","Gorakhpur: When a young man won in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election in 1985, the country sat up and watched. For, Hari Shankar Tiwari became India's first politician to have won an election while in prison. On Thursday, almost three-and-a-half decades later, he sat in an XUV in a long cavalcade snaking its way among the bright yellow mustard fields in Gagha, about 30 km from Gorakhpur city.
  

  

  The terrain is familiar -- it's here where he not only won six consecutive elections, but his exploits, along with a few more ""bahubalis"" like Virendra Pratap Sahi and later Sriprakash Shukla, earned Gorakhpur - where Tiwari stays - the sobriquet of ""Chicago of the east"" in western media.
  

  

  History sheet number 38 (A) in Gorakhpur lists TADA, NSA and Gangster (Prevention) Act along with murder and abduction against the name of Tiwari, though courts have acquitted him of all charges. Once upon a time in Gorakhpur, back in the 70s and 80s, when gangwars raged on the streets, politicians in east UP sought the support of dons. He was a part of the cabinet in every party in UP - with Kalyan Singh, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati.
  

  

  Now, in the midst of a fiercely-fought election, his son is talking about roads that his father built in his constituency Chillupar, where he is fighting on a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket.
  

  

  ""Is kshetra mein unka prabhav bahut hai (His influence in the constituency is immense),"" says Vinay Tiwari, sitting in his election office in Badhalganj in between campaigning.
  

  

  People bend and touch his touch his feet wherever his cavalcade stops. In a Himachali cap, a long warm coat and sports shoes, Panditji, as he is known in Gorakhpur, begins his day very early. He spends time in his gaushala tending to the cows, a practice he hasn't left for decades, and then begins his campaign for Vinay.
  

  

  Ask him about Yogi Adityanath, BJP MP from Gorakhpur, and Tiwari shoots back: ""Who toh gau-rakshak hai. Main gau-palak hoon. (Yogi is a cow protection vigilante. I care for cows).
  

  

  Yet another word irks him - the mention of ""bahubali"". ""There is not a single case against me. I have had to fight right up to the Supreme Court. I have got acquitted in all of them. Woh sab jhoothe cases thhe. It was vendetta against me. If I were a bahubali, would I have lost elections? The image of me as a don was created by my detractors,"" says Tiwari.
  

  

  His son believes the image of a don may have stuck on his father but the good he has done for his constituency far outweighs the perception. ""He too talks about the over-800 km of roads he has got built in Chillupar. The roads you drove on to reach here were built by him. The BSP candidate here (Rajesh Tripathi, who had defeated Tiwari in 2007 to end his run in the Assembly) did nothing in his last term. Even the ""muktidham"" he built along the Saryu and keeps talking of, is more of a picnic spot where even couples go and romance, robbing it of it sanctity,"" says Vinay.
  

  

  What gets Tiwari's goat is also allegations of ""jaatiwad,"" that he started off a Brahmin-Thakur feud in the region for dominance. And, he would not let go till he has proved his point. The former don looks around, calls people from among the motley crowd waiting in the courtyard. His men get a person out of his bath. ""He is Sanjay Singh, he has been with me for years and he is a Thakur. You will find many Thakurs with me,"" he tells TOI, as he points towards them.
  

  

  While Vinay goes out on another round of campaigning after a quick meeting with BSP workers, Tiwari takes a break in his house in ... A round of tea follows as his men give him updates. He gets upset every time words like don and bahubali crop up, even a tad irritated. ""What can I say about what western media wrote?"" Tiwari snaps when asked about a report in BBC in the 80s that likened Gorakhpur to Chicago. ""A lot of falsehood was spread about me,"" he adds.
  

  

  But asked why this happened since he was part of every government in the state - from BJP to BSP and Samajwadi Party to Congress - Tiwari says: ""Tell me if you find any complaint against me as a part of any of these government. The image of a don was a myth created around my name to defame me.""
  

  

  He gets into his car again, as the cavalcade whisks off for another trail, another familiar road for Tiwari. But, unlike the road that he probably built and took so often, meeting people who voted for him for 30 years through turbulent phases like Mandal and mandir, what Tiwari now faces are winds of change.
  

  

  ""People's temperament has changed. Voters think differently now. They want development,"" he admits as he drives off into the mustard fields, looking for votes for his son."

  The commission removed DM Rajesh Prakash, SDM (Shikohabad) Premchand Yadav and SP Himanshu Kumar and appointed new officials in their place.
  

  

  New DM Neha Sharma, and Ajay Kumar as new SP took their charge on Friday, while Ambareesh Kumar (as new SDM of Shikohabad) is expected to join office in a couple of days.
  

  

  On polling day (February 11), several BJP leaders were allegedly thrashed by SP leaders including zila panchayat president Vijay Pratap Yadav inside the Shikohabad police station in front of cops. Among others, BJP Braj area president Suman Chaturvedi had received injuries.
  

  

  BJP leaders had reportedly gone to the police station to report scuffles between their party workers and those of the SP at several booths. Later in the night, BJP candidates and workers staged protest outside the district collectorate to register their protest against the alleged assault.
  

  

  Senior officials at that time had assured the protesting crowd that appropriate action against the erring cops as well as accused SP leaders would be taken within 24 hours. Subsequently, an FIR was registered against Vijay Pratap Yadav, Surya Dev, Awadesh Yadav and 40 unidentified men of the SP.
  

  

  Along with that, an FIR was also registered against several BJP workers and leaders including Atul Pratap Singh, son of Jaiveer Singh, who is contesting election from Sirsaganj constituency, a day later.
  

  

  Later, another FIR was registered against three BJP candidates and 500 unnamed party workers for staging a protest outside the DM's office on February 11. Those who were named in the FIR were Jaiveer Singh, sitting MLA and candidate from Firozabad Manish Asija, and Shikohabad candidate Mukesh Verma.
  

  

  The BJP had termed the police action a conspiracy and alleged that the bureaucracy was acting on the behest of the ruling party in the state.
  

  

  On February 25, BJP leaders including Jaiveer Singh, Mukesh Verma and Jasrana candidate Ram Gopal alias Pappu Lodhi among others met the chief election commissioner and submitted a 250-page complaint, demanding strict action against the senior officials.
  

  

  Earlier, the EC had removed Firozabad additional police superintendent (rural) Amar Singh, circle officer V K Tiwari and station officer (Sirsaganj) Brijveer Singh on similar complaints."
"Will netas stop the Ballia cheat mafia?","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/will-netas-stop-the-ballia-cheat-mafia/articleshow/57438854.cms","BALLIA: They aren't talking polarisation here, or demonetisation. The PM's graveyard talk fi nds little traction. In east UP, they are discussing something more fundamental: Cheating in exams and the nexus that runs the racket.
  

  

  Narendra Modi brought up the issue at a recent poll rally in Gonda, expressing concern over the future of UP. Ballia and some neighbouring towns are ground zero. The cheating mafi a fl ourish here. Students, also from neighbouring states, eager to dazzle in public exams with no effort, make a beeline for these areas and take the UP board exams. They get in touch with the scamsters, who organise admissions to state-board affi liated institutions and ensure clients get pass certifi cates with divisions of their choice.
  

  

  BJP went after the masterminds of the fraud in 1992 and lost the elections. SP won and immediately scrapped the anti-copying ordinance BJP had promulgated. Recently, responding to Modi's concern, CM Akhilesh Yadav dismissed the issue as not worth losing sleep over. So, Ballia's cheating factory prospers.
  

  

  Every year hundreds of private and non-affi liated colleges apply for examination centre status. Once the approvals come, they conduct high school and intermediate examinations with assorted facilities to enable cheating. There's no political will to end the menace.
  

  

  The UP Secondary Teachers' Association is worried and wants the enrolment and approval system for exam centres to go online. But the UP secondary education department hasn't raised a fi nger to stop the fraudsters. Districts such as Kaushambi, Aligarh, Hardoi, Deoria, Mau, Azamgarh, Bahraich, Gonda, Basti, Shravasti Gorakhpur and Ballia are notorious.
  

  

  R P Mishra, secretary of the teachers' association, says UP has ""over 1 lakh sham private colleges and coaching centres that register Class IX and XI students"". Ballia provides ideal conditions to these fake colleges. Vigilance is lax.
  

  

  This year, the town had 317 high school and intermediate exam centres for 2.20 lakh students. Of these, almost 50% are self-fi nanced. In 2015, government limited the number of such centres in Ballia to 224. But at last count the number stood at 317.
  

  

  Geeta Yadav, a high school teacher here, says, ""The rule is that while allocating exam centres, priority should be given to government and aided colleges. Self-fi nanced institutions should be considered only when no option is left. But the district inspector of schools has been on a spree to increase exam centres, mostly private colleges.""

  Ballia teachers claim that until 2012, every year around 30,000-40,000 students from Punjab, Haryana, Bihar and even Nepal take exams here.
  

  

  The education mafi a mints around Rs 3,500 crore every year, estimates say.
  

  

  SP Singh, former principal secretary, secondary education, UP, now leads a campaign called Nakal Roko Abhiyaan. ""I had black-listed around 255 such fake centres for facilitating cheating.
  

  

  These often hold exams in the open or under tin-sheds, which obviously help copying,"" he said."

  Immigration and all the forces have been alerted to keep an eye out for him.
  

  

  A Letter of Cancellation (LC) will soon be opened against him, which will alert immigration authorities about any possible move by the suspect to leave the country.
  

  

  The Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), guarding Uttar Pradesh's border with Nepal, has also been alerted about the possibility of such a move by Prajapati.
  

  

  Prajapati is accused in separate cases of gangrape and an attempt to rape another
  woman and her minor daughter+
  . He has remained elusive and the Lucknow Police have initiated steps to withdraw his 'Y' category security.
  

  

  Meanwhile, the BJP accused chief minister
  Akhilesh Yadav+
  of hiding Prajapati at his residence and said the chief minister had become a ""patron"" of criminals in the state.
  

  

  ""The chief minister has hidden Gayatri Prajapati at his residence and the police is enacting the drama of carrying out raids to arrest him,"" BJP state unit president Keshav Prasad Maurya claimed.
  

  

  ""Can Akhilesh take a pledge in the name of the mother Ganga that Gayatri has not been kept at the CM's residence ... if the Chief Minister really wants, Prajapati can be caught in ten minutes,"" he said.
  

  

  At a press conference on Friday, Akhilesh denied the charges of harbouring Prajapati and said, ""The matter is in the Supreme Court... The government will fully cooperate and go by its order. Justice will be done.""
  

  

  Acting on the
  Supreme Court's orders+
  , police said they have been making efforts to nab him and they might even apply for cancellation of his passport so that the minister cannot escape from the country.
  

  

  Interestingly though, the minister was seen moving freely from one place to another in his constituency seeking votes.
  

  

  The last time Prajapati was seen in public was on February 27, when he spoke to the media saying he will win with a huge margin and work under Akhilesh Yadav once again."

  Nizamabad is home to the famous black pottery with its intricate silver inlay work. Inside the narrow bylanes of the Nizamabad town, where about 70 potter families live, there is not a single man, woman or child who is not working a potter's wheel, carving, polishing or scraping the surface of a clay artefact that's being readied for sale.
  

  

  Despite the acclaim, though, the houses are still little more than mud huts and thatched roofs or unfinished brick structures, at best. ""There is no institutional support to this art form. So, many artists have given up the traditional black pottery work and started to do the more saleable designs in clay,"" says Mayank Prasad Prajapati, as he shapes Diwali diyas for the large order he has to send to Mumbai.
  

  

  In election season, when leaders are crawling in every street corner, doling out promises and begging for votes, the Prajapatis of Nizamabad are a forgotten lot. ""The black pottery we were famous for has now become restricted to just four families because the work is tough and material costs have gone up. Despite the much-hyped geographical indicator tag to Nizamabad black pottery, we get no support to export our products or any government help to push sales,"" he added.
  

  

  The Prajapatis, originally from Kutch in Gujarat, are backward class artisans who settled in Nizamabad during the Mughal rule of Aurangzeb. The families never returned after the Mughal rule ended, and over the last few decades, they say they have been supporters of the BJP. ""Among the OBCs, the Yadavs vote for the Samajwadi Party, while the Dalits back BSP. Modiji made promises to protect and provide for artisans, as did CM Akhilesh Yadav. But our conditions have gradually worsened. Neither the SP, nor the BJP have delivered on their development promises to us. The tradition of Nizamabad pottery is dying,"" says Anand Prajapati, a sixth generation potter who says their dependence on middlemen for sale, and the wafer-thin profit margins is making the business unviable.
  

  

  About 80km away, Hariharpur, the musical village of Azamgarh, where even month-old babies respond to the notes of 'sargam' before they crawl, 80 Brahmin families work night and day to preserve a rich tradition of folk and classical music. Separated geographically, but not in their sentiments, this lot of artists also have the same grouse; little institutional support to prevent local talent from migrating outside the village.
  

  

  Pandit Ajay Mishra, a performing artist settled in Mumbai, but who frequents home in Hariharpur, says the Mishra community came and settled in Hariharpur as court performers of Raja Azam Fateh Khan of Azamgarh almost 600 years ago. The benevolent raja gave their ancestors land on which to settle and the families have lived here since. "" Hariharpur suffers on two accounts; one because it is in Azamgarh, which suffers because of its image as a hotbed of radical activities, and because the political class does not promote this music activity to overturn this rabid image.""
  

  

  What's also unfortunate is that whoever has left to make it big outside, including artists like Padma awardee Pandit Chhannu Lal Mishra, have rarely looked back to uplift the village. But Ajay Mishra, who maintains his connect, says he and other senior members of the Mishra families are persisting in the hope that someone will amplify to someone who cares to listen, their musical needs.

  Even today, while women in the families stay indoors, boys as young as six and 10 years accompany music troops to perform at state and national levels. Suraj Mishra, 19, a tabla proponent from the Hariharpur gharana, said, ""A group of us went and won the Gold at the Indian Youth Festival in Haryana. When we returned, there wasn't so much as a murmur of acknowledgement. Around the same time, the district magistrate won a gold in some event and there was media coverage of it for three days. We also brought laurels back for our state and village, but there was no acknowledgement.""
  

  

  Mishra refers to Azamgarh DM and IAS officer Suhas LY, a keen shuttler, who won the gold at the 2016 badminton Paralympic championship. But Mishra's reference is only to highlight the governmental apathy at the hands of which the musical tradition of Hariharpur has suffered.
  

  

  Ajay Mishra says he wants to see a day when the children of Hariharpur can remain home and practise music knowing they can make a respectable career of it. ""Artists want respect. Here, the local SP MLA Durga Yadav expects us to be at his beck and call. Yet, when we went to invite CM Akhilesh Yadav to be a chief guest at the Azamgarh festival, Durga Yadav intervened to stop him. Hariharpur suffers because of these local animosities,"" Mishra added.

  The new supporters may make all the difference to the BSP in the 28 constituencies in this region as the party seems to be losing some of its traditional support among the non-Yadav other backward classes (OBCs) or most backward castes (MBCs) such as Rajbhar, Bind and Lonia to the BJP, which looks set to force a triangular contest on most of these seats.
  

  

  The BSP is getting support of local political party Ulema Council in Azamgarh, apart from Ansari brothers, whose areas of influence include Mau, Ballia and Ghazipur.
  

  

  On the other hand, members of MBCs have become vocal supporters of BJP-Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party alliance, which commands support of the Rajbhar voters, who have considerable presence in more than 20 seats of the four districts.
  

  

  In 2012 polls, BSP had lost several seats by a small margin of votes. So, the possible increase in its support base among Muslim voters will come in handy.

In simpler terms, it's a fi ght between Rais and Ansaris, two dominant local families involved in a bitter and bloodsoaked tussle for power.
  

  

  For BJP candidate Alka Rai, the widow of slain BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai, this is a fi ght for ""Bhumihar prestige"". And she is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that BSP's Sibghatullah Ansari, the sitting MLA and brother of mafi a don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, is defeated and sent to jail, which she says ""is his rightful place"".
  

  

  The rivalry, which has drawn blood from both sides, reached its turning point in November 2005, when the then sitting MLA Krishnanand Rai and his six supporters were killed. The ripples of the killing were felt far and wide as the infl uential Bhumihar community, to which the slain Rai belonged, erupted in fury in Ghazipur, Varanasi and other adjoining districts.
  

  

  BJP had staged a fortnightlong protest in Varanasi seeking a CBI inquiry into the case, to which the then SP government fi nally agreed. Mukhtar was convicted for orchestrating the murders and is currently serving a sentence.
  

  

  Years later, Purvanchal is staring at a new electoral calculus with BSP and BJP locked in a straight fi ght. For Alka Rai, the road through Bitthal Bazaar in Yusufpur, which leads to 'Phatak' is still her biggest hurdle. For 'Phatak' is the residence of the Ansari brothers — Mukhtar, Afzal and Sibghatullah — in the Muslim-dominated area.
  

  

  The front room of the house, dotted with portraits of past Ansari leaders, is the nerve centre. ""Our ancestors were freedom fi ghters and martyrs and we are trying to carry on that legacy. We have been vocal about the rights of the poor, who have been suppressed for ages by the upper caste,"" said sitting MLA and the eldest of Ansari brothers, Sibghatullah.
  

  

  While the Ansari brothers have managed to keep a good chunk of Bhumihars on their side against the wishes of many in the community, BJP is banking heavily on Union cabinet minister Manoj Sinha, dubbed a ""guiding"" fi gure for the Bhumihars in this region. A restive Mohammadabad is always on the edge — differences are settled only through bullets. ""The differences are irreconcilable and guns are used with impunity. This has been the history of this region,"" said Mangal Yadav, a local."
"BJP big guns camp in Varanasi for PM Modi's show","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-big-guns-camp-in-varanasi-for-pm-modis-show/articleshow/57441759.cms","NEW DELHI: Having shifted its campaign headquarters for the Uttar Pradesh elections to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, senior BJP leaders and union ministers are now busy preparing the ground for his two rallies, a meeting with intellectuals and other programmes in the area before the last phase of polling on March 8.
  

  

  With its opponents in three assembly seats in Varanasi giving BJP a tough fight, it has become a prestige issue for the party to win them. BJP chief Amit Shah, who was earlier mostly operating with Lucknow as his base, has now shifted to Varanasi. He has been personally involved in strategising and monitoring the day-to-day progress of the campaign not only in Varanasi, but also in the Poorvanchal region that goes to polls in the sixth and seventh phase respectively.
  

  

  While Shah returns to Varanasi after campaigning in different constituencies – he even went to Manipur for a day on Wednesday – health minister JP Nadda has been stationed in Varanasi. BJP Rajya Sabha members Om Mathur and Bhupendra Yadav, BJP secretary (organisation) UP Sunil Bansal and national secretary Srikant Sharma are based in the city.
  

  

  Finance minister Arun Jaitley, power minister Piyush Goel, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad have visited Varanasi. Textile Minister Smriti Irani will be in Varanasi as part of BJP plans of having one union minister hold a press meet everyday.
  

  

  She will address the press at 12 noon. The party is banking heavily on the charisma of Modi to make things better for the BJP in his constituency. That it is a tough battle for BJP can be gauged from the fact that Modi will be holding two public meetings in the district — on March 4 and 5.
  

  

  “The prime minister will arrive in Varanasi after a jan sabha in neighbouring Jaunpur on March 4. He will go for a darshan of Lord Vishwanath and then address a public meeting before returning to Delhi. He will address another public meeting on March 5 and then stay for the night in Varanasi.
  

  

  He will meet intellectuals on March 6, the last day of campaigning, before going back,” a party leader said. While a roadshow of the prime minister had been planned earlier, it has now been dropped. Party leaders cite objections from the Special Protection Group that guards the PM as the reason.
  

  

  Out of the eight assembly seats in Varanasi, Rohaniya and Sevapuri are being contested by NDA partner Apna Dal, while BJP is in the fray in the other six. Of these, the contest is tough in Pindra, Varanasi Cantonment and Varanasi South.
  

  

  Incidentally, all these seats are being fought by the Congress and this had made it more of an ego issue for the BJP, which has done well against the grand old party in almost all elections – local as well as state level – since 2014.Ajay Rai is the Congress sitting MLA in Pindra and is likely to win this time too.
  

  

  Congress has fielded Anil Srivastava from Varanasi Cantt. He stood second the last time, but with Congress-SP in alliance this time, he stands a good chance. There is resentment in the BJP camp here as the ticket has gone to Saurabh Srivastava, whose parents have earlier contested from this seat. BJP workers feel their party leadership is promoting one family on this seat.

  Former Congress MP Rajesh Mishra, who won the Lok Sabha polls in 2004, is contesting from Varanasi South. While he is a strong candidate, what has made matters worse for the BJP is the rebellion by Shyamdeo Roy Chaudhury, the seven-time sitting MLA from this seat.
  

  

  In protest, he has not been campaigning as he was denied a ticket. Dayashankar Mishra, who stood second in 2012 when he contested as a Congress candidate, is now in the BJP. He is said to be sulking as he too was bypassed and Neelkanth Tiwari was given the ticket.
  

  

  Modi will have to assuage the feelings of all these disgruntled elements within the party and take on the challenge posed by the SPCongress alliance in his Lok Sabha constituency."
"Social engineering BJP’s trump card?","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/social-engineering-bjps-trump-card/articleshow/57444927.cms","LUCKNOW: It was the forte of Lalu, Mulayam and Mayawati. But this time in UP, BJP has done some social engineering, working on caste lines as is evident in its selection of candidates and choice of rally spots. The party has set eyes on the huge vote banks—from non-Yadav OBCs to non-Jatav dalits and groups like Sainis and Jats in western UP. The Kalyan Singh formula is in place in a bid to win the mother of all elections.
  

  

  The party won 2014 parliament elections by sweeping, along with its allies, 73 seats out of 80 in the state and now in the Assembly elections, it has not taken chance, especially when it aims to end is 15-year ""vanvaas"" (exile) in the state. BJP is well aware that defeat in UP will hamper its prospects in 2019 polls.
  

  

  So, while on one hand, the party is making bid stoke the communal sentiment by raking up issues like Kasab and 'kabristan-shamshan', it is also experimenting with the Kalyan Singh formula of social engineering by giving adequate representation to OBCs and the MBCs in the ticket distribution along with the upper castes.
  

  

  It was under Kalyan Singh, most powerful face of the BJP from the Lodh backward community in the early 90s, when it first came to power winning 221 out of the 425 UP seats. The Kalyan Singh formula was so strong that despite SP and the BSP coming together in 1993, BJP won 177 seats. Of course, Ram temple issue was also the major factor but the backward vote contributed no less.
  

  

  Kalyan Singh may be the present governor of Rajasthan but in many constituencies where Lodh candidates are contesting, BJP candidates are seeking votes in his name.
  

  

  Even within the BJP and outside, Kalyan Singh is credited with turning the elitist party into a truly democratic one by taking it from urban areas to rural and from being a Brahmin-Bania party to one that represents the weaker and backward castes. No wonder, the party has given tickets to 128 non-Yadav OBCs this time.
  

  

  Having started his political career in 1967 with the Jansangh, it was Kalyan Singh from a economically weaker section of Atrauli village in Aligarh district who toured the state extensively and identified most backwards castes like Prajapati, Shakya, Rajbhar and Kushwaha and gave them positions in the organisation as party's state president and then as chief minister.
  

  

  He also appointed Mastram and Gulabo Devi from the Dhobi caste as ministers in his cabinet. Gorakh Prasad Nishad, Ram Prasad Kamal and Ram Chand Valmiki were other members from the SC castes, placed in the organization and the government.
  

  

  Like SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, who cultivated himself as the undisputed leader of the Yadavs, Kalyan challenged him by uniting Lodhs. It is said that Lodhs have strong presence ranging from 10,000 to 1.25 lakh in 160 constituencies and this election being fought on Kalyan formula, his castemen are likely to support the BJP strongly.
  

  

  In order to expand BJP support among the OBCs , the party has also tied up with SBSP, a party of Rajbhars (OBCs) in the eastern UP while it already has another fledgling outfit - Apna Dal of Kurmis (also OBC) -- as alliance partners. Rajbhars are in sizeable number in several assembly constituencies in eastern Uttar Pradesh.
  

  

  With majority of Brahmins, Rajputs and Banias failing to get much in the 15-year regime of SP and BSP already flocking to the BJP and the Kalyan formula drawing the OBCs, the outcome of the elections will tell whether or not this formula has worked."

  Poll percentage dipped from 64% in the fi rst phase in west UP to 57% in east UP in phase fi ve. This, indicative of a growing indifference of voters towards the election, could disturb calculations of the major parties.

  In the fi rst phase that covered Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Meerut and Ghaziabad districts with large populations of Muslims and Jats, poll percentage was a healthy 64.2%, making it clear that the wounds of the communal riots of 2013 still hurt. Killing of Akhlaq in Gautam Buddh Nagar for consuming and storing meat that was allegedly 'beef' became a pan-India issue in 2015, further deepening the divide.
  

  

  In phase two, mostly in Rohilkhand comprising Bareilly, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Badaun and Rampur districts, turnout rose to 65.2%. These districts too have signifi cant Muslim populations who voted in large numbers along with Hindus. ""There is no denying that there is no Muslim MP in UP's 80 Lok Sabha constituencies. That could be a reason for their bid to vote in large numbers and stall BJP from power in the UP assembly,"" says political scientist Ashutosh Mishra.

  As voting moved to central and east UP, voters displayed some indifference. In 2012 assembly polls, 57% voted. In 2017, 57.4% was the turnout. East UP is the state's most backward region and has seen a great degree of out-migration. Tiny land holdings, fl ood-ravaged fi elds and limited jobs are major hardships.
  

  

  Elections don't seem to change conditions; people stay away from the polling process. To involve the poor in the election, parties have incited caste and communal feelings. When PM Modi raised the terror attack at Gonda at the heart of eastern UP, it seemed a clear bid to polarise the voter. Yet, people from this region seemingly remained unmoved: only 57% voted."

  Addressing a public rally at Girijaghar chauraha, where Akhilesh, Rahul and Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav concluded their 8-km-long road show, Rahul, who has been using one film analogy after another to attack the PM referred to Shahrukh Khan blockbuster 'Don' and said it's iconic dialogue applied to the prime minister. ""Modi ji ke jumlon ko rokna mushkil hi nahin naamumkin hai,"" Rahul said, as the crowds cheered.
  

  

  Rahul also raked up Modi's promise to clean the Ganga as well as Varanasi city, and added that the PM had failed the people of Kashi on both counts.
  

  

  Akhilesh, on the other hand, also took a pot shot at Modi for not having delivered on any promise he made to the people of Varanasi. He said, ""Modiji says the people of Kashi will give us an electric shock. But he claims to be the son of Ganga Maiyya. And I ask him to swear on Ganga Maiyya and tell everyone whether or not we deliver 24-hour power supply to Kashi. I want to tell him the real 'electric' shock will be delivered to him.""
  

  

  Akhilesh also brought up the controversy the BJP raked up around Rahul's comments on 'coconut juice' from Manipur being exported from India. While the Congress VP has not countered Modi, Akhilesh, as a part of the new SP-Congress friendship, came ou in his support. He said, ""Modi ji pineapple to nariyal bol dete hain.

  Assembly segments of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency of firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, and Mau, where jailed gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari is in fray, figure in this penultimate phase of polling that will also cover some districts bordering Nepal.
  

  

  Around 1.72 crore voters, including 94.60 lakh men and 77.84 lakh women, are eligible to cast their votes in this round to decide the fate of 635 candidates.
  

  

  The districts going to polls tomorrow are Mau, Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Deoria, Azamgarh and Ballia.
  

  

  Azamgarh Lok Sabha constituency has 10 assembly seats, of which SP had won nine in 2012, but this time Mulayam has not addressed a single meeting in his parliamentary constituency.
  

  

  The prestige of Union minister Kalraj Mishra, who represents Deoria in the Lok Sabha, too is at stake, besides that of Adityanath.
  

  

  BJP is contesting 45 seats and its ally Apna Dal one. Another BJP partner Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party is contesting 3 seats.
  

  

  While BSP has fielded candidates on all 49 seats, SP is contesting 40 seats and Congress 9 seats under an alliance.
  

  

  Prominent candidates in this phase include BSP turncoat Swami Prasad Maurya from Padrauna (Kushinagar), former BJP state president Surya Pratap Shahi from Pathardeva (Deoria), Shyam Bahadur Yadav (SP), son of former Governor Ram Naresh Yadav from Fulpur Pawai (Azamgarh), SP turncoats Ambika Chowhdury and Narad Rai, who are contesting on BSP ticket from Fefna (Ballia) and Ballia Sadar respectively.
  

  

  Mukhtar is contesting from Mau and his son Abbas is in fray from adjoining Ghosi seat in Mau district.
  

  

  In the 2012 Assembly polls, of the 49 seats, 27 were won by the SP, 9 by BSP, 7 by BJP, 4 by Congress and 2 by others.
  

  

  There will be 17,926 polling booths in this phase.
  

  

  The highest number of 23 candidates are contesting from Gorakhpur and the least candidates, numbering seven are in pitted for Mohammadabad Gohna seat in Mau district.
  

  

  Central Para Military Forces have already reached the constituencies and carried out flag march in sensitive areas.
  

  

  Indo-Nepal border with Maharajganj and Gorakhpur, and border with Bihar have been sealed.
  

  

  Police patrolling has been intensified along inter district borders and barriers have been erected on highways to keep an eye on movements of vehicles.
  

  

  Campaigning for the sixth phase saw BJP state president K P Maurya likening rivals SP, Congress and BSP to different types of venomous ""snakes"" and ""social cancer"" and urging people to eliminate them by voting for the BJP.
  

  

  Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav countered BJP saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conceded defeat in the polls by talking about a hung house.
  

  

  While mustering votes for BJP, Modi sought to prove wrong the prophets of doom after demonetisation saying the latest GDP data showed note-ban did not affect growth rate but rather improved it.
  

  

  Mocking economists, he said, ""Hard work, in fact, is much more powerful than Harvard.""
  

  

  Sounding highly optimistic of the poll outcome for BJP, Modi said the debate now is whether BJP will get two-third or three-fourth majority.
  

  

  ""Never have elections gone one way like this... there had been no dearth in enthusiasm of voters in all five phases,"" he said.
  

  

  The PM also caught UP Chief Minister on the wrong foot and cited government website to nail him.
  

  

  ""Life in Uttar Pradesh is short and uncertain... Uttar Pradesh resembles Saharan Africa,"" Modi said quoting a para from the state government's official website up.gov.in.
  

  

  On the last day of campaigning BJP President Amit Shah held a road show in Gorakhpur yesterday. Similar road shows were organised at Kushinagar and Azamgarh.
  

  

  During her campaign, BSP supremo Mayawati said the public is ""disenchanted with BJP and SP"" due to the ""wrong policies"" of the Union and the state governments, and accused Modi and Shah of ""dreaming to destroy the state""."

Hari Shankar Tiwari became the country's first politician to triumph in an electoral contest from prison. Over 30 years on, he sits in an off-roader, part of a long cavalcade, riding past bright yellow mustard fields of Gagha, 30 km from Gorakhpur city.
  

  

  It's here that he won six elections on the trot before his run was cut short in 2007. His exploits, and those of a few more bahubalis such as Virendra Pratap Sahi and Sriprakash Shukla, earned Gorakhpur the sobriquet ""Chicago of the east"".
  

  

  Once accused under the anti-terror law, the national security law and the Gangster (Prevention) Act, Tiwari today stands acquitted of all charges. In the 1970s and 1980s, when gang wars raged in Gorakhpur's streets, east UP netas sought the support of dons. That could explain why Tiwari was in Kalyan Singh's ministry, in Mulayam Singh Yadav's and in Mayawati's as well.
  

  

  Now his son Vinay is in a tight contest on a BSP ticket from Chillupar, the seat Tiwari represented. ""His (Tiwari's) infl uence here is immense,"" says Vinay in his election offi ce at Badhalganj.

He spends time at his gaushala, then begins canvassing for Vinay. Ask 'Panditji' about Yogi Adityanath, Gorakhpur's BJP MP, and he shoots back: ""Yogi's a vigilante cowprotector. I care for cows.""

  He bristles at the mere mention of bahubali (strongman). ""Not a single case against me. I fought right up to the Supreme Court and have been acquitted in all cases. If I were a bahubali, would I have won elections?""
  

  

  Tiwari says. Vinay says his father may not entirely be free of the don image, but his good work far outweighs that perception. ""My dad got over 800km of roads built here. The roads you drove to reach here were built by him. The BSP candidate here (Rajesh Tripathi, who defeated Tiwari in 2007) did nothing. Even the Muktidham he built along the Saryu and keeps talking of, is a picnic spot where couples romance, robbing it of its sanctity,"" he says.
  

  

  Allegations of 'jaatiwad' (casteism) get Tiwari's goat. Rivals accuse him of starting a Brahmin-Thakur feud here. When asked about it, he calls to the people in his courtyard who bring forward a man. ""This is Sanjay Singh, he has been with me for years and he's a Thakur. You will fi nd many Thakurs with me,"" he says.
  

  

  ""What can I say about what the western press wrote?"" he snaps when asked about a 1980s BBC report that likened Gorakhpur to Chicago. ""A lot of falsehood was spread about me."""
"Uma Bharti takes on Rahul Gandhi over remarks on PM Modi, Ganga","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/uma-bharti-takes-on-rahul-gandhi-over-remarks-on-pm-modi-ganga/articleshow/57454354.cms","NEW DELHI: Taking on Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over cleaning of the Ganga, Union Minister Uma Bharti on Friday asked the Congress leader to refrain from making ""frivolous"" comments.
  

  

  The union minister for water resources claimed the work on cleaning the river was on. Bharti, who heads the Modi government's ambitious Namami Gange programme, said phase I of the Clean Ganga Mission, launched in July 2016, was intended to be complete by October next year.
  

  

  ""Rahul says Ganga has not been cleaned yet. We will show results of phase I works in October 2018. Rahul should accompany me to Banaras then and I will show him that the work has been completed,"" Bharti told PTI over phone from Varanasi.
  

  

  ""If the work is complete, he should jump into the Ganga. If it's not, I will. He should not make frivolous comments about Ganga.""
  

  

  Uma Bharti also targeted Rahul for attacking Modi over his ""son of the Ganga from Gujarat"" comment, saying the Congress leader should know that his mother Sonia Gandhi ""reveres the river"" despite her Italian origin.
  

  

  ""He (Rahul) says Prime Minister is from Gujarat and calls Ganga his maa (mother) ... kafi chhote dimag ke aadmi hain Rahul (he is narrow-minded). He is not aware that the entire world considers Ganga its mother,"" she said.
  

  

  Rahul had on Thursday accused Modi of making ""conditional promises and deals"" even with ""Ganga maa"".
  

  

  Alleging that PM Modi did not only make promises to Ganga, but even struck deals with her, Gandhi said, ""Modi told Maa Ganga that first make him the Prime Minister and then he will carry out the cleaning work.""
  

  

  ""Modi strikes a relationship with mother Ganga saying he is the son of Banaras and that mother Ganga called him there (to contest Lok Sabha polls),"" Gandhi told a poll rally in Varanasi.
  

  

  Asking whether the Ganga had only one son and ""that too from Gujarat"", Gandhi had said the holy river belonged to everyone and not any single person.
  

  

  The Union minister attacked Congress alliance with Samajwadi Party and said Rahul Gandhi had aligned with ""Ganga's enemy"", the UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav who, she alleged, tried to hamper the project.
  

  

  She alleged that Akhilesh Yadav did not give the 'No Objection Certificate' for starting the Phase I of the project in UP. She said the first phase covered five river basin states of Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, besides UP.
  

  

  ""I urge Rahul to not rush to Thailand after the (assembly) polls. He should come and see that the work is being carried out in four states.
  

  

  ""He is sitting with Ganga's enemy. I have evidence that Akhilesh did not give NOC. Will Rahul give up his friendship with Akhilesh if he actually swears by Ganga maa?"" she said.
  

  

  Bharti claimed Congress-led governments started working on cleaning the Ganga but ""nothing happened"" for 29 years."
"BJP hopes to maximise its gains in 6th phase of UP assembly polls","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-hopes-to-maximise-its-gains-in-6th-phase-of-up-assembly-polls/articleshow/57454858.cms","NEW DELHI: The BJP has high stakes in the sixth phase of the UP assembly elections, during which 49 constituencies will vote on Saturday.
  

  

  BJP's focus has been the region covered in the sixth round, as the party sees a better possibility of maximising its gains from here in comparison to the stiff contest that awaits it on the 40 seats that go to polls in the final phase on March 8.
  

  

  Targeting a major chunk (25 to 30) of the 49 seats in this backward region of UP, the BJP leadership is banking on its new experiments in wooing the non-Jathav dalit and non-Yadav OBC voters in the seven districts - Maharjaganj, Kushi Nagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia - beyond its traditional upper caste (brahmin and thakur) votebank.
  

  

  While dalits constitute BSP supremo Mayawati's support base, it is the Jathavs among dalits who are considered her committed core votebank. Hence it is to be seen whether the BJP is able to wean away a chunk of the dalit vote that is traditionally BSP's.
  

  

  It is also to be seen if the non-Yadav OBCs (Kurmi and santhwar) shift loyalty from Mayawati to BJP this time. Since the region has the maximum concentration of upper caste voters in Uttar Pradesh that has traditionally been part of BJP's votebank, the party leadership is hoping that it will consolidate in its favour.
  

  

  But in this backward and essentially rural part of the state, where agricultural growth has also been in the negative for the last five years apart from showing poor social indices, and caste rivalries have been traditionally high, it remains to be seen if the brahmins and thakurs come together under the BJP umbrella.
  

  

  With Yogi Adityanath of the Gorakhnath peeth in Gorakhpur leading the BJP's campaign in this belt, it will be interesting to see if brahmins agree to align with this thakur.
  

  

  However, most importantly in this land of poor farmers and agricultural labourers, it will have to be seen whether the Modi government's pro-poor policies (including demonetisation) have worked. If it has, the BJP should stand to gain.
  

  

  Finally, the region is best suited for the BJP's Hindutva brand of politics. Polarisation of voters works best in these regions dominated by upper caste on the one hand and a substantive Muslim population on the other.
  

  

  The BJP has been investing in this region from the build up to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls by tying up with community groups like Rajbhars (Om Prakash Rajbhar's SBSP party) or Nishads by giving them representation - for example Salempur MP Ravindra Kushwaha,or Macchlishahr MP Ram Charitra Nishad -- to upper caste categories who matter in these constituencies.
  

  

  Whether the experiment works for the BJP in a state that essentially votes on caste lines will be revealed only on March 11."

Land-grabbing by powerful goons connected with police and local netas has emerged a major poll plank in east UP.
  

  

  The parties are locked in a blame game, accusing each other of patronage to the bhu-mafi a, promising redress in right earnest. BJP's advertised in local papers that it will form an anti-bhu mafi a task force. On the other hand, BSP district chief Suresh Bharti claims that ""land grabbers are getting nervous as BSP is set to form the government."" SP district head Prahlad Yadav asserts that ""all bhu-mafi as in the area are connected with BJP"", a charge roundly rejected by BJP's Janardan Tiwari. ""In SP's regime, goondas capture land by hoisting the SP flag. Not only in Gorakhpur, this is happening in every part of the state,"" Tiwari said. But voters say they have little hope from politicians.

"Has BJP’s Ujjwala scheme taken shine out of Samajwadi pension?","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/has-bjps-ujjwala-scheme-taken-shine-out-of-samajwadi-pension/articleshow/57459497.cms","LUCKNOW: Are the lakhs of beneficiaries of the Ujjwala scheme, slowly but surely turning into message carriers of the Bharatiya Janata Party to counter UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's Samawadi Pension Scheme?
  

  

  To woo women, mainly from vulnerable and impoverished sections, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had launched Samajwadi Pension Scheme to give Rs 500 a month to female member of households among weaker sections of the society. He claimed that more than 55 lakh women had received pension under the scheme.
  

  

  To counter Akhilesh's Samajwadi Pension Scheme and to make access to ""half the population"", Union petroleum ministry also started Ujjwala scheme last year. An extensive tour of parts of eastern UP which is going to polls in the two final phases on March 4 and March 8 reveals that the BJP has made inroads in the hinterlands through the Ujjwala Yojana. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with Union petroleum minister of state with independent charge Dharmendra Pradhan had launched the national scheme from Ballia on May 1, last year.
  

  

  ""We chose to start this scheme from eastern UP because in a state with only around 56% availability of LPG connections, eastern UP was further behind with only 52%,"" Pradhan had said at the time of the launch of the scheme for which the prime minister has campaigned to make lakhs of villages smoke-free. Only a female member of the family can enjoy the benefit of the scheme.
  

  

  ""In the last 11 months, four oil companies have distributed 53.61 lakh LPG cylinders free to women, mainly in rural parts of the state,"" a senior functionary of the petroleum ministry told the TOI, adding that the national average of LPG availability went up to 72% in less than a year's time.

  When TOI visited villages in Deoria, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur and Basti, Faizabad, majority of the women were grateful for free LPG connection. ""We are very thankful to mantri ji (Dharmendra Pradhan ),"" was the general refrain as women who said they had never dreamr of such facility in their life while using fuel wood collected from nearby forests. On being asked how did got the LPG connection, they said oil companies had organised camps for registration after verification of personal details.
  

  

  This could be the game changer as a good number of women have supported her, claimed Swati Singh, BJP Mahila Morcha's state chief and also a candidate from the Sarojininagar assembly constituency in Lucknow, adding that during the campaign she met a number of women in rural areas who were still dependent on fuel wood but a large number of other families got connections. She said she had not met any of the lakhs woman who have benefited from the Samajwadi Pension Scheme of Rs 500 per month as claimed by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, though she had met hundreds of women who received free LPG cylinders.
  

  

  BJP leaders admit that compared to Ujjawala, no other scheme of the NDA government from Namami Gange to Start UP had reached the rural populace.
  

  

  Dharmendra Pradhan could not campaign in Uttar Pradesh as he was busy in Uttarakhand assembly elections, being in charge of the state and after that he turned focus to panchayat elections in Orissa, where that party gained by more than 300% in rural elections. Pradhan may not have visited UP for campaign, but his footprints are visible wherever Ujjwala scheme has burned the homefire."
"Mail fail: Why Tinku Thakur couldn’t make it to the Army","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/mail-fail-why-tinku-thakur-couldnt-make-it-to-the-army/articleshow/57438918.cms","LUCKNOW: Tinku Thakur, a 22-year-old youth living in Nauranga village of Ballia, missed the opportunity to join the Army this February because he didn't receive his interview letter on time.
  

  

  The letter arrived two days after the interview date because it was sent via a Bihar post office and not from any post office in Ballia. The odd location of his village, which has Ganga on one side and an embankment road on the other, prevents any postman from delivering letters to them. Like him there are over 300 youths across this gram panchayat who are suffering due to the curse of odd location of their villages.
  

  

  This gram panchayat in Bairia constituency comprises four villages — Bhuwal Chapra, Nauranga, Chakki Nauranga and Uddai Chapra — which form the border of UP and Bihar. There are over 25,000 people living in these villages of which around 10,000 are registered voters.
  

  

  Because there's no bridge on Ganga to connect these villages to UP, no post offi ce is able to deliver letters to them, hence they have to depend on a nearby post offi ce in Bhrampur village of Bihar. This takes too much time and their letters reach almost 3-4 months late.
  

  

  These villagers are so miffed with the government's apathy and its reluctance to build a bridge on the Ganga to connect them with UP that they have decided to boycott 2017 elections. Tinku says, ""You can call it my bad luck that I was born in Nauranga.
  

  

  I have missed many opportunities because of a delay in delivery of interview and joining letters.

  ""Like me, there are many in these villages who apply for SSB, CRPF, banking exams every year, but never get to appear on time."" Frustrated with the negligence, the youths of this village formed a 'Yuva Manch' in November 2016 to put forth their demands before the government.
  

  

  ""Because we have no connectivity across the Ganga, patients here have to be taken to a Bihar hospital even though we have good hospitals in Ballia.
  

  

  ""Due to the bad roads, ambulances can't reach here and we carry our patients on cots to a nearby village in Bihar. A bridge is badly needed here, but no one has ever given importance to this,"" said Vashishth Pandey, a local."
"In Gorakhpur, a war rages among Yogi Adityanath’s soldiers","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/in-gorakhpur-a-war-rages-among-yogi-adityanaths-soldiers/articleshow/57441823.cms","GORAKHPUR: In every rally of Yogi Adityanath across eastern UP districts, several of which go to polls on March 4, a group of workers with saffron bands make it a point to be right next to the stage and most vocal with slogans.
  

  

  ""Jo Maharaji ka aadesh ka, wahi karenge (we will do whatever the leader orders),"" one of them, Rajesh Yadav, said in Deoria, asserting the support of Hindu Vahini to its founder, a BJP MP.
  

  

  The right-wing youth outfit, which Adityanath floated in 2002, has decided to field several candidates in eastern UP against the BJP, even as he remains the star campaigner for the party in the region.
  

  

  In Gorakhpur alone, the organisation is fighting on eight seats and giving its support to ten others around the constituency.
  

  

   People like Rajesh Yadav are not willing to speak about rebels such as Sunil Singh, former president of the organisation who has been expelled now by Adityanath himself who is a star campaigner for the party.
  

  

  Sunil Singh, however swears by his ""guru"" Adityanath. ""Maharaj has become Bhishma. We, the expelled members, are the Pandavas. He can’t support us because of his political compulsions, but we are fighting for his honour.""
  

  

  ""The BJP has only used Adityanath to increase its chances and not given him his due place,"" Sunil Singh said. ""Maharaj had taught us in 2002 to fight for honour and as a chela (disciple), I am only doing that,"" he said. The BJP has insulted the MP by not making him a minister or the CM face, and not giving tickets to his candidates, Sunil Singh added.
  

  

  Sunil Singh has resolved to support candidates fighting the BJP across poorvanchal, while his own candidates are fighting on an alliance with the Shiv Sena. The shiv sena in Maharashtra has often opposed the migration of UP workers to the State.
  

  

  ""I am not joining the Sena. I have an alliance with them only for now. My loyalty is only to Yogi Adityanath,"" Singh said.
  

  

  According to him, everything that the rebel group is doing has the “aashirwaad (blessing)” of Adityanath. ""There is nothing that can happen here without his consent. As a chela I am only following the path of my guru.”
  

  

  Sunil Singh said in 2002, too, the organisation after taking blessings from Adityanath had rebelled against the BJP and had succeeded in making their candidates lose.
  

  

  Adityanath is, however, dismissive of the rift. Last month, addressing a meeting of vahini workers, he had said: ""Jisko kachre ki tarah nikal bahar kiya hai, uski kisi bhi tippani pe humein kuch lena dena nahin hai (We have nothing to do with someone we have thrown out like garbage.""
  

  

  The Hindu Yuva Vahini is present in almost every district of Eastern UP and has hundreds of members. ""In early 2000, Hindus here were being lured into religious conversions with a strip of paracetamol and 2 kilos of dal around Gorakhpur. We stopped that,"" said Sunil Singh, adding that the organisation's other main job was to ""check the growth of madrasas and illegal cattle smuggling"" on the Indo-Nepal border.
  

  

  Politically the organisation has a large number of Yadavs generally associated with the Samajwadi party. In fact the vahini also runs flying squads to check copying during exams, an issue the PM spoke about recently.
  

  

  The organisation, say its members, does the job of a defence organisation. ""When Nepal was under communists all these years, the vahini did the work of keeping a check on the borders,"" present chief of the organisation PK Mall told ET, iterating that despite the rebellion, the organisation was firmly with the BJP.
  

  

  Adityanath's organisation has brought Gorakhpur to a standstill several times. Its main fight is to protect Hindus of Gorakhpur from ""the mini Pakistan of Azamgarh.""

  Locals in Gorakhpur, however, say it is Adityanath who matters to them and that he is with the BJP is enough for them to vote for the party. ""Baba's work here has direct impact on many lives. It is a big possibility that he will become the CM if BJP wins. People will vote for the party,"" Nirmal Yadav, a businessman, said.
  

  

  While some believe rebels such as Sunil Singh are floating this controversy for their political interests, others believe that Adityanath had initially sulked as some of his recommended candidates were not given tickets but all is well now.
  

  

  ""Adityanath's influence in this region is unquestionable. Koi patta nahi hilta yaha unke knowledge ke bagair, rebellion toh durr ki baat hai (not even a leaf moves here without his knowledge. Rebellion is far beyond that),""local resident Amar Sinha said.
  

  

  He added that ""as BJP was winning in the State Adityanath's Gorakhpur will also vote for the lotus.""
  

  

  BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said what mattered to people in Gorakhpur was what Adityanath said. ""He is the party's star campaigner. From purab to paschim (east to west), everyone wants him to come to his constituency and speak. It is his word that will matter to people."""
"BJP rides on Balti Baba’s magic to woo voters","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-rides-on-balti-babas-magic-to-woo-voters/articleshow/57453859.cms","KUSHINAGAR: At the crowded Tarya bazaar chauraha in Tamkuhiraj Vidhan Sabha constituency of Kushinagar on Tuesday, Jagdish Mishra alias 'Balti Baba', told voters in his public meeting, ""You voted for Modiji's name once and made him the PM, now vote for his work and make BJP the ruling party in UP."" Being a BJP candidate, Mishra's appeal sounds like that of any other candidate in the constituency, enumerating his party's work and decrying that of the opponents.
  

  

  With a saffron 'gamchha' around his neck, at the age of 70, he and his election paraphernalia including the loading van with a mike and speaker and a group of supporters who clap at every 'high-note' of his election speech, are busy with last-leg campaigning with hardly a minute to spare. The hoi polloi at his election meeting identify him more as 'Balti Baba' than Jagdish Mishra, his real name. People have several of stories to tell on Balti Baba's magical prowess. ""If you wish to eat mithai from Kolkata, Balti Baba can get it for you while sitting here in Kushinagar. Not only that, he would even get you the receipt from the mithai shop in Kolkata from his bucket,"" said Kailash Singh Rathore, a local at Mishra's 'jan-sabha'.
  

  

  And given the number of VIP visitors who keep calling on him, Mishra can also be called a political counsellor. Leaders like Late Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Bhajan Lal used to seek advice from Balti Baba. However, today Mishra tries to play down the moniker that he has earned for his 'magical' (tantrik) deeds. ""Kewal ek upnaam hai (it's only a pet name)"", he said. Mishra has VIP visitors' calling on him not only from UP, but neighbouring states as well. ""He was given the name Balti Baba by Late Indira Gandhi madamji,"" said Madan Tiwari, Mishra's political manager for last 21 years. ""He used to draw out a 'parchi' (chit) from the bucket and that fulfilled people's wish or had a way to make them achieve the intended,"" said Tiwari.
  

  

  Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and his MP wife, Dimple Yadav, are Mishra's ""kaanphukwa shishya"" (disciples whom Mishra has delivered guru-mantra in their ears). BJP president Amit Shah is the recent one to have joined Balti Baba's list of followers. ""It's for the likes of Shah and others only that baba now performs his tantra-vidya. He does not get into tantra-mantra that often now,"" said Tiwari. It's said Mishra left his home in Deoria district of UP at the age of nine. He got initiated into occult at a very early age. ""I have been an MLA from Faazilnagar constituency in 2002, but after delimitation about 75 booths of Faazilnagar were transferred to Tamkuhiraj, hence, I chose to contest from here,"" said Mishra. He briefly sums up issues he is fighting for, ""Ganna (worries of cane farmers), Gandak (changing course of river Gandak) and Goonda (deteriorating law and order).""
  

  

  Mishra has his proximity known to BJP veterans like Murli Manohar Joshi. His election pamphlet has Joshi's photo, though smaller in size than of Modi, but, among his own voters, he might have assumed the image of a 'distanced' leader. ""His connect with people is not that of everyday but very formal and rare,"" said Tribhuvan Singh, a local."

While Chaudhary and Rai have been given a ticket from Phephna and Ballia Sadar, respectively, Mishra has been roped in by Mayawati to carry out anti-SP campaign in and around Ghazipur.
  

  

  Mukhtar Ansari, his brother Sibgatullah and son Abbas are now BSP candidates after their Quami Ekta Dal merged with Mayawati's party. The proposed merger of QED with SP had turned out to be flashpoint in the raging SP feud that saw Mulayam and his brother Shivpal Yadav getting sidelined within the party.
  

  

  Mayawati, too, could feel the heat, as her once close confidante Padrauna MLA Swami Prasad Maurya, after accusing her of selling tickets, is now the BJP candidate from his home seat. His move sparked exodus of around six MLAs from BSP to BJP.
  

  

  Chillupar MLA Rajesh Tripathi rebelled against Mayawati and is now contesting on BJP ticket while Shivpur BSP MLA Uday Lal Maurya quit BSP to join BJP but did not get BJP ticket.
  

  

  Mulayam's loyalists defecting into her camp are important for Mayawati as she finds herself on a sticky wicket in the eastern UP region, where votes of minorities and Most Backward Castes are a challenge."

  With a series of what seemingly minor incidents rapidly taking shape of communal clashes in the recent past, most of the districts in the region are simmering with tension, keeping police on their toes.
  

  

  What has however emerged as a new and rather dangerous pattern is a fact that the region, which was somewhat silent during the elections, is showing signs of restlessness and communal upheaval after polling was held on February 11 and 15 respectively. Even minor altercations and road mishaps are leading to law and order crises. Senior police officers admit that a scenario indicated that all was no well in West UP.
  

  

  The Bulandshahr incident where a video which reportedly showed a man using objectionable language against gods and goddesses went viral triggering off a communal clash was just an indicator of the extent to which the atmosphere was surcharged in and around the district. Mobs went berserk damaging shops owned by another community. The two sides indulged in heavy brick-batting leaving three hospitalized.
  

  

  What happened in Muzaffarnagar on February 25 was even more baffling. A minor altercation between a Dalit and a Muslim youth in Khadarwala area led to panic.
  

  

  The heated exchange that took place a stones throw distance away from a Maha Aarti function at Shiv Chowk, saw the communities came face to face leading to sporadic incidents of stone pelting. The incident saw shopkeepers down their shutters and the market place was deserted in no time.
  

  

  Senior police officers in the region however a design behind whipping up communal passions in the region. ""In two separate incidents, pieces of meat were found outside a temple in the district and at a farm field. The size of the pieces suggested that they were probably of a bovine leading to tension,"" said a senior IPS officer adding that such incidents are a result of some conspiracy as they require planning. In both the incidents the police acted swiftly and managed to contain the situation in time.
  

  

  ""It is a matter of concern we are taking no chances. To ensure quick police response, we have not withdrawn police personnel from UP-100 service despite the fact that almost half of the district police strength is out of station for election deployment in the entire West UP region,"" says Director General of Police (DGP) Javeed Ahmed."

The eagerly awaited outcome will have a
  far-reaching impact on the political fortunes+
  of the three major contenders - BJP, AAP and Congress. The stakes for AAP are the highest as it has barely recovered from its Punjab and Goa defeats.
  

  

  The campaign was marked by high-pitched rhetoric with
  AAP trying to pin BJP down+
  on its record of running the three corporations for many years, but it seems that the latter successfully managed to counter any fallout of anti-incumbency. It showed all its sitting corporators the door and put Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision at the centre of its campaign. It also put AAP on the defensive by making it seem that this would be a referendum on Delhi government's performance. The results will show whether people bought that argument or not. BJP, however, has been jubilant over the exit polls which have given it a huge mandate.
  

  

  AAP made the big-ticket promise of scrapping property tax to sway voters besides highlighting how the insanitary conditions in the capital had led to the outbreak of malaria, dengue and chikungunya and that the BJP-administered corporations were responsible for that.
  

  

  Buoyed by his party's good peformance in the Rajouri Garden byelections, state Congress chief Ajay Maken ran a largely positive campaign, looking for a revival of the grand old party. It came out with six manifestoes. However, Maken was given a nasty jolt by his party colleague, Arvinder Singh Lovely, who joined BJP in a huff, complaining of being neglected, followed by former Delhi Commission for Women chief Barkha Singh. The extent of damage inflicted by these two leaders will be evident on Wednesday.
  

  

  The fate of 2,537 candidates will be
  decided on the basis of 53.53% of voting+
  on Sunday, surpassing marginally the polling figure last time. Once again, unauthorised colonies, slum clusters and areas on the periphery of Delhi voted in large numbers with the urban areas giving a lukewarm response.

  Counting of votes will start at 36 centres across the capital at 8 am and will be held in multiple rounds. Officials from Delhi State Election Commission claimed that the result would be declared by 2-3pm. There are over 1,100 independent candidates and 17 political parties in the fray.

  In an interview, the Aam Aadmi Party leader also accused the Modi government of trying to cripple state governments not with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
  

  

  Saying he was ""100 per cent"" sure EVM tampering prevented an AAP victory in Punjab, Kejriwal told IANS in an interview that this would be tried on Sunday too in Delhi's municipal elections.
  

  

  He said there were three reasons he feared Electronic Voting Machine tampering on Sunday.
  

  

  ""One, pre-2006 EVMs without security features are being used in Delhi; two, these EVMs have no VVPATs; three, the EVMs are coming from Rajasthan (where he said EVMs were tampered with).
  

  

  ""The only way to fail EVM tampering is to vote for the AAP tomorrow in huge numbers... People must defeat the EVM tampering.""
  

  

  Kejriwal denied he was complaining about EVMs because the AAP lost the assembly elections in Punjab and Goa.
  

  

  ""We did not make these allegations earlier when BJP won in Maharashtra and Jharkhand. In the last four months, evidence is emerging of tampering... from Pune, Bhind, Dholpur, Punjab, UP.""
  

  

  He said the Election Commission's refusal to hold an independent investigation into any allegation had only increased the suspicion about EVMs.
  

  

  Kejriwal said the AAP would certainly respond if and when the poll panel invited it to check the EVMs.
  

  

  ""They have not invited anyone... Only stories are planted in the media. They first agreed to let us check the EVMs before the Delhi polls. Then they said they could be checked after the polls. Why not earlier?""
  

  

  Accusing the Modi government of doing ""everything to stop us from working"", the AAP leader said his party wasn't the sole victim of such vindictive politics.
  

  

  ""In the whole country, BJP seems to have just one aim: if people don't vote for them, they won't let the governments function... Be it Arunachal, Manipur, Goa... They break governments... they lure MLAs.
  

  

  ""The tragedy is people who do now what Bhajan Lal once did are being painted as 'master strategists' while the parties which lose MLAs are blamed for the situation.
  

  

  ""Only we keep fighting and getting things done. Others are bending on their knees.""
  

  

  Kejriwal said the BJP-controlled municipal corporations had turned Delhi into a garbage dump in the last decade. ""Now they want to cover up their 10 years of failure and corruption in the name of Modi.""
  

  

  If the AAP won the municipal polls, ""we will start cleaning up Delhi on a war footing and we will make the city sparkle in just one year"", he said.
  

  

  ""House tax will go. And in less than three years, Delhi will be free of dengue and chikungunya.""
  

  

  The municipal corporations, he said, had ""more power, more responsibility, more departments and were more independent"" than the Delhi government he heads.

"BJP offering plum posts to poach MLAs, says AAP","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/bjp-offering-plum-posts-to-poach-mlas-says-aap/articleshow/58370100.cms","NEW DELHI: A day before the civic poll verdict, AAP has alleged that BJP is trying to poach its MLAs. Disclosing the names of two of its MLAs - Alka Lamba from Chandni Chowk and Praveen Deshmukh from Jangpura - the party alleged that they received calls from BJP leaders who offered them plum posts and elevation. BJP has threatened AAP with defamation for making ""baseless"" allegations.
  

  

  ""This is not the first incident. BJP has been resorting to this act in Delhi as well as in other states. Politics is not the only mission of these people (AAP MLAs) but to change the country; BJP will face disappointment,"" said AAP Delhi convener Dilip Kumar Pandey. He said his party has evidence to back its allegations and it will produce it when the time is right.

  Lamba tweeted her claim that she had received a call from a BJP leader but did not name the caller. ""Through its functionaries, BJP is approaching AAP MLAs who tell them that AAP is likely to be finished. They are saying that with a recommendation from Amit Shah we will get you political elevation and positions in government,"" she tweeted in Hindi.
  

  

  ""The BJP leader who called cited the example of Shazia Ilmi to lure me,"" Lamba tweeted. Ilmi was with AAP but had joined BJP before the 2015 assembly elections. ""BJP might have succeeded in buying Congress leaders. We cannot be bought,"" said Lamba.

  AAP's Bawana MLA, Ved Prakash, had joined BJP just ahead of the civic polls. What is also being keenly watched is the office-of-profit case. Around a month before the civic polls, Election Commission concluded its hearing agaAinst 21 AAP legislators who were appointed parliamentary secretaries.
  

  

  BJP has rubbished AAP's allegations. ""After its defeat in Punjab, Goa and Rajouri Garden, its leaders have lost their mental balance,"" said Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal, adding, ""AAP is not based on any political ideology. It was formed by a queer combination of heterogenous elements for grabbing power, and when defeat is looming large, the party is disintegrating."""
"JD(U) confident of good show in Delhi municipal polls","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/jdu-confident-of-good-show-in-polls/articleshow/58307074.cms","NEW DELHI: As electioneering for the municipal polls drew to a close on Friday, Janata Dal (United) claimed that it will turn in a handsome performance which will mark its emergence as a serious player in Delhi politics.
  

  

  ""We have provided voice to migrants from Bihar and eastern UP who were used not just by BJP and Congress but also by Arvind Kejriwal as fodder, but were denied a say in decision-making. JD(U) entered the fray because of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's desire to find space for those who have so far languished on the margins despite having enough numbers to influence the outcome,"" JD(U) general secretary Sanjay Jha said.
  

  Top Commentit will be zero and loosing the depositsSaranathan Lakshminarasimhan

  Jha denied the suggestion that his party was just a ""nuisance factor"" and would achieve little beyond being a spoiler in a few seats where Poorvanchalis are preponderant. ""This is an arrogant assumption typical of those who have taken the Poorvanchalis for granted and continue to see politics through a prism which has been rendered irrelevant by change in Delhi's demography. Just wait for the result and you will see,"" said the JD(U) leader who was hand-picked by Nitish Kumar to oversee his party's campaign in Delhi.
  

  

  The party's ambition has been fuelled by its assessment that a huge chunk of Poorvanchalis — a sprawling constituency which played a big role in Kejriwal's landslide in the assembly polls — are angry with AAP for not reciprocating its support. These migrants from Bihar and eastern UP, so goes JD(U)'s calculation, are unlikely to vote for Congress or BJP because both gave them a raw deal."
"Might of crores versus spirit of ‘ordinary’: Who’ll win?","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/might-of-crores-vs-spirit-of-ordinary-wholl-win/articleshow/58307091.cms","NEW DELHI: It is a fight between Rs 50 crore and Rs 5,000. BJP candidate Rajpal Singh in Sriniwaspuri has assets worth Rs 50 crore, while independent candidate Gayatri Devi has a measly Rs 5,000 against her name. ""Devi will not even get 100 votes,"" declared Singh. The statement isn't borne of financial arrogance, only the lawyer's optimism as a veteran BJP activist with the advantage of having the prime minister to inspire voters with.
  

  

  However, 37-year-old Devi, who has studied only up to Class XII, remained unfazed. ""People do not vote for a moneyed man, only for those who help them,"" she countered. The social worker hopes to leverage her reputation as a social worker against Singh's rupees and his party at the hustings.
  

  

  Democracy can be quirky, slating billionaires on the same voting machine as humbly endowed rivals. Singh vs Devi for a place in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation is intriguing, but the richest in the fray is Geeta Yadav in Mehrauli. Contesting for an SDMC seat as an independent backed by Swaraj India, Yadav's affidavit puts her assets at Rs 84 crore, the highest among the 2,537 men and women aspiring to the corporation seats. Yadav's rival, BSP's Poonam, only has Rs 30,000 in cash and Rs 1,000 in a bank account though she has jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh and her husband, Rs 7 lakh.
  

  

  ""I may be the richest candidate, but my campaign style is very simple,"" claimed 46-year-old Yadav. ""My husband and I ride a scooter, and I have no paid helpers."" But it is a clever ploy, because the housewife-politician herself confided, ""Mehrauli's people are frustrated with candidates who come in big vehicles to seek votes and disturb them."" Yadav thinks she will win handsomely, not because of her money, but the voters' confidence in her, not to forget that Congress is hobbled by two rebel candidates and BJP is beset by infighting.

  Like Yadav, her rival Poonam, 36, too entered politics because of deep unhappiness over the non-existent civic services. ""My people are my assets,"" asserted Poonam, an uneducated, self-made woman who runs a boutique. She is assured that her involvement in social work will see her through.
  

  

  Some municipal seats have gaping financial disparities. In Sadar Bazar, Mohammad Usman, the Congress nominee with assets of Rs 57 crore, is taking on Naveen Sharma, an independent with a less than Rs 35,000. In Vishnu Garden, Congress candidate Dhanwant Chandela, worth Rs 55 crore, is tussling with a rival who has just Rs 7,000. And in Preet Vihar, the richest candidate has Rs 42 crore against one of his rivals' Rs 12,000.
  

  

  According to the Association of Democratic Reforms, there are 74 candidates who possess assets worth over Rs 10 crore, 106 candidates, over Rs 5 crore, and 517 candidates, over Rs 1 crore.
  

  

  At the other end of the spectrum, Priya Jha, independent candidate from Sant Nagar, and Sunita Gill, NCP candidate from Adarsh Nagar, do not have a single rupee to their name."
"We’ll launch stir if EVMs defeat us: CM Arvind Kejriwal","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/well-launch-stir-if-evms-defeat-us-cm/articleshow/58352111.cms","NEW DELHI: Expressing his apprehension that EVMs may spoil AAP's prospects, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has threatened to launch an agitation if the outcome of the polls is what the exit polls have suggested.
  

  

  Most exit polls have predicted a clean sweep by BJP in the three corporations and poor show by AAP. Party sources said Kerjiwal's call for an agitation related to EVMs and the growing doubts over their reliability.
  

  

  ""Now if we lose on Wednesday....if the results are what was being said last night (referring to exit polls), toh hum eent se eent baja denge,"" Kejriwal is heard telling a meeting of partymen in a video clip uploaded on Twitter. AAP was born out of a movement and it will not hesitate to go back to its roots, he is heard saying in another clip.
  

  

  ""If such results come, then it would prove that manipulation has happened, like in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Pune, Mumbai, Bhind and Dholpur. We are the product of a movement. We are not here to enjoy the pleasures of power. We will return to the movement,"" he said.
  

  

  Kejriwal said more than winning or losing, he was bothered about the ""unabated tampering of EVMs"" across the country and ""betrayal"". He cited alleged instances of AAP getting barely two votes in villages in Punjab, ""even in places where people booed the Akalis out"".
  

  

  Party sources who were present at the meeting explained that his statement — ""eent se eent baja dengey"" — referred to an agitation on the lines of the anti-corruption movement on the issue of EVM tampering.

  Kerjiwal was addressing partymen at a thanksgiving programme organised at his house. He cited examples of AAP workers who knew the pulse of the people as they were in the field most of the time.
  

  

  He pointed at MLA Mahendra Yadav as an example. He ""wakes up at 5am and goes around his area till 8 pm asking people about their problems. He is known in his area as motorcyclewala MLA. Where will you find an MLA who takes feedback and reaches out to all the people every day in his constituency! Who would know more than him about the ground feel,"" Kejriwal said to make his point that people were supporting AAP.

  The meeting was attended by senior leaders, including Ashutosh and Kumar Vishwas. ""Survival of AAP is necessary not to just win a few states; it is important for the country,"" said Vishwas.
  

  

  AAP Delhi convener Dilip Pandey, meanwhile, told PTI that the corporation poll results could be ""rigged"" and the ground for it was being prepared by ""floating"" exit polls predicting a BJP sweep. ""If this is what the exit polls are saying, it is clear that the EVMs have been tampered with,"" he said."

"Exit polls project a clean sweep for BJP","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/exit-polls-project-a-clean-sweep-for-bjp/articleshow/58333622.cms","NEW DELHI: Two exit polls on Sunday predicted crushing victories for the BJP in all three municipal corporations in Delhi and a complete rout for AAP and Congress.
  

  

  While the India Today-Axis poll gave the BJP between 202 and 220 seats of the 272 up for grabs, the ABP News-CVoter poll gave it 218 seats.
  

  

  Both polls gave the BJP three-fourths majorities in each of the three corporations and suggested that AAP and Congress would finish up with fairly similar tallies in the region of 20-odd seats each.
  

  

  If the predictions are proved right, it would be a remarkable achievement for a party that was battling ten years of incumbency in the corporations and replaced all its corporators. It would also be a huge setback for AAP on its home turf.
  

  

  Coming on the back of a poor performance in Goa and a worse than expected showing in Punjab, it would raise the question of whether the fledgling party has run out of steam after a stunning performance in the 2015 assembly polls.
  

  

  The India Today poll forecast that the BJP would win 78-84 seats in the 104-member North corporation, 79-85 in the 104-member South and 45-51 of the East's 64. It put the Congress neck and neck in the North with 8-12 seats each and the AAP perhaps marginally ahead of the Congress in the South and East.
  

  

  Overall, it predicted 19-31 seats for Congress and 23-35 for AAP.

  The ABP News poll gave the BJP 84-90 seats in the North, 80-86 in the South and 45-51 in the East.
  

  

  AAP, it predicted would win 5-11 seats in the North, 7-13 in the South and 4-10 in the East, for a total tally between 16 and 34 seats.
  

  

  The Congress, it forecast, would win 4-10 in the North, 7-13 in the South and 5-11 in the East, once again totaling to between 16 and 34.
  

  

  While AAP would be the biggest loser in such a scenario, the Congress too would suffer a huge setback at a time when the Rajouri Garden assembly by-election results had raised hopes in its ranks of a revival in Delhi."
"Names struck off list, just like that","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/names-struck-off-list-just-like-that/articleshow/58333598.cms","NEW DELHI: It was a big disappointment for Sahiba Yaseen in Shaheen Bagh. Exercising her civic right for the first time in her life, the 19-year-old had queued up with the goodly crowd to vote in the municipal elections. But her mood turned glum when the polling officers turned her away at the polling booth. ""I have my voter ID card and I was looking forward to casting my first ever vote today,"" the crestfallen Yaseen told TOI.
  

  

  Yaseen's name was missing from the electoral rolls. The first timer might have been thwarted, but like Pawan Chaudhary, she will realise soon enough that people often find themselves disenfranchised for no apparent reasons.
  

  

  Chaudhary, 60, has voted in almost every election. On Sunday too, he walked to the MCD Primary School in Mallikpur to elect the corporator from the GTB Nagar ward. His daughters, Richa and Juhi, were with him. Once there, he found to his dismay that his name was not on the voters' list
  

  

  ""It will be the first time of my life that I did not vote,"" said Chaudhary, resident of Q Block, Model Town. Richa and Juhi were, however, able to press the EVM button.
  

  

  ""In the electoral roll, someone named Gautam Kumar was entered in the slot where my father's name should have appeared,"" said Juhi. The three checked the list of deleted voters, but Chaudhary's name did not appear there either.
  

  

  In the Jama Masjid ward, Rizwan Ahmad similarly found he was not listed as a voter, leaving him wondering, ""I know that names are deleted when the voter dies, but am I not still alive?"" Ahmad argued with the polling personnel, who pleaded helplessness. He had braved the heat to come out around noon to vote, and returned home a downcast citizen.

  If Chaudhary and Ahmad could think of no reason why their names should have been precluded from the electoral rolls, the mother-son duo of Sharda and David Robert reached Deshbandhu College in Kalkaji only to find that though they had got the change of address recorded with the election authorities and had even been given the voter slip by local volunteers, the official list contained no mention of them. ""Our votes have been made worthless by someone else's error,"" said the mother.
  

  

  Noor Nishan, resident of Shaheen Bagh, couldn't nearly vote too. Polling agents told the bemused Nishan that she had already voted. ""I have only now come to cast my vote,"" pleaded Nishan, showing her unmarked left-hand ring finger.
  

  

  On checking back, the agents realised that they had ticked her name instead of the one above her in the rolls. They cross-checked with the signature register and realised the clerical error. ""Had this fact not been brought to our notice, a vote would have been missed,"" said Parvez Alam Khan, the Congress candidate.
  

  

  Polling officers cited election rules for disallowing voters whose names were missing from approaching the EVM. But their arguments were of no consolation to the many enthusiastic voters who returned home, their choices unregistered, their fingers unmarked."
"BJP wages poster war on AAP","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/bjp-wages-poster-war-on-aap/articleshow/58321244.cms","NEW DELHI: Even on the eve of the municipal elections, there was no truce on the poster war between BJP and Aam Aadmi Party, in which the two contenders have serially blamed the other for the capital's civic woes. On Saturday, a fresh set of hoardings greeted Delhi's voters. ""Until when will AAP run from its responsibilities, Kejriwal? Who is responsible for water supply, electricity supply and maintaining sewage system? Answer the public, don't threaten them,"" read the boards at major intersections of the city.
  

  

  Kuljeet Singh Chahal, BJP general secretary, said this party had commissioned these hoardings in response to those put up by AAP claiming that BJP would increase the rates of water and electricity if it was elected to the three civic bodies. ""Misinformation is being spread and people are being virtually threatened,"" alleged Chahal. ""We are asking AAP to respond to the public, not to threaten them.""
  

  

  AAP's campaign has largely centred on its success in providing cheap electricity and free water, while promising the waiver of residential property tax. At every poll meeting, AAP leaders emphasised how the party had delivered on its promise to cut electricity rate by half and to waive charges on water up to 20,000 litres per month.
  

  

  Following its unexpectedly poor performance in the Rajouri Garden assembly by-polls, AAP had announced on billboards placed at Geeta Colony, Khajuri Chowk, Bhajanpura, Akshardham, Mayur Vihar Extension and some other places that if the saffron party won the civic polls, it would increase the rate of water and electricity charges. ""To stop this, vote for Kejriwal,"" the hoardings exhorted. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had reiterated these charges at an election rally in Burari. ""Do not vote for BJP, otherwise you will stop getting free water and cheap electricity,"" the CM had said.

  Chahal pointed out that Kejriwal had also claimed that water pipelines were being broken by BJP activists to turn the people against AAP. ""Their entire campaign was based on lies and misleading statements,"" fumed Chahal.
  

  

  AAP volunteers have also posted several cartoons on social media showing Kejriwal in the guise of superhero Jhaaduman. In the cartoons, Kejriwal, a broom in his hand, promises voters a spick and span Delhi and corruption-free municipal corporations.

"Delhi municipal polls peaceful barring a few glitches","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/polls-peaceful-barring-a-few-glitches/articleshow/58333608.cms","NEW DELHI: Except for a few arguments and minor scuffles, Sunday's polling was largely peaceful, said Delhi Police. Around 861 calls were received about heated arguments and minor scuffles, booth capture and faulty EVMs from across the city till 6pm. But around 70% of them were resolved immediately while legal action has been initiated against just 5%, said the police.

  The police had to intervene in a scuffle in Ambedkar Nagar where a political leader alleged that she was attacked by some people.
  

  

  A police team was also put on standby following reports of firing outside a booth in the Bindapur area of southwest Delhi. However, the call was found to be bogus. Around the evening, a candidate from Rohini alleged that he was beaten up by goons outside his house. The police are probing his claim.
  

  

  According to the police data, 127 calls about various issues related to polling booths were received from Rohini alone. A senior official said most of the calls were from members of political parties who complained about defective EVMs, distribution of money and liquor by opposition parties and bogus voting.
  

  

  A multi-layer security arrangement was put in place at 13,022 booths — 197 hypersensitive and 575 sensitive — located in 770 buildings. Besides 56,256 Delhi Police personnel, 40 companies of paramilitary forces and 20,000 home guards were deployed. The police also met the candidates and election managers of all parties to ensure that workers didn't clash with each other."
"Capital contest: Polls to local bodies, but interest is national","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/capital-contest-polls-to-local-bodies-but-interest-is-national/articleshow/58322175.cms","NEW DELHI: The stage is set for one of the mostly keenly anticipated
  municipal polls in the capital+
  on Sunday after a hard and bitterly fought campaign pitted BJP, AAP and Congress in a triangular fight.
  

  

  Smaller outfits like the Janata Dal (U), BSP and Swaraj India further spiced up the electoral broth. But one reason why this local contest has sparked national interest is that the BJP campaign sought to cash in on PM Modi's popularity and ""good governance"" promise while there is intense interest in whether AAP holds onto its home turf.
  

  

  Coming just a little more than a month after
  BJP's big success in UP+
  and it's more recent
  win in the Rajouri Garden assembly bypoll+
  , the party is tipped as the front runner despite a two-term incumbency in Delhi's three municipal bodies.
  

  

  The stakes are no less significant for AAP that will hope to reverse a losing streak following a
  disappointing show in Goa and Punjab+
  . For Congress, encouraged by a second place finish in Rajouri Garden, the challenge is to retain the momentum.
  

  

  Interestingly, the civic election is being perceived as much a referendum on AAP's record in office as it is about BJP in the backdrop of an acrimonious row over funding and powers of civic bodies.
  

  

  The campaign has been marked by defections, primarily from Congress to BJP, as the latter seeks to embellish its winning credentials. BJP leaders, however, expect a tough contest as the party changed its candidates, opting for relatively inexperienced newcomers.
  

  

  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has
  campaigned vigorously+
  and AAP faces a crucial test two years past its term in office. A revival will energise the party and indicate that its base of less privileged voters is with it while a poor finish can widen the internal fissures that defeats in Goa and Punjab brought to the surface. Over 1.3 crore people are eligible to vote on Sunday, with predictions of cooler weather raising prospects of a better turnout.
  

  

  The contest will see 270 seats across three municipal corporations of Delhi going to polls. The total number of candidates has gone up slightly this time when compared to the 2012 poll, with 2,537 contesting. Poll officials are, however, keeping fingers crossed for a higher voter turnout.
  

  

  In 2012, municipal polls saw a record breaking turnout with 58% of the total voters casting their votes. Police and state election commission have not left anything to chance with the deployment of over 56,000 personnel drawn from central paramilitary forces, home guards and different units of Delhi Police to ensure peaceful, fair and free elections.

  A few units have been kept in reserve, in case required. Despite aggressive opposition from AAP, the polls would be held on EVMs and voters have been asked not to carry mobile phones inside the polling booths. More than the civic issues, the election has been fought on allegations and counter allegations but the parties have promised moon to the voters. Now it's the time for the voters to decide which party convinced them the most.
  

  

  AAP has brushed aside the unfavourable Rajouri Garden bypoll results and ruled out any reflection of this in the civic elections. Political observers think the civic poll is a referendum on the work of AAP-led Delhi government and a litmus test for CM Arvind Kejriwal.
  

  

  Under Kejriwal's leadership, AAP has come out with a strong manifesto promising clean and corruption-free Delhi like other parties. BSP has fielded 196 candidates, less than 250 candidates it had fielded in 2012. To fill the political vacuum JD (U), which contested on around a dozen seats in 2012, has fielded 91 candidates. The 211 candidates fielded by Swaraj India will be considered as Independent candidates as the party is yet to be recognised by the EC.
  

  

  With 29 candidates from Samajwadi Party and other small parties might take a huge bite of the vote share of key players (BJP, Congress, AAP) in their quest to make their mark in the civic polls. A mock poll will be conducted to ensure all EVMs are working properly and poll officials claimed that they have kept EVMs in reserve in case any machine malfunctions. Polling for two wards - Maujhpur and Sarai Pipal --has been postponed due to the death of contesting candidates. For Maujhpur ward, polls will be held on May 14 and Sarai Pipal on May 21."

"Some Muslim voters back in Congress fold","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/some-muslims-back-in-cong-fold/articleshow/58389028.cms","NEW DELHI: The Muslim community had played a big part in the Aam Aadmi Party's astounding triumph in the assembly elections of 2015. However, Wednesday's municipal poll results seemed to indicate that the community may have partly reverted to Congress, the party they traditionally support.
  

  

  Wards with Muslims making up more than 40% of the voters did not all return AAP candidates, with the votes being shared by AAP and Congress.
  

  

  Many Muslim voters admitted that AAP's promises had not enthused them this time. ""The promise of property tax waiver, for instance, was of little importance to many Muslims who mostly live in unauthorised colonies where these taxes are not applicable,"" said a resident of Zakir Nagar.
  

  

  AAP, however, maintained that it was wrong to say its Muslim support was migrating. Amanatullah Khan, AAP MLA from Okhla, in fact, accused the other parties of deceit to win over Muslim voters.
  

  

  ""Many poor Muslim jhuggi dwellers were given bribes a day before the polls,"" Khan claimed. He also asserted that the voting machines had been ""managed"" to transfer votes to Congress.
  

  

  Congress, for its part, believed that not only Muslims, but most poor sections of society had shifted loyalties to the party. ""AAP was voted to power by these sections, which now feels betrayed because it has not fulfilled the promises it has made to them,"" declared Farhad Suri, Congress leader and former leader of the Opposition in the south corporation.

  BJP too claimed that the Muslims had lost faith in Arvind Kejriwal. ""AAP has done no work in Muslim-majority areas since coming to power,"" opined Atif Rashid, Delhi BJP's Minority Morcha president. BJP itself could not boast of a single victory from the five seats where it had nominated Muslim candidates. However, Rashid maintained that BJP had gained the support of Muslims ""as is evident from the increase in our vote share in the five Muslim-majority wards"".
  

  

  Rashid also claimed that most Pasmanda, or lower-caste Muslims, had cast their lot with BJP. ""
  

  

  We gave tickets to five Pasmanda candidates. This instilled confidence in the Muslim community,"" said Rashid. AAP's Khan countered this by pointing out that there was ""no such thing as a Pasmanda or an Ashrafi voting for BJP"". ""No Muslim will ever vote for BJP,"" Khan asserted.
  

  

  While the BJP's Muslim candidates had expressed the hope that Muslims would vote in the saffron party's favour because it believed that divorce through triple talaq was not socially just, Rashid differed and said the party's stand on the custom had not played a role in the polls. ""Triple talaq is a social issue, and people voted only on the basis of local issues,"" concluded Rashid."
"With inked fingers, youth set agenda","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/with-inked-fingers-youth-set-agenda/articleshow/58333652.cms","NEW DELHI: The first-time voters — some of them past their teens but exercising their franchise for the first time — were an enthusiastic lot on Sunday as Delhi turned out to decide who will run the three corporations in the city for the next five years. While for many of them it was like a rite of passage and an assertion of their right as a citizen, some were quite focused on the issues that ought to be tackled by the new corporations.
  

  

  Sanitation was identified as a top concern, cutting across economic backgrounds and class. From open drains to dirty roads and unfinished civil works, these voters had a set of concrete demands.
  

  

  Simran, a 20-year-old resident of Laxmi Nagar, said her main concern was cleanliness in the city. ""I have voted for a party which I think will focus on keeping the city clean,"" she said, without revealing her choice. Similarly, Tamanna, a 20-year-old from Kalkaji Extension, complained that the drains in her area were always overflowing. ""I will vote for whoever can deal with the sanitation problem,"" she told TOI, still unsure of the candidate while standing in the queue to cast her vote.
  

  

  Ismat Jahan, a 24-year-old from Trilokpuri, was seeking redressal of her grievances, a councillor ""who would heed our complaints."" Originally from Allahabad, she had shifted to Delhi after getting married. Voting for the first time, she observed that the lack of coordination on completion of civil works had become the capital's bane. ""They had dug up our lane to repair the sewer line but they took many days to do the repair work though we complained several times,"" she said.

  However, there were many youngsters out in the heat, armed with their ID cards, who had turned up just for the experience. They took selfies and enthusiastically posed for photographs, showing their inked fingers. Lakshmi Tiwari, a resident of Nanakpura, said: ""I was encouraged by my sister who is enrolled in the paramilitary forces. She always tells me the importance of taking a stand and exercising my right as a voter which is why I came here"". Her sister, Roli Singh, who had accompanied her to the polling booth, said it was extremely important for the younger generation to participate in the electoral process.
  

  

  A student, Charu Goel, from Karol Bagh looked thrilled. She said she had always wanted to vote and was proud to have finally taken the step after turning 18. ""I believe that if anyone wants to voice their opinion on politics, they must do so after casting their vote and fulfilling their duty as a responsible citizen,"" said Goel. She added that she was a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that he had inspired her to cast her vote.
  

  

  There were some first-timers though who were unaware of the the exact role of the corporations. Jyoti Das, a 20-year-old from Chittaranjan Park, said her main concern was the lack of cash in ATMs and she wanted someone to address that. ""Students from outside Delhi find it very difficult to function without cash. We have to stand in queues outside ATMs which most of the time don't have money,"" she complained. Simran of Laxmi Nagar confessed that she was not aware of the functions of the municipal corporations but had come to vote nevertheless.
  

  

  The enthusiasm of the youngsters was palpable. Priya Negi , a 19-year-old from Burari, said had she asked her friends to also vote this time as the next generation should develop a habit of casting votes. ""A lot of us skip elections thinking our vote won't make a difference but it does. All of us should vote,"" said Negi."

  But things weren't all smooth for many such voters. At CR Park, Pragya Deora, a 26-year old PhD scholar, had to rely on her sense of touch to select the button on the EVM. ""They had no Braille voting sheets,"" she informed. ""An official read out the order of candidates and told me to count the buttons to select my choice.""
  

  

  At Shaheen Bagh, Mohammed Imitiaz had to brave more than the afternoon sun to reach the polling booth. He looked lost and hassled as he made his way past the uneven schoolground, with no signage or volunteers to assist him. He bore this stoically, insisting, ""I have to vote no matter what the circumstances.""
  

  

  Many voters complained about the lack of wheelchairs and ramps for the disabled. At Sant Nirankari School, wheelchair-bound Alakh Ram made a painful way to the EVM, though he too remained defiant, saying, ""There is no option if you want the right person who can solve the locality's problems."" In Nanakpura, Jayanti Talwar was irked to find that her brother in his wheelchair could not negotiate the stairs to reach the booth. ""This polling station was not in the least disabled-friendly,"" she grumbled.
  

  

  One voting venue in Vasant Kunj was a pleasant exception, however, with two wheelchairs there for the use of voters. Officials at some stations allowed the elderly and disabled to cut to the front of the queues to spare them inconvenience. At Pitampura, officials even allowed such voters to drive to the polling stations."
"Low-income colonies saw high turnout","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/low-income-colonies-saw-high-turnout/articleshow/58352187.cms","NEW DELHI: Though the capital registered a record turnout in the municipal elections with 53.53% of voting, data for the 270 municipal wards show that the poll percentage was relatively lower in the upscale and middle-class wards than outer Delhi, slums and unauthorised colonies. This indicates that the city's periphery wants it to be heard. The outcome of the civic polls could also reflect the sentiment of a growing migrant population, which is redefining the social profile of the city.
  

  

  The 104 wards in south and north corporations recorded a total of 51.5% and 54.1% of voting respectively, while the east civic body witnessed the highest turnout — 56.05%. Voting figures released by the state election commission show that affluent localities like Greater Kailash, Vasant Kunj, Preet Vihar, Patparganj, Kalkaji and Chittaranjan Park — where RWAs are quite active — were lagging behind when compared to the residents in their neighbouring slums.
  

  

  Areas which recorded 60% and above polling either fall in outer Delhi or belong to unauthorised colonies and slum clusters. The voter turnout in majority of the wards with upscale colonies remained below 50%. For instance, the Greater Kailash ward recorded only 42.4% of voting while the Bhati ward, which comprises slum and rural areas, recorded 65% of polling. Dwarka A, which is a model ward and a home to upper middle-class population, recorded only 40.8% of polling. The turnout in other urban wards like RK Puram, Lajpat Nagar, Hauz Khas, Safdarjung Enclave, Munirka, Malviya Nagar and Defence Colony was below 50%. Vasant Vihar and Vasant Kunj had 46.7% and 45.2% of voting respectively.
  

  

  Similarly, in old Delhi, which has densely populated wards like Chandni Chowk, witnessed 49.71% turnout but wards like Bakhtawarpur in north Delhi recorded the highest with 68.78% voting. In 2012, Bakhtawarpur had the highest share of voter turnout—68%. Affluent areas like Civil Lines and Rajinder Nagar witnessed 49.7% and 48.61% turnout respectively.

  In north corporation, most wards recorded 50%-60% of voting. Only seven wards — mostly from outer areas and unauthorised colonies — witnessed over 60% of polling.
  

  

  In the east, Sundar Nagri recorded the highest polling — 63.92%. Eight wards recorded more than 60% of voting and all of them have a large number of unauthorised colonies and slum clusters. Areas like Mayur Vihar, Patparganj and Preet Vihar just crossed the 50% mark. Shakurpur was the only ward to have a turnout below 50%.

  Election officials claim that weather too had role in the low turnout in some areas. But many people from urban localities didn't cast votes at all. RWAs claim that they urged people in their area to cast their vote. Kapil Kakkar, RWA president of Jangpura Extension, said that a circular was sent out in this connection.
  

  

  ""We requested people to opt for NOTA if they were dissatisfied with any party. It is important to give a message to the political parties for not taking voters seriously,"" Kakkar said.

  Justice A K Pathak said an order for use of VVPAT (Voter-verified paper audit trail)-enabled Generation 2 or Generation 3 electronic voting machines (EVBMs) cannot be issued at the eleventh hour as it would amount to stalling the election process.
  

  

  The plea, filed by the AAP as also by Mohd Tahir Hussain who is a candidate in the MCD elections, has contended that the EVMs to be used in the polls were obsolete and open to tampering.
  

  

  During the arguments before dismissing the plea, the court asked the state election commission of Delhi why it did not opt for VVPAT EVMs in view of the Supreme Court's observation in Subramanium Swamy's case that such machines should be brought into use in a phased manner.
  

  

  In its arguments, the Delhi poll panel said the question raised by the AAP on the use of EVMs in the MCD polls was sending a wrong message to the voters."
"Smaller players bet big on their poll chances","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/smaller-players-bet-big-on-their-poll-chances/articleshow/58321292.cms","NEW DELHI: Even as Congress, BJP and AAP have been getting the maximum political footage this municipal election, there are other smaller players that have been slowly but steadily trying to grab a bite of the poll pie.
  

  

  JD(U), Swaraj India, BSP and SP are the more well-known among these smaller players, but there are some nondescript parties that are contesting too. Their size hasn't prevented them from aiming big, though. They have projected themselves as alternatives to the three bigger parties by holding many rallies, public meets and road shows.
  

  

  Yogendra Yadav's Swaraj India will make its electoral debut. But it has not been a smooth ride for the debutante, as it was denied a common election symbol followed by rejection of nomination of 24 candidates. Its candidates are contesting on 211 seats with women candidates fighting on 111 seats. Contesting as Independent, the candidates have got a common symbol of whistle.
  

  

  Swaraj India ran a high-pitched campaign, attacking all parties for their failure in delivering on promises. The party says that local issues have been central to its election campaign. ""Unlike other political parties, we have focused on local issues. We have presented our vision document before the people,"" said Anupam, spokesperson of Swaraj India.
  

  

  JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar invoked the issue of full statehood to Delhi to attract Delhi voters while appealing to Bihari pride at the same time. JD(U) has fielded mostly Poorvanchalis. Even though the Bihar-based party doesn't have a strong foothold in Delhi, it has mounted a strong campaign in Poorvanchali areas by bringing politicians from Bihar.

  ""The crowd at Nitish Kumar rallies and road shows indicated that we are going to win big,"" claimed Sanjay Jha, JD(U) general secretary and Delhi in-charge. JD(U) has fielded 101 candidates—50% of them women—many of whom are Poorvanchalis.
  

  

  BSP has bigger stakes than JD(U) as it has 11 councillors at present. It has fielded 211 candidates across the corporations. The party's Delhi in-charge, Veerendra Singh Ashok, claimed BSP candidates have worked silently and the results would be big bang.
  

  

  Caste equations have been at play too. BSP has fielded 22 Brahmins, four Rajputs, 26 Muslims besides a significant number of Dalits and other castes. ""We have given representation to people from all castes and creed,"" Ashok said, adding that 120 of its candidates are women. However, BSP has had no popular campaigners.
  

  

  Samajwadi Party has fielded 29 candidates. The party has, just like BSP, deployed its UP workers in Delhi to campaign for it. However, former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav didn't campaign for candidates."
"Why the south Delhi rich are poor in casting their ballot","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/why-the-south-delhi-rich-are-poor-in-casting-their-ballot/articleshow/58321197.cms","NEW DELHI: It is a paradox: the affluent residential colonies that are more robustly covered by the RWA system are often the least interested in casting votes for the municipal corporations. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that residents of these colonies have the wherewithal to deal with civic problems even if the corporations ignore their complaints. In 2012, the burgeoning RWA movement had created a lot of interest in the civic bodies, and yet the turnout in these areas had been just around 45%. This Sunday, with the unusually hot weather and a general disillusionment with political parties, it would be interesting to watch the turnout in these areas.
  

  

  The voting percentage in the byelection for the Rajouri Garden assembly seat was 47%. That, however, can be attributed to a general trend in byelections. Wing Commander JS Chaddha (retd), who heads the RWA in East of Kailash and is the convenor of URJA (United Residents Joint Action), however, has doubts if the voters from the affluent colonies will turn up at the polling booths on Sunday. ""The problem is not about awareness but about the high level of frustration with the system,"" he said.

  Chetan Sharma, chairman of the Federation of GK2 RWAs, pointed out that in 2012 when the RWA movement was at a peak, the urban colonies had voted in greater numbers than earlier. Despite this, the turnout was less than 50%. ""The RWA movement has since got watered down, so it will definitely have an effect on this year's turnout,"" he said. He also attributed the lack of voter interest to the reluctance of the state election commission to involve the RWAs and citizen groups in election-related activities this time.
  

  

  The delimitation exercise, by geographically balancing the urban-rural presence in the wards, has further diluted the political relevance of votes from upscale colonies. Meena Gangahar, member of the Greater Kailash RWA, argued that the politicians considered jhuggi-jhopdi dwellers and urban villages as their vote banks. ""Our ward now has many JJ colonies and villages included in it. Their population provides the politicians with a reliable vote bank,"" she said. ""Why should we vote for leaders who will have nothing to do with our concerns?""
  

  

  Indeed, in 2012, the east Delhi region largely made up of unauthorised or regularised colonies and urban villages recorded the highest turnout. South Delhi, home to high-profile addresses, recorded the least. Perhaps the apathy also has to do with residents of affluent areas having access to power centres as well as the financial muscle to solve their problems with or without the intervention of their municipal councillor.

"Neglected areas vote loud and clear for change","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/neglected-areas-vote-loud-and-clear-for-change/articleshow/58333667.cms","NEW DELHI: In a historic turnout, the show was stolen by the city's poor and those who live on the peripheries of the urban centre. If Bakhtawarpur ward in Narela assembly constituency outdid everyone, registering the highest voter turnout of 69% among 270 wards, in a far corner of northeast Delhi, Sunder Nagri went all out to secure the second place and take the top slot in east with 63.62% .
  

  

  Sunder Nagri is the place from where chief minister Arvind Kejriwal led the RTI movement for the rights of the poor in the slums under the banner of Parivartan. The area is marked by a significant population living in slums. The highest overall turnout of about 56% registered in east Delhi too reveals that unauthorized colonies, resettlements and slums have come out strongly to have a say in the way the city will be run.
  

  

  In south, the highest turnout was registered in Madipur at 61.6%. Clearly, here too, the marginals may prove to be decisive with the voters living in unauthorized colonies, urban and rural villages and slums.
  

  

  Interestingly, in the Rajouri Garden ward, which is in the Rajouri Garden assembly constituency, the turnout was 48.83%. This assembly constituency saw a bypoll on April 9 with a low voter turnout of 47%. BJP won the seat.
  

  

  Tagore Garden, with a significant middle class presence, registered a turnout of 54.35% while in Punjabi Bagh it was 55.94%. On the periphery, Burari recorded 55.75%, Narela 56.22 % and Rohini 50.83%.
  

  

  Lack of sanitation and public toilets, poor quality of civic services and missing civic infrastructure seem to have forced people of east Delhi to turn out in large numbers and vote for ""change"".

  In the area's villages like Chilla and slum clusters in Trilokpuri, Mustafabad, Sunder Nagri, Shahdara etc, close to 25-30% votes were cast by noon and people stood in long queues waiting for their turn. ""This vote is for change. From public toilets to colony roads, everything is in a pathetic condition. In the past two years, we have suffered a lot due to the strike by sanitation workers. Why can't our areas be maintained like the south Delhi ones,"" asked Satprakash, a resident of Ramesh Park. However, in well-developed areas like Mayur Vihar and Patparganj, residents trickled in slowly through the day.
  

  

  For lakhs of sanitation workers employed with the three municipal corporations, the main issue was ""getting salary on time"". Mahesh Kumar, a sanitation worker with the east corporation, said that he had to pull out his children from a private school and admit them in a government school as he couldn't pay the fees on time. ""I paid a fine for one year, but now I can't afford to do that. For the past two years, we have not been getting salaries on time. I want a party in corporation which can ensure that sanitation workers get salaries on time,"" said Kumar, a resident of Trilokpuri.
  

  

  Meanwhile, the upscale colonies of south Delhi warmed up to the process very slowly. A polling centre in Deshbandhu College at Kalkaji had 8% turnout till 10 am. A similar general sense of apathy was visible in the affluent localities lke GK1, GK2 and CR Park in the morning. Polling officers at CR Park's B Block polling station said they recorded an 11.5% turnout in the first two hours. In stark contrast, the neighbouring Govindpuri and Okhla had hundreds of people waiting outside polling stations to get their voter slips prepared.
  

  

  In minority-dominated areas like Okhla's Shaheen Bagh, too, there was an impressive turnout as people - including many women -- continued to pour in even in the afternoon. A few yards from the historic Red Fort in Jama Masjid ward, too, many Muslim women came out to cast their vote."

It becomes clear after TOI spoke with several locals that caste linkages play a key role in the high turnout in this ward comprising over a dozen villages with 55,000 voters. Bakhtawarpur is the big gest village in the ward and located at the centre. Bhule Ram Chauhan, 70, an ex-serviceman and former pradhan, says that enthusiasm and interest for elections has always been a unique feature of the area.
  

  

  ""Even when I contested in 1983, a huge percentage of peo 1983, a huge percentage of people voted. I remember even a pregnant lady was carried to the booth on a cot. It is largely because of the community feeling here. The village has a large number of Chauhans and all families are like relatives in an extended family .And if you don't vote, it becomes a matter of ulahana (grouse),"" he says.
  

  

  Locals estimate that Chauhans make at least 50% of the population. Jats are second in number. Much of the voting happens on caste lines. The previous two councillors from the Bakhtawarpur seat, Rita and Sharad, were Chauhans too. Even this year, all major parties -AAP , Congress and BJP -fielded Chauhans as candidates. Says BJP candidate Sunit Chauhan, ""My ri vals from AAP and Congress are close relatives. Brotherhood has kept Bakhtawarpur a notch above the other areas.""

  Shahid Saifi, 48, a resident from neighbouring village Akbarpur Majra, says intercaste rivalry is also a strong factor in every election. ""The alluvial Yamuna khadar region has a large number of Chauhans and Jats. Both communities want their candi date to win and cajole a large number of people to turn out.Political parties here are irrelevant. Caste is the defining factor. The last councillor belonged to the BSP even though party doesn't have much pres ence in this ward. He was a Chauhan too,"" he says.
  

  

  Largely an agricultural village, Bakhtawarpur has lush green fields. Despite being located in a distant corner of the capital near the Delhi UP-Haryana border, the basic civic infrastructure seems to be in place. Vehicle ownership too is high. Electrician Rajesh Kumar explains how vehicles were roped in to ferry people to the booths.

  ""People in posh urban areas don't even know their neighbours. Here even the marriage invitation goes out to the entire village. The whole family goes out to vote together making the turnout really high,"" he says.
  

  

  Bakhtawarpur, though, continues to have some basic problems. One of them is the absence of a proper healthcare facility . The drainage system too is inadequate. ""The MCD dispensary is poorly equipped and the nearest hospital is 10km away at Narela.We need a good healthcare facility or at least a polyclinic in case of an emergency ,"" says Karan Singh, who runs a shop that sells agricultural equipment."

  SEC officials had a hard time compiling the polling percentages at regular intervals as there was a delay in receiving the data from the polling centres.
  

  

  ""There was a delay on the part of the officials concerned in sending the polling percentage data to the control room set up at the SEC headquarters. It has been decided to issue memos to those responsible for it,"" said an official.
  

  

  SEC officials suspect that poor Internet connectivity at the polling centres led to the delay in transmitting the data to the control room.
  

  

  ""There could have been issues with the Internet at the returning officers' end. Such a problem had never surfaced before,"" said an official.
  

  

  Voting to elect the municipal councillors commenced at over 13,000 polling stations across the national capital at 8 AM amid tight security arrangements.

  Of the 13,022 polling stations, the police had declared 3,284 as 'sensitive' and 1,464 as 'hyper-sensitive'.
  

  

  For the first time, the 'None Of The Above' (NOTA) option was made available in the MCD polls.
  

  

  A total of 1,32,10,206 voters, including over 1.1 lakh first-time voters, were entitled to exercise their franchise to elect councillors for the 270 wards under the three civic bodies -- NDMC (103 wards), SDMC (104) and EDMC (63).

  civic polls in Delhi+
  .
  

  

  In most upscale colonies, the turnout was very low till 11am. For instance, in some polling stations in Mayur Vihar phase-I, the turnout was 10-12% whereas it was close to 25% in the neighbouring Chilla village by noon.
  

  

  Santosh, a resident of Trilokpuri, said it was a much-needed election as there had been no development in the area for several years. ""Sanitation is a serious problem here. People want change. We want someone who can address our problem,"" she said.
  

  

  In upscale south Delhi colonies like Greater Kailash I and II, Vasant Kunj, Panchsheel Enclave, Safdarjung Enclave and Vasant Vihar, residents trickled in slowly through the day. In a stark contrast to this, Govindpuri, a slum cluster near GK, had hundreds of people waiting outside the polling station at Sant Nirankari school to get their voter slips. ""It is just 11am and we have already seen 20% of polling,"" an election official said.
  

  

  People in JJ clusters, slums and unauthorised colonies complained that the problems in their areas were very serious and councillors had done little to address them in the past few years. ""Maximum campaigning happens in our areas, but when it comes to work nobody listens to us,"" said Manoj Vajpayee, a resident of Ramesh Park in east Delhi.

  Ram Kishan, a resident of Govindpuri, has similar grievances. ""Only 10% of houses here have toilets. Women have to go to the nearby jungles to relieve themselves. We don't have regular supply of water. We need a strong councillor to address our problems. People in Greater Kailash and other posh areas can straightaway call the officers if they have slightest of discomfort. But no one will listen to us,"" said Ram Kishan.
  

  

  North Delhi areas like Civil Lines witnessed a poor voter turnout even till 3pm whereas in Burari and Mangolpuri, which have a high percentage of rural pockets and slums, people turned up in large numbers to vote for a ""change"". Voters said these areas were facing a number of civic problems and the elections were a good way to improve the condition and tell political parties that they can't run away from their responsibilities. ""The voter turnout has been very good despite the heat. Over 17% had cast their votes by 11am,"" said an official at a polling station in Burari.
  

  

  Areas like Khyala saw a high voter turnout while poll percentage was dismal in places like Rajouri Garden, Tagore Garden and Karol Bagh. ""Sanitation has always been a problem and we want to vote for candidate who looks promising and can solve the issues of our ward,"" said Raju, a resident of Khyala.
  

  

  In many upscale colonies, people didn't come out to cast vote as they believed this election results won't affect them. Sushila Rawat came to vote around 2pm in Dhaula Kuan. An MNC employee, Rawat blamed the heat for the below average turnout in the afternoon."

However, amid the excitement anxiety was writ large on the faces of AAP and Congress given the fact that exit polls have given a clean sweep to BJP.
  

  

  Tiwari took the opportunity of the two-day gap between polling and counting to fly to Mumbai and shoot a movie. He returned on Tuesday morning to take stock of the preparations of the state unit for the counting day. He met party members at his North Avenue residence and then went to Parliament to attend a meeting of standing committee on shipping.
  

  

  A cricket enthusiast, Tiwari played the sport in the lawn of his residence in the evening to relax and prepare for the civic poll results that may shape his political career in the party.
  

  

  Ajay Maken spent the day conducting meetings. He met district presidents to get their feedback on the municipal elections. In the evening, he met Congress spokespersons and advised them to keep the party's position in the media strongly on Wednesday.
  

  

  The exit polls have not been favourable for Congress. Aspiring to make a comeback in the corporations, the party came up with a detailed manifesto and roped in senior party functionaries in campaigns. It fielded many new faces and gave an impressive representation to women.

  Though the party had to fight defections, it always put up a strong face before the public. The results will show whether Congress maintains the growth in voting percentage it received during the Rajouri Garden bypoll or loses the momentum.
  

  

  Kejriwal met party functionaries at his residence to discuss the civic polls. He expressed apprehension that EVMs may spoil AAP's prospects and threatened to launch an agitation if the outcome of the polls was what the exit polls have suggested.

"BJP to sweep Delhi civic elections, predict 2 surveys","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/bjp-to-sweep-delhi-civic-elections-predict-2-surveys/articleshow/58307118.cms","NEW DELHI: Two opinion polls on the eve of the
  municipal polls+
  in Delhi have projected a
  sweep for the BJP+
  in all three corporations, with one giving the party that is now in office 195 out of the 272 seats and the other 179. The two polls placed AAP at a distant second at 55 and 45 seats respectively and the Congress even further back.
  

  

  While the poll done by VMR for Times Now did not give a break-up of its seat projection for the three corporations, its tally of 195 for the BJP clearly implies comfortable wins in all three. The CVoter poll done for ABP News forecast that the BJP would win 76 of the 104 seats in the North corporation, 60 of 104 in the South and 43 of 64 in the East.
  

  

  
    Might of crores versus spirit of ‘ordinary’: Who’ll win?Some municipal seats have gaping financial disparities. In Sadar Bazar, Mohammad Usman, the Congress nominee with assets of Rs 57 crore, is taking on Naveen Sharma, an independent with a less than Rs 35,000.

  AAP, this poll estimated, would win 13 seats in the North, 21 in the South and 11 in the East. The Times Now poll put the Congress tally for all three corporations combined at just 15, while the ABP News poll gave it 26 seats consisting of eight each in the North and East and 10 in the South.
  

  

  The ABP News poll gave the BJP a vote share of 41.9%, which would mean a near repeat of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. For AAP, the projected 27.5% in this poll would mean a massive comedown from the nearly 55% it won in the 2015 assembly polls.
  

  

  Interestingly, both polls suggested that the decisive mandate for BJP would be despite a high level of dissatisfaction with the performance of the corporation in the last ten years when the party has been in office. The Times Now poll estimated that the satisfaction levels with the Delhi government are higher than with MCD.
  

  

  This seems to vindicate the BJP's strategy of fighting these elections primarily in the name of the prime minister and points to a failure by AAP and Congress to get voters focused on municipal issues and the perceived non-performance of the corporations."

BJP claimed that the step confirmed that ""Congress is disintegrating"" in the city.
  

  

  After pledging his unconditional support to BJP in front of party president Amit Shah, Lovely said, ""I am pained and angry at the way I have been treated by the party (Congress) in which I worked for 31 years. I could not tolerate more humiliation.""
  

  

  Referring to the displeasure expressed by another former Congress minister, AK Walia, over ticket distribution, Lovely said, ""If senior functionaries like A K Walia can be sidelined, it is pointless to be here. I felt unwanted and unheard as I struggled to meet Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi."" He addded that he wanted to convey his concerns regarding the way Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee was being run.
  

  

  On his choice of BJP, the former Gandhinagar MLA said, ""Both PM Narendra Modi and Shah work tirelessly day and night to deliver honest governance. I want to work for a party like this. I have come here at a time when there is no election, so I am not here for power.""

""He felt suffocated in Congress,"" said Girri. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said, ""Lovely will help strengthen BJP's base in east Delhi areas"".

"People find faith in Congress again: Ajay Maken","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/people-find-faith-in-cong-again-maken/articleshow/58277555.cms","NEW DELHI: Buoyed by his party's performance in the Rajouri Garden bypolls, where it finished second but had a significantly higher vote share than 2015, DPCC president Ajay Maken feels the civic polls will be a fight between Congress and BJP.
  

  

  Maken believes Congress will have an edge, irrespective of the recent infighting in its ranks, and AAP would cease to be a factor. ""Congress will be the dark horse. Mark my words, people will vote for solutions. They are fed up with the everyday bickering between the Delhi and central governments. People know that Congress has the capacity to give solutions and work on them,"" Maken told TOI in an interview.
  

  

  The DPCC chief is upbeat about getting votes. ""We have brought together the best brains in Congress to come out and give global solutions to local problems of municipal governance. So, when we go to the people we tell them to vote for Congress as that's like voting for a set of solutions,"" he said.

  So, what are these solutions? ""If we plug the leakages in the municipal revenue system, then the civic bodies don't need any financial assistance from the state or Centre to survive. For instance, municipal corporations have huge land banks that are currently encroached upon. These can be turned into critical income generating resources. Streamlining of primary healthcare and education is required to ensure maximum benefit for the poor. We will streamline finances to ensure there are no strikes for want of wages. We will clear pending arrears of Rs 1,563 crore due to sanitation workers,"" Maken said.
  

  

  The hike in its vote share, Congress feels, reflects its traditional voters—the poor and minorities—returning to its fold after abandoning it earlier for AAP. ""The poor people don't see AAP as a factor because of non-delivery of promises and over exaggeration of achievements. These two things have hurt the poor the most,"" he said.
  

  

  Maken also said the recent protests by A K Walia and Mangat Ram Singhal over ticket distribution would have no impact on Congress's performance. ""In- house factionalism and groupism is not new in Congress; it has always been there since Congress was created,"" Maken said.
  

  

  Without commenting on the Congress old guard in Delhi, Maken said he was ""trying to create a Congress with a new thinking"", and that he had been given a free hand by the party brass to work on the new strategies he has chalked out for the party. ""We want young people to be more and more involved in strategic planning and giving solutions,"" he said."

The decision comes a day after AAP attacked BJP for using Kumar in its campaigns.

  The move comes after Delhi government's Health Department approached the State Election Commissioner urging him to declare all the polling stations as 'tobacco free zones' rather than just declaring them as 'smoke-free' as it used to be in earlier elections.
  

  

  In a letter to Commissioner S K Srivastava, Additional Director (Health) Dr S K Arora noted that since chew-able tobacco, a leading cause of oral cancer, is already banned in Delhi, the polling booths should be declared 'tobacco free'.
  

  

  The decision should be taken in larger public health interest, he stressed.
  

  

  The Commission has now sought cooperation of the Commissioners of all three civic bodies — South, North and East municipal corporation — to create 'tobacco free' poll booths for the MCD polls and display multi-colour banners at each location indicating the same.
  

  

  ""It is an excellent opportunity to sensitise nearly 1.33 crore adults on a single day as they will come to cast their vote at the polling booths,"" Dr Arora said.
  

  

  He said 90 per cent of oral cancers, 40 per cent of all cancers and 30 per cent of tuberculosis cases occur because of tobacco habits.
  

  

  Also, 20 per cent cases of diabetes, hypertension, heart attack and brain stroke are also linked to tobacco consumption, he added.
  

  

  The Health department will also provide signages/banners to be displayed at the entry gate of each polling booth.

  The banners will have content to educate people about the ill effects of tobacco consumption including smoking.
  

  

  The objective is also to make public aware that polling booths being a public place, the use and sale of all kinds of tobacco is prohibited, he said.
  

  

  Besides, teams of health departments will also supervise and monitor to ensure that there are no violations of the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) 2003.
  

  

  In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the Election Commission had asked the state election authorities to implement the no- smoke policy in accordance with the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003."

  Results of UP polls show that Congress and SP candidates were head to head on 22 assembly seats, seven of which the alliance could have won if it hasn't been for the their internal warring. While Congress has only won one of these - Kanpur Cantonment - the SP has won three. The remaining 18 seats were lapped up by BJP.
  

  

  The foremost example of the alliance's internal malfunction are the two high profile seats of Amethi and Lucknow Central. In Amethi, Congress' Ameeta Sinh and SP minister Gayatri Prajapati were pitted against BJP's Garima Sinh. The family feud between the two 'Ranis', Garima, the estranged wife of Congress leader Sanjay Sinh, and Ameeta, his current wife, gave the BJP an edge and allowed it to wrest the Congress stronghold. While Ameeta polled 20,291 votes, Prajapati polled 59,161 votes. Amethi winner Garima Sinh polled 64,226 votes. If Congress had not fielded Ameeta, the SP could have won the seat and saved the grand old party the blushes on its home turf.

  Lucknow Central saw a similar battle. Here, SP minister Ravidas Mehrotra finished second to BJP's Brajesh Pathak. If it hadn't been for Congress' Maroof Khan, who bagged over 12,000 votes, Mehrotra, who lost by over 5000 votes, could have won. The SP and Congress also pulled each other down in west UP's Gangoh seat where the contest between SP's Indrasen and Congress' Nauman Madood allowed BJP's Pradeep Kumar to walk away with the winner's certificate. On this seat, Congress polled 61,000 votes, while SP polled over 47,000 votes. Kumar, on the other hand, got a little over 99,000 votes.
  

  

  The Congress also lost the Sareni seat in the Gandhi bastion to bad seat management within the alliance. While Congress' Ashok Singh polled over 42,000 votes, SP MLA Devendra Pratap Singh got 32,792 votes.
  

  

  If only one or the other had contested, their cumulative total would have exceeded BJP winner Dhirendra Singh's vote count of 65,873. The Maharajpur seat in Kanpur, though, saw the worst instance of SP-Congress fight. BJP's Satish Mahana comfortably swept Maharajpur, but not before both the warring parties and their leaders exposed the differences to the public. While Congress's Rajaram Pal and SP's Aruna Tomar fought themselves, the SP-Congress leadership also appeared divided. Rahul and Akhilesh jointly campaigned for the Congress nominee, while Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav pitched for the SP candidate. In the end, while their cumulative tally was not enough to defeat Mahana, Pal and Tomar, polled 18,697 and 38,752 respectively, despite the confusion.
  

  

  It was much the same for Congress' Brijlal Khabri on the reserved Mehroni seat in Bundelkhand. Khabri and SP's Ramesh Khatik fought each other instead of the BJP. While Khatik polled over 27,000 votes, Khabri got 43,171 votes but the seat was won by BJP."

Lovely hit back, threatening to ensure a massive defeat for the Congress candidate at Rajouri Garden where Maken lives.
  

  

  Maken's Congress resurgence dream has now come under challenge from his once-close friend. In response to Maken's claim that Lovely's move won't impact the municipal poll outcome, BJP's new entrant said, ""I challenge Ajay Maken that I will ensure that the Congress candidate at Rajouri Garden loses by the highest margin. I challenge Maken that if he is a grassroots leader, he can try his best to prevent his candidate from losing.""
  

  

  The grapevine is abuzz that more Congressmen, dubbed as the 'old guard' feeling sidelined in Maken's 'new' Congress, are exploring options outside the party. So far the Congress top brass — high command Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi — have not made any statement to stem the turbulence in Delhi Congress.

  Responding to charges levelled by Lovely at a press conference on the Congress leadership earlier in the day, Maken told TOI, ""I will only say one thing, we will win in east Delhi."" Lovely had been an MLA from east Delhi's Gandhinagar and was known to have bolstered the party's performance in East Delhi parliamentary constituency that was represented by former chief minister Sheila Dikshit's son, Sandeep, for two terms.
  

  

  Congress sources said Maken's confidence stemmed from the fact that east Delhi still boasted of Congressmen who wielded much clout among voters. It is learnt that Maken is of the view that in the municipal polls, local factors would hold sway and Lovely's move won't impact the poll result. Senior leaders in the party admitted that if it were the assembly or parliamentary elections, the adverse impact would have been more acute.
  

  

  For Congress, the wards under East Delhi Municipal Corporation will now be a critical battlefield. However, Lovely's statements since joining BJP have made it clear that he won't sit idle in this last leg of campaigning. With just two days left for campaigning, Lovely may be seen at BJP's public meetings in different parts of the city. On Wednesday evening, there were already talks of organising a public meeting for Lovely in east Delhi.
  

  

  Meanwhile, Maken claimed that the infighting and restlessness among a section of Congress members would in no way impact Congress' poll campaign. ""We are doing public meets and taking our message to the people. All workers and candidates are in the field,"" he said."
"MCD polls: Congress vows boost to urban infrastructure","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/cong-vows-boost-to-urban-infra/articleshow/58277717.cms","New Delhi: Congress on Tuesday released the second part of its manifesto for the municipal elections with a focus on urban infrastructure.
  

  

  Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Maken said if his party emerged victorious, it would exempt self-occupied residential properties and people above the age of 65 years from paying property tax. Explaining how the proposal was different from that announced by AAP, Maken said: ""Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has proposed to abolish property tax, which is not possible under the law. We propose to exempt only self-occupied residential properties and senior citizens above 65 years of age from paying property tax. The rest will be charged as usual.""

  Maken said every year the capital is submerged in water during monsoons. Congress, he said, would come up with a Summer Action Plan — by June-end, all drains would be desilted.
  

  

  ""We will also focus on setting up a rainwater harvesting system to recharge groundwater,"" Maken said. He proposed to empower residents welfare associations by ""streamlining"" the system. ""We will empower RWAs to maintain and run parking systems in their respective colonies. The money they collect can be used for their maintenance. Also, we will revive the bhagidari system for greater citizen participation in local governance."" A separate fund will be created for Chhath Puja, he added.
  

  

  The party promised to construct roads under the three corporations and put up dustbins — blue- and green-coloured — at every 750 metres. ""We will make a 100% switch from traditional asphalt to concrete roads to make them pothole-free. It will be cost-effective,"" said Maken.
  

  

  DPCC will release its third and final manifesto on Wednesday, which would have proposals to ""empower"" the youth. ""For the first time, we are coming up with a separate manifesto for the youth. It will aim to involve young minds in streamlining the system,"" said Maken."
"Myths of Muslim, Dalit and Jat votes busted","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/myths-of-muslim-dalit-and-jat-votes-busted-numbers-show-1st-two-groups-backed-sp-and-bsp-while-the-3rd-stood-by-bjp/articleshow/57639878.cms","Every election campaign throws up myths that get busted by the results. But then, the results themselves generate new myths. The recent
  UP Assembly elections+
  are no exception.
  

  

  Analysis of detailed results and comparison+
  to earlier elections show up the truth about three riddles and the myths that pose as their answers: what happened to the Muslim vote? What happened to the Dalit vote? And what happened to the Jat vote?
  

  

  Individual votes cannot be tracked, but voting trends in constituencies give an indication of where preferences of communities are heading.
  

  

  This can be useful to find answers to knotty sociopolitical questions.
  

  

  
  

  

  
    The Muslim Vote
    

  
  

  The campaign saw an intense battle between SP and BSP to win over Muslim votes which make up about 19% of the electorate.
  

  

  BJP's resounding victory, even in Muslim concentration areas, has led to speculation that, either the Muslim vote got divided between SP and BSP letting BJP win easily, or that Muslims voted for BJP. Both appear to be erroneous theories.
  

  

  SP (29%) and BSP (18%) together got 47% vote in the 59 constituencies in UP where more than a quarter of the voters are Muslim. This is virtually unchanged since 2012 elections, although it went down to 43% in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
  

  

  So, the Muslim support for the two parties is intact.
  

  

  
  

  

  

  The difference this time was that BJP mopped up most of the other votes — getting 39% of total votes.
  

  

  This was less than their 43% in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but still so far ahead of the rivals that they won 39 seats while SP won 17 and BSP ended up with none. SP's 29% vote share in these seats shows that its Muslim support base largely intact.
  

  

  The Dalit Vote
  

  

  There was a much hyped battle between BJP and BSP to win Dalit votes, especially non-Jatav Dalits. Dalits make up about 21% of the population in UP. Since BSP lost badly in the elections ending up with just 19 seats, there was a view that Dalits voted en masse for BJP.
  

  

  Actually, BSP has got 24% votes, down from its 27% in 2012 but up from 23% in 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
  

  

  Among the 85 reserved seats in the state, BJP outflanked all other parties by getting 40% of the votes with BSP a distant second at 24%.
  

  

  Again, BJP's appeal was across all castes and may have included some Dalit communities too, but BSP's vote share indicates that it is just about retaining its Dalit base while BJP surged ahead.
  

  

  The Jat Vote
  Hmt Ladies Designer Wrist WatchShopcluesDo you think term insurance isn't affordable?MAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  

  One big myth that the elections blew up was that of the Jats, a dominant community in western UP, deserting BJP after wholeheartedly supporting them in the previous 2014 election.
  

  

  In the 73 seats in Phase 1 of the polls, BJP's vote share increased from a mere 16% in 2012 to 45% in 2017 while RLD, led by Jat leader Ajit Singh, declined from 11% to just 6%. Vote shares of all other parties and even of independent candidates declined.
  

  

  This clearly indicates that the Jats had stood by BJP, just as they had during the Lok Sabha elections."
"BJP hits the ground running in UP for cheap power","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-hits-the-ground-running-in-up-for-cheap-power/articleshow/57635339.cms","NEW DELHI: The BJP has hit the ground running in UP to fulfil two of its key election promises -- to provide cheap power and free energy efficient pumps to farmers -- even before formally forming the government in the state.
  

  

  UP power secretary Sanjay Agarwal will hold a meeting in Lucknow on Wednesday for signing the Centre's 'Power for All', envisaging commitment to 24X7 power supply, connecting all households, supplying up to 100 units at Rs 3 for each household and giving free energy efficiency pumps to farmers.
  

  

  Though UP was one of the first states to accept 'Uday', the Centre's plan to rejuvenate debt-laden discoms, it refused to finalise the terms for signing the Power for All document, which commits states to improve power management and supply.
  

  

  This had been a sore point between the Centre and the state government and became a poll issue in the state, with BJP putting the blame on the Samajwadi Party government for the lethargic reforms and poor power service.
  

  

  From the Union power ministry's notice for the meeting, sent to all pertinent officials in the Centre and state, it is abundantly clear that the Lucknow meeting is being held on the prodding from the Centre. Though such prodding has not been uncommon in the past, this time it has worked to indicate a better synchronicity between the Central and state bureaucracies in future.
  

  

  With an overwhelming victory at the election, expectations of a rapid change in overall infrastructure and services in UP are running high.

  The logical conclusion of the Power for All document will give a head start to the state government and show the BJP's commitment towards its poll promises.
  

  

  Indeed. It will be one more proof that the Narendra Modigovernment's implementation of two energy schemes over the last two years in the state overtook the SP's outreach bandwagon and provided fuel for the BJP's juggernaut in the state.
  

  

  Speedy electrification of villages, combined with steps to improve power supply in the state, and distribution of free LPG connection to poor households brought about immediate and tangible improvement in the daily lives of beneficiaries.
  

  

  This established a connect with people about the PM's development politics plank."
"Repositioning identity politics Akhilesh's task","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/repositioning-identity-politics-akhileshs-task/articleshow/57614115.cms","NEW DELHI: One key feature of Akhilesh Yadav's extensive Uttar Pradesh campaign was that he did not mention Muslims or minorities from the dais. He did not refer to castes either. But the go-by to the almost mantra-like invocation of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav was calculated. It was also the reason behind the decision to veto the entry of the infamous Mukhtar Ansari clan into the Samajwadi Party.
  

  

  In the end, avoiding the M-word did not matter as a counter polarisation of Hindus, upper castes and OBCs powered BJP to an overwhelming win in the state.
  

  

  Jury is out if the Yadav scion's move was justified since it did not matter in stemming the Hindutva tide. The Muslim-Yadav combine, the force behind Mulayam for over two decades, seemed to be a trap this around.
  

  

  The ""Modi"" phenomenon has planted many doubts in the traditional politics of Uttar Pradesh where ""social justice"" outfits have ruled the roost with their ""base vote"".
  

  

  Taking the reins of SP just ahead of assembly polls, Akhilesh apparently put in practice a few lessons he learnt from the Lok Sabha decimation of 2014. As BJP romped the state with 73 seats in a wave set in motion by Modi's Hindutva-development plank, the SP GenNext appeared to have concluded that he needed to soften the identity politics by repositioning the party as an outfit wedded to ""development politics"".
  

  

  Avoiding crass references to identity was part of that plan, put in place after his hastily effected coup against the ""old guard"".
  

  

  The Yadav warlord disagreed and continued to push for sticking to the traditional formula, a reason why he backed the merger of Quami Ekta Dal of Ansaris. His belief was that the formula on which SP was founded could not be junked in a huff and any such move, if at all, had to be gradual.
  

  

  Irony, that while the now-former chief minister softened the politics which has proved the catalyst for BJP's Hindutva polarisation, the target constituency was not influenced and repeated its drift to the saffron camp.
  United Bag Fast Trip Grey and Black Casual Backpack UBK344ShopcluesDelight customers with a cognitive journeyIBMRecommended By Colombia

  

  As it seems now, Akhilesh was damned either way. BJP's was a shrewd combine of ""Mandal and Kamandal"" as, on evidence, the party appeared to have worked on a solid caste engineering besides pandering to the ""shamshan-kabristan"" sentiments.
  

  

  Crucially, Bahujan Samaj Party, desperate to counter SP's strategy to mobilise Muslims under its banner through an alliance with ""secular"" leader Congress, could not exercise caution. Mayawati repeated an appeal to Muslims to avoid SP and vote for it in every speech.
  

  

  During the campaign, many politicians and observers pointed out that her aggressive wooing of the Muslims was alienating her own ""most backward"" base because of the latter's alternative option in BJP. It also put minorities in the overt matrix, a factor that helps BJP in driving home its message of Hindutva.
  

  

  Now, with rebuilding their parties as their prime agenda after the electoral carnage, it would be interesting how Akhilesh and Mayawati walk the tight rope of wooing minorities while ensuring it does not cement the reverse polarisation on which BJP is thriving."

  At a public meeting organised near the Ghazipur landfill site, senior Congress functionary Jairam Ramesh claimed that during his tenure as Union environment minister, he had ""left no stone unturned to close the landfills in Narela-Bawana, Bhalswa, Okhla and Ghazipur, but directives sent by his ministry were ignored by the BJP-led corporations"".
  

  

  Flanked by local Congress workers, Ramesh said: ""The presence of such sites in the capital is a disgrace not only for the incumbent government, but also for the society as a whole. It risks the health of residents."". Delhi has four landfill sites and three of them - Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla - have exceeded their life span."

  Ending his 31-year association with Congress, the former MLA, who was seen enthusiastically campaigning for the party even on Monday evening along with star campaigner Raj Babbar, said that despite being a former Delhi Congress chief, he learnt about the manifesto release through media. He felt ""angry and pained"" at the way he was treated, said the former minister.
  

  

  A strong Sikh face of Delhi Congress, Lovely was seen as a heavyweight in east Delhi, who had been credited with a major role in several Congress victories during the three-term rule of Sheila Dikshit. Expressing her ""shock and pain"", Dikshit said on Tuesday, ""I hope he (Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken) learns some lessons from this very painful development."" The former chief minister has not been seen anywhere during the municipal campaign.

  The growing tussle between the old guard and the perception of a 'new-thinking' Congress under Maken has intensified since the announcement of candidates. After former minister A K Walia threatened to resign, another ex-minister, Mangat Ram Singhal, slammed the distribution process at a news conference. Former MP Sandeep Dikshit, too, has often criticised Maken's leadership.
  

  

  At a rally in Saraswati Vihar on Tuesday, Maken said, ""BJP has not done anything in the past 10 years of their rule in the corporations and now they are trying to break our party. We don't know why Lovely left the party but we are deeply saddened by the news.""
  

  

  He said, ""We all are in a party because we believe in its motive and ideology. One may hold a position today but tomorrow we may not hold it but that shouldn't change our belief. Party is everything for us and we should not become greedy.""
  

  

  Claiming Lovely didn't think about the party, Maken said, ""Lovely was the youngest minister in our party and remained so for 10 years. He was given the charge of Delhi Congress but today he has forgotten what the party has done for him. What can I say?"""

"Karol Bagh voters yearn for toe space","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/karol-bagh-voters-yearn-for-toe-space/articleshow/58277535.cms","NEW DELHI: Many would perhaps envy the three municipal wards of Karol Bagh assembly constituency for their commercial viability. They are after all home to popular commercial nerve centres like Ajmal Khan Road for general shopping, Ghaffar Market for electronics and Paharganj for its conglomerate of affordable hotels. The reality for residents is that all these contribute to the area's almost insurmountable problem: congestion.
  

  

  For the voters in the three North Delhi Municipal Corporation wards of Paharganj, Karol Bagh and Dev Nagar, almost all issues that require attention are related to congestion arising from vehicular presence, illegal parking, encroachments and proliferation of street vendors. Residents admit there are problems with sanitation and stray dogs, but these appear tame in the context of congestion. ""It is almost impossible even to drive our children to school,"" said Shobha at Multani Dhanda in Paharganj.
  

  

  Motia Khan businessman Sadanand Vaish blames no one in particular for the mess. ""Residents and shopkeepers indulge in encroachment, even as the local populace is increasingly turning homes into hotels and shops. These are choking the area to death."" Vaish's woes are supplemented by the corporation's decade-long failure to complete the Rani Jhansi Road flyover and Shastri Park multilevel parking, both of which could have eased the vehicle load from the area.

  ""Yes, we agree that tenders for the Shastri Park multilevel parking project have been floated multiple times, but contractors refuse to participate because of the poor financial status of the north corporation,"" conceded Yogender Chandolia, former mayor and councillor from Dev Nagar. ""Even the public-private participation mode didn't interest anyone.""
  

  

  There is a large SC population in the area — Dev Nagar, for instance, has more than 44,000 SCs among its 64,000 residents — and Chandolia blames Delhi government for depriving many of the benefits of its many SC welfare schemes, especially women and widows. But there is no escaping that the corporation itself hasn't done much to deal with the pressing problems. Chandolia identified water and congestion as the wards' twin bugbears. ""Water doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the corporation,"" he argued, ""and a councillor alone cannot do anything about congestion. Pedestrianisation, like the one being experimented with in Connaught Place, cannot be replicated here because the localities are mixed market-residential areas.""
  

  

  Kamlesh Rana recalled how Dev Nagar was a peaceful locality 40 years ago, but had now become unsuitable for residential life due to a preponderance of commercial buildings and heavy vehicles. In Paharganj, Anita Devi shuddered, ""The public toilets are all overflowing and the stink is unbearable."" Unforgivable perhaps for a place that attracts lodgers and shoppers in hordes.
  

  

  Madhu Khurana, Congress candidate from Paharganj and sitting member, deflected the blame to the BJP-led civic body. ""Nothing has been done in the last five years,"" she alleged. ""The Rani Jhansi Road flyover was started 15 years ago when I was a member of MCD, but has not been finished even now."" Her party, she claimed, would come up with a comprehensive plan to make free the wards of congestion."

Since 1969, the party which wins the seat in Sadar, forms the government in Uttar Pradesh. And 2017 assembly elections were no different when BJP candidate Sitaram in Sadar recorded his win, the BJP finally made a landslide victory in UP with 325 seats, finally ending its 15 year 'vanvaas'.
  

  

  From Congress in 1969 to SP in 2012, all parties which eventually formed the government after elections had conquered this seat which was called Jaisinghpur before delimitation in 2009. In 2017, BJP's Sitaram won by 18,773 votes defeating BSP's Raj Prasad Upadhyay. SP's Arun Verma who won in 2012 assembly elections ended third by winning 49,692 votes.
  

  

  The spell of luck for this seat started in 1969 when Sheo Kumar won from Congress and Congress formed the government. Kumar repeated the feat in 1974 and the Congress retained power.

  In 1977, when the Janata wave swept across the country , Jaisinghpur, too, elected a Janata Party candidate-Maqbool Husain Khan. In Lucknow, Congress was deposed.
  

  

  However, in 1980, the seat again went back to Congress. While its candidate Devendra Pandey snatched it from the Janata Party , Congress came back to power. It was a Congress winner and Congress government in 1985, too. However, Jaisinghpur elected a Janata Dal candidate in 1989 and the party formed the government.
  

  

  The seat went to BJP for the first time in 1991 and the saffron party formed its maiden government. His government fell after Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 and in the bypolls held the next year, the people Jaisinghpur elected SP candidate A Raish. After the elections, SP formed the government in coalition with BSP . In 1996 assembly elections, BSP candidate Ram Ratan Yadav won the seat and results saw a fractured mandate. However, after six months, BSP and BJP formed their first coalition government. The party retained the seat in 2002 elections and it was a BSP-BJP government again in the state.Continuing with its strange `winning' trend, the constituency elected a BSP candidate in 2007 and SP's Verma in 2012.

  The minister took a dig at Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for his allegation about the tampering of voting machines. ""The election commission has given an open challenge, so why doesn't he go and prove his charge?"" she said. It is not the EVMs that are tampered, she continued, it is the people who have had a change of heart.
  

  

  Unfazed by the Supreme Court's decision to reinstate criminal conspiracy charges against her and other BJP leaders in the Babri Masjid case, Bharti told the small crowd, ""Where was the conspiracy... everything happened in the open. We don't believe we did anything wrong.""
  

  

  Praising PM Narendra Modi for ""instilling confidence in the people of India"" and starting schemes like Jan Dhan that benefited a lot of people, Bharti criticised Congress for leaving the country in a mess with its ""poor policy decisions"".

Further, only 24 Muslim candidates could win elections. Results declared on Saturday also indicated that SP-Congress alliance was the first choice of Muslims despite Mayawati going all out to woo minority community.
  

  

  The BSP gave tickets to 99 Muslim candidates, highest ever by any mainstream party in UP since Independence. She also got Mukhtar Ansari's Quami Ekta Dal merged with the BSP and took support from Muslim-dominated Rashtriya Ulama Council. Several Muslim outfits also appealed in BSP's favour. However, results show that of 140 assembly constituencies where Muslim population is 20% or above, BJP won 109 and its ally Apna Dal 2, SP won 23 and its ally Congress 3, while BSP got 2. This pollsters said indicates Muslims chose SP-Congress alliance over BSP.

  These 140 seats are said to be key in winning UP elections. In 2012, when SP came to power with majority, it won 72 at constituencies, BSP 27 seats, BJP 25, Congress 11, RLD 1 and others four. In 2007, BSP had swept 40% of the total seats and also won elections.
  

  

  Though Muslims constitute 19% of UP's population, this time there will be drastic drop in their representation in the state assembly with only 24 (6% of the total 403 seats) candidates from the community winning elections. In 2012, total 69 Muslim candidates (17.12%), highest since independence, reached assembly and in 2007, 46% (11.90%). In 2012 and 2007, caste equations dominated elections, besides other issues. The lowest Muslim representation in state assembly was 16 (4.05% of the total 419 seats then) in 1991 when communal polarization took place due to Ram Temple movement and BJP came to power for the first time in the state with absolute majority. In 1993, in the elections held after Babri mosque demolition, only 24 (5.92%) Muslim candidates won.
  

  

  Analysts said that Muslim representation always comes down whenever there is polarization on religious lives. In 1967 and 1969 when Gau Rakshan movement was at its peak, only 23 Muslims won elections on both occasions in UP.
  

  

  In this elections, Mayawati's political engineering to bring together Dalit and Muslims failed as only five Muslim candidates out of total 99 fielded by the BSP, could win their seats. SP had given tickets to 57 Muslims, of which 17 won, while Congress fielded 22 Muslims, of which only two won. In 2012, of 78 Muslim candidates fielded by SP, 43 won, while of 85 Muslims fielded by BSP, 16 won. Congress gave tickets to 62 Muslims, but four won. Two Muslims candidates won on Quami Ekta Dal."

  The party has instructed its MLAs to campaign in every ward. Kejriwal himself has been holding two public meetings every day — in Patel Nagar and Moti Nagar on Sunday. The hoardings and posters, which carry the picture of Kejriwal from the time when AAP was given the 'broom' symbol, were seen in Punjabi Bagh, Kalindi Kunj, Mayur Vihar, Akshardham flyover, along the NH-24 and many other places.
  

  

  AAP's Delhi convener Dilip Kumar Pandey said, ""Garbage is all over the roads and dhalaos are overflowing. One of the main responsibilities of the corporations is to keep Delhi clean...but BJP did not do its duty and has turned the city into a garbage bin.""
  

  

  AAP's chief poll plank is cleanliness. Party members have been going around the city telling people that they will deliver and transform the sanitation system if voted to power, just like they delivered on their promises of free water and electricity at half rate. They claimed that the results of the Rajouri Garden poll will not reflect on the party's performance in the civic polls, adding that the people of Delhi are disappointed with BJP. They also said that the Rajouri Garden voters were upset with them because MLA Jarnail Singh had quit to contest the assembly election in Punjab.
  

  

  The party workers have been asked to connect with voters in all the wards and monitor booth management. They have also been asked to organise more events to woo voters."

  Under the leadership of Rahul and Maken, she alleged on Thursday, the party has only used the issue of empowerment of women and their security to gather votes but it means nothing to them. ""Maken, Rahul Gandhi's nominee in the party, misbehaved, not only with me but also with several other office-bearers of Delhi Mahila Congress. The same was brought to the notice of Rahul Gandhi, but our plea fell on deaf ears.""
  

  

  Terming the party hypocrite, she said while the party expected women Congress workers to protest against BJP's Vinay Katiyar for making absurd remarks about Priyanka Gandhi, ""we were told by Alankar Sawai in his office that we should take up the matter (of misbehaviour) with Maken himself"".
  

  

  Congress is suffering under the ineffective leadership of Rahul, who is ""mentally unfit"" to run the party, said Singh. ""Why is he hiding? Why is he scared of meeting his own party members? Several senior leaders have quit the party because of his reluctance to address issues within the organisation. He is only interested in meeting sycophants."" It is because of this attitude of both Rahul and Maken that ""five district and 75 block presidents have resigned"", she claimed.
  

  

  However, she made it clear that she would remain a ""loyal soldier"" of Congress. ""But in the current organisation where I myself feel unsafe, how will I empower women in it? That's why I am resigning from the post,"" she said."
"AAP didn’t keep promises: Vijender Gupta","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/aap-didnt-keep-promises-vijender-gupta/articleshow/58277637.cms","NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition Vijender Gupta on Monday picked holes in the main theme of AAP's municipal poll campaign, Jo Kaha So Kiya. On the basis of information sought through RTI from the AAP-led Delhi government, the BJP leader claimed that it had failed to keep 14 major promises — Jan Lokpal, WiFi, CCTV in buses and public places, corruption among others — made during the 2015 assembly elections.
  

  

  The Kejriwal government has accepted its total failure, Gupta said, in implementing the 70-point action plan. ""Directorate of Vigilance took general measures to reduce corruption. Jan Lokpal Bill had procedural lapses which were not corrected."" No unauthorised colony has been regularised since January 1, 2015, though lakhs were wooed with that carrot during the elections, said Gupta.
  Earton WomenGirl Tan Sports Running ShoesShopcluesWondering if you need term insurance?MAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  

  The government has done nothing for higher education as well and only Rs 1.5 crore out of the annual Rs 10-crore funds has been spent in the past two years, he claimed. ""Even the sites for new colleges have not been decided. Neither any fund has been earmarked nor any administrative sanction has been given."" It has also failed to regularise 17,000 guest teachers and fill up 13,000 posts in its schools, he claimed.
  

  

  Only seven CCTV cameras for Rs 29,000 have been installed in Delhi against the estimated requirement of 1 lakh cameras in public places. ""Not a single camera has been installed in any housing society, college or market,"" Gupta said, adding that 100 out of 4,200 buses have got CCTVs. The government has also admitted that it is still in the process of taking approvals to set up WiFi facilities.
  

  

  On health front, only two primary health centres have been opened against the promised 900. Although AAP showcases mohalla clinics as a ""success"" story, Gupta said, ""There is no action plan for providing health cards.""
  

  

  AAP's Delhi convener, Dilip Pandey, termed Gupta's allegations as an extension of mudslinging ahead of the elections. ""The allegations have been made by a person whose party is running corporations that are neck-deep in corruption,"" he said, adding that Gupta's wife, a councillor, has been asked by Central Information Commission to explain why ineligible applicants were recommended for pension."

"If EVMs aren’t tampered with, AAP will get over 200 seats in civic polls, says Kejriwal","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/i-feel-that-if-evms-arent-tampered-with-aap-will-get-over-200-seats-in-civic-polls-says-kejriwal/articleshow/58277702.cms","Faced with a determined BJP and a resurgent Congress, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tells TOI that only AAP can rid the corporations of corruption, raises questions over use of EVMs and impartiality of election commissioners and accuses LG Anil Baijal of unfair leaks.
  

  

  Q: The use of EVMs has become a big issue and you have even sought postponement of the civic polls so that VVPAT could be used. Do you seriously think the corporation elections will be rigged?
  

  

  A: There are just three or four countries in the world that use EVMs for national level elections. The rest of the world uses ballot papers. Germany used EVMs and then moved back to ballot papers. US switched to EVMs for two years and then went back to ballot papers. The experience of most of the world has been that the hardware and software can be easily tampered with. So, it is wrong to say that the EVMs are tamper-proof. They ask how is it possible to influence such a huge administrative machinery involved in the election process. Two companies make EVMs. They are ECIL and BEL. These two in turn import chips from two companies - Renesas, which is Japanese, and Microchips Technologies which is based in US. They say the code is put in the chips by BEL. They put the software in the chip, seal it and send it. They claim that neither can it be seen, nor read. We asked that when the chip comes here, do you check what software has been put by the companies. To this, in an RTI reply to different people, ECI has said that this software cannot be checked as it is masked. All that is needed is to introduce a small bug in these machines...
  

  

  Q: Why are you raising doubts over EVMs now?
  

  

  A: In the past four months, many developments have put a question mark over the reliability of EVMs. In Pune, an independent candidate got zero votes and he wondered where did his own vote and those of his family go. An investigation is needed. In Bhind it happened before so many journalists. There, whichever button was being pressed, the machine was voting for BJP. That is not malfunctioning, that is programming the machine in a manner that it will vote only for BJP. Something did happen to that machine. Was the motherboard changed? Was the chip changed? What happened? Two days later, ECI said the machine was fine. How? Next, questions were raised on 18 EVMs in Dhaulpur where on pressing the button, the vote was going to BJP. This means that the software of many machines has already been changed.
  

  

  Q: Do you still stand by your accusation that EC is acting like Dhritarashtra who wants Duryodhana or BJP to win?
  

  

  A: The reason for saying that is the fact that it is EC's responsibility to instill confidence in the minds of the people of this country about the election process being fair. So, whenever a question is raised on EVMs, EC should get an investigation done and put the findings in public domain. What they are doing instead is saying that they have found the machines to be fine.
  

  

  Q: You are questioning the impartiality of ECI. In this backdrop, what do you think is going to be the outcome in the office-of-profit case? Are you apprehensive that the EC will rule against AAP?
  

  

  A: There is a big question mark over EC. One of the election commissioners, A K Joti, was chief secretary of Gujarat under Modiji. After retirement, he was made chairman of Kandla Port Trust. So, he has worked with the Prime Minister for many years. The second election commissioner has come from Madhya Pradesh and has been very close to Shivraj Singh Chauhan. So, independence of both these election commissioners is under question. The only independent person is Syed Nasim Ahmad Zaidi, who is retiring in two months.
  

  

  Q: Now that you are sending all files for approval to the LG, has decision-making become easy or are there projects still on hold?
  

  

  A: All files are being sent to LG and everything is on hold. There are a lot of things that are not moving. For instance, there was a project for making 10 elevated corridors. That file is pending with the LG's office for one year. Similarly, we had said that we would redesign 10 roads on a pilot basis to end bottlenecks. The file for the architect's appointment is pending with the LG's office. Everything is going there and getting stuck. I now meet the LG regularly, every Wednesday, and seek approval for these files. He says he is studying it, looking at it
  

  

  Q: Your interaction with LG Anil Baijal has been very different from your dealings with Najeeb Jung. You have not publicly taken him on.
  

  

  A: We have no personal enmity with anyone. With this LG, the first three months were very well and we were able to explain our point of view over two-three meetings. But, just before these elections, the way the LG's office started attacking us was not healthy. The files relating to Rs 97 crore spent on advertisements and Ram Jethmalani's fee were leaked to the media. The issue of a Rs 15,000 thali was also leaked though nothing had been paid. So, it appears that the LG's office is an active party in this election. We are not countering all this aggressively because we don't want to make any enemies. To be able to work for people, we are prepared to bend as much as we need to. If we fight, it will be only for the rights and welfare of people.
  

  

  Q: You have promised to do away with house tax on residential properties if your party wins. Aren't you resorting to the politics of subsidies?
  

  

  A: The money belongs to people and all I am doing is returning your money to you. Should you be happy or angry? I repeat that there is no dearth of money in government, it is all about intention. I can streamline the house tax system but if my assessment shows that it is not required, then why not do away with it for residential properties? We reduced VAT from 12% to 5%. South Delhi Municipal Corporation's total budget is Rs 3300 crore; the house tax component is only Rs 300 crore. This is not very significant but people face a lot of harassment in paying the tax. There is so much corruption in MCD. A CAG report shows that Rs 1960 crore worth of pension was given to dead people over 10 years. The corporations also have 40,000 ghost employees on their payrolls. There are illegal hoardings, illegal parking. If all this is taken care of, so much money will be saved. We are saying that we will clean Delhi and make the city shine in one year. Cleaning Delhi is not rocket science. You need to float an international global tender. There are so many companies that work on sanitation in European countries. They can be hired to get your city cleaned. The corporations waste so much money on lifting and disposing of garbage.
  

  

  Q: You are talking of corruption in MCD but your campaign has not adequately focused on all that BJP has not done?
  

  

  A: When the MCD campaign started, these people started leaking files to the media on a daily basis through the LG's office and shifted the entire focus on us. Because of this, MCD could not be discussed much. Now our focus is only on one thing -- that if you want to clean Delhi, if you want to remove garbage and mosquitoes from Delhi, only AAP can do it. We are saying that in Delhi government, we practically have four major departments -- water, power, education and health. In all these sectors, we have delivered and now we are saying we will make a difference in sanitation.
  

  
    

    Q: The recent CVC report must have given you a lot of satisfaction. Considering the fact that ACB was not in your control, how was this achieved?
  
  

  

  A: Corruption has gone down as a result of technology and computerization. In departments like transport, human interaction has been reduced in a big way by doing away with manual processes. At the SDM office earlier, people would take a token and wait as the processes were manual, but now everything is online. One, technology is very important for reducing human interaction for dealing with corruption. Second is deterrence which is where Anti-Corruption Branch has a big role, but that was taken away from our government. Technology also brings transparency. The maximum effect of all this is visible in the departments of transport, revenue and health. For instance, EWS admissions and all processes in mohalla clinics and polyclinics have been made online. Theft of medicines is almost impossible now.
  

  

  Q: You are no longer attacking Narendra Modi.
  

  

  A: We have always done issue-based politics. We supported Swachh Bharat Mission and the yoga initiative but opposed demonetization because we think that was wrong.
  

  

  Q: Congress appears to be stronger than in 2015. Does that worry you?
  

  

  A: We are not worried. Our surveys show Congress is a distant third.
  

  

  Q: What about the AAP debacle in Rajouri Garden. Booth-wise results there show a shift in voters from AAP?
  

  

  A: There was a lot of anger among people over our decision to move out Jarnail Singh to fight the polls in Punjab. We sensed the anger a fortnight before the poll. Our door-to-door survey teams gave us the feedback.
  

  

  Q: Jarnail Singh has said that deep and honest introspection is required. He was referring to choice of candidates?
  

  

  A: Whenever a candidate is given a ticket, four people are denied. We are very clear that we will not compromise on four Cs -- communalism, corruption, crime and character. If anyone has any complaint on these grounds, they can come and object but things like this one was better and that one could have won are points of analysis. The party's PAC does that assessment.

  Q: Will these polls be a referendum on your government?
  

  

  A: We say compare the two years of Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi and 10 years of BJP in the municipal corporations. We want to ask if BJP has done one good thing in 10 years that people remember. Woh badmaash hain, woh nikkame hain, woh bhrashtachari hain, so don't vote for them. See our performance in Delhi for over two years and vote for us. I feel that if the polls are fair and EVMs are not tampered with, then AAP will get more than 200 seats. I would appeal to people to come and vote in large numbers so that the eight to nine per cent shift they may try to do through EVMs will get compensated by way of high voting.
  

  

  Q: Is there some restlessness among senior functionaries of your party? Do you feel a sense of crisis?
  

  

  A: There is nothing like that. I feel overall the crisis before the country is more serious. This game over EVMs that they have started. If this is way they will win elections, there will be no meaning left in the electoral process and democracy. The other big concern is the way violence is happening in society...not just physical violence....the atmosphere of fear that is taking shape is dangerous. If you write or speak anything contrary to the views of the government, then first you will be attacked with abusive language on social media, on phone or through sms. Then fake cases will be slapped, income tax will be unleashed on you...this atmosphere of fear is very dangerous."

Unlike the February strike, which had hit commuters hard for 13 days, most of Ola and Uber drivers chose not to participate in Tuesday's strike called by the Sarvodaya Drivers' Association of Delhi. The union claims to represent 1.25 lakh app-based taxis.
  

  

  During the evening and morning peak hours, cabs were easily available on both Ola and Uber apps. However, the companies resorted to surge pricing on some routes. The drivers' union has given a 10-day ultimatum to the Delhi government to act on their demands, failing which they will go on an indefinite strike. ""This time, it will have a major impact on the operation of app-based taxis,"" said Ravi Rathore, vice-president of the union.
  

  

  Although the strike had no impact, Rathore claimed around 50% of the cabs went off roads in NCR. ""Around 50% of app-based cabs did not ply in Delhi NCR. We held a protest outside the CM's office,"" he added. The drivers have been demanding an increase in fares from the existing Rs 6 per km to Rs 20 per km. They are also demanding abolition of 25% commission that the drivers are charged by cab aggregators. The drivers also want the government to allow them to ply their taxis on the fares prescribed by the Delhi transport department.
  

  

  Earlier in the day, around 50 drivers took out a march from Majnu-ka-Tila to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence with their vehicles in north Delhi's Civil Lines where they burnt his effigy.

  Akhilesh will not be comfortable in naming either as given to the bitterness with his uncle Shivpal Yadav after the widely reported family feud. By expressing his views on his Twitter account, Shivpal Yadav has hinted at patch up with Akhilesh and a unified struggle to return to power in the state. But Akhilesh Yadav, it is learnt, doesn't want to allow Shivpal to play any key role in the party.
  

  

  On the other hand, Azam Khan will also be a difficult choice for Akhilesh, given the former's unpredictable temperament. Besides, not being a member of the Assembly, Akhilesh would not be there to make any impact in the house. In the legislative council too, Akhilesh faces dilemma as at present the Leader of the Samajwadi Party in the council is Ahmed Hasan.

  ""Within six months we will regularise all the contractual employees and make the three corporations self-reliant by increasing collection from property tax, toll tax, parking and outdoor advertising departments.

He also blamed the leadership, especially at the state level, for the ""mess"" in the party.
  

  

  Lovely was reacting to some Congress functionaries calling him an ""opportunist"" — Dikshit had on Tuesday said that the former DPCC chief had betrayed the party.
  

  

  Explaining his decision to join BJP, Lovely said he had two options: either become a burden like Dikshit, or be called a ""traitor"" by joining a party that is fighting for the cause of soldiers. ""I would rather be called a traitor by joining BJP than be a burden on Congress like Sheila Dikshit,"" he said. ""I respect Sheilaji, but I'm calling her a burden as she has no say in the party. She was not consulted during ticket distribution. She is neither a part of the manifesto and campaign committees nor is she being called to campaign. Why is she in Congress then?"" he said.
  

  

  He said Congress' reluctance to pitch a Sikh chief ministerial face even in a state like Punjab had disappointed the community.
  

  

  ""For the Sikh community in the city and the country, there can't be a better platform than BJP. I appeal to the community, especially in Delhi, to vote for BJP,"" said Lovely.
  

  

  Following in Lovely's footsteps, several of his supporters joined BJP on Wednesday. These included senior functionaries such as Sukhbir Sharma, Vinod Jain (a Congress rebel who is contesting as an independent from Shastri Park), S K Puri, Parminder Singh, Pankaj Kochar, Rahul Mathur and Sandeep Singh.
  

  

  Hinting at growing discontent in Congress, Lovely said: ""I had never thought in my dreams that I will join BJP. But all Congress leaders are thinking about (leaving the party). We (Amit Malik and I) have shown courage ... don't know when the rest will do the same.""

  Addressing a press conference at Delhi BJP headquarters, he slammed Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken for his love for ""comfort"" and for not focusing on unauthorised colonies and slums. ""The Delhi BJP chief sleeps in slums whereas he (Maken) campaigns in Lodhi Garden, so that he can go home quickly. The Congress I had joined worked for poor people. The party needs to review its policy,"" said Lovely.
  

  

  Asked to comment on Maken breaking down during a TV interview while talking about Lovely's decision to quit the party, he said, ""When I was crying, he didn't come to hear me out. A person cries when he has done something wrong. I'm laughing, as I'm happy.""
  

  

  He said it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief's policies and leadership quality that prompted him to join BJP. He said a lot of Congress members appreciated the policies and decisions taken by Modi government. ""We used to appreciate the good decisions taken by Modi government, though behind closed doors,"" he said.

Residents of south Delhi's East of Kailash, though, got a better opportunity to know their candidates and their views on a host of issues.
  

  

  On Sunday evening, in a 'meet your candidate' programme, organised by United Residents Joint Action of Delhi (URJA), three candidates — Indu Sharma (Congress), Devender Tanwar (AAP) and Rajpal (BJP) participated in a debate.
  Benefits from home refinancing.TomorrowMakersInvest here today to become rich tomorrowFundsIndiaRecommended By Colombia

  

  A set of questions was given to the candidates in five rounds, revolving around five issues — local problems; views on constitution of residents ward committee; their perspective and promises in the manifesto; the pollution crisis; and corruption in the civic apparatus. Each candidate was given two minutes. There was strict enforcement of rules and the microphone had to be muted many times, eliciting a protest from supporters.
  

  

  While the AAP candidate focused on sanitation and non-functioning streetlights, Sharma from Congress spoke about lack of parking space as the main issue. BJP candidate Rajpal said the real problem was lack of intent, leading to a situation in which spots like Okhla mandi have become a nightmare. While all three candidates supported creation of a resident ward committee through which citizens can monitor projects happening in the city, the AAP candidate reminded people that the Mohalla Sabha Bill, which would have created 40 mohalla sabhas in Kalkaji, was a better solution and was shot down by the LG.
  

  

  A common feature in western democracies, such town hall debates and meetings have failed here because of rowdy supporters and lack of cooperation from candidates. However, the gathering of 200-250 residents in Ramesh Gupta Park proved that such events can be carried out successfully.
  

  

  Retired wing commander and URJA convener, J S Chaddha, said, ""It is very important for voters to be informed about their candidates. We had apprehensions that candidates might back out or things might go haywire but in the end, we were able to organise it successfully with the help of people. URJA has a presence in many wards and we will try to organise more such debates"". Chaddha was also the moderator for the debate."

  The revised pension will be taken up by the Union cabinet along with three-four issues related to the pay of central government employees, even as a committee headed by Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa finalises its recommendations for allowances for government employees, including an increase in the house rent allowance (HRA). The panel is expected to submit its recommendations next week but there are indications that the change in allowances may not take place immediately.
  

  

  ""The revised pension scheme has been finalised and the government has postponed a decision due to the code of conduct for Delhi municipal elections. The cabinet may clear it next week,"" said a source, who did not wish to be identified.
  

  

  The pay panel had recommended an increment-linked pension formula along with the option for multiplying the pension based on the six pay commission's recommendations by 2.57. To quickly implement the suggestions, the government opted for the second option as the increment-linked pension model was seen to be difficult to implement. This has created a situation where those who retired by December 31, 2015 are receiving a lower pension compared to someone who retired a month later. For instance, someone who retired as a secretary before January 2016 is getting a pension of Rs 1.02 lakh compared to Rs 1.12 lakh for someone who retired at the end of the month.
  

  

  Now, the government is looking at two options -- one is to move to a new ""modified parity-plus"" formula, which links the pension to the salary drawn by someone who is at the same rank. The other is a formula based on the multiple of the sixth pay commission-based pension. A sources said the factor of 2.57 is also being changed to make the pension more attractive. ""Basically, there will be two options for a pensioner and the formula that ensures a higher payout to the seniors will be given,"" explained a source."

They are using middlemen who extort money from the people in the name of house tax,"" alleged Dilip Kumar Pandey, AAP Delhi convener.

  BJP, however, rejected the allegations. ""BJP never announced that it will waive house tax for all Delhi households,"" said Rajesh Bhatia, general secretary Delhi BJP. ""In 2007 BJP promised to waive the tax in urban villages and rural areas but not across the capital.""
  

  

  AAP also promised that when it comes to power, it will constitute town vending committees, and regularise street vendors soon.
  

  

  ""BJP has looted Rs 1.31 crores from vendors. Each street vendor gave Rs 100 as fees for regularisation and license while some of them were charged Rs 500 and Rs 1000 by middlemen who enjoyed the political patronage of BJP and Congress,"" alleged Pandey.

  For instance, in Timarpur, 21-year-old Megha, who prefers to go by her first name, shrugs off the dismissals of her more seasoned opponents, one of whom mocked, ""Megha is younger than my son, she needs time to mature."" She counters this with the aggression and optimism of youth.
  

  

  The final year undergraduate student of Delhi University and Swaraj India candidate smiled, ""Most of my rivals are older than my father, yes, but I have the support of slum dwellers whose children I have been teaching for over a year.""
  

  

  Whether new ideas and age are enough to beat experience will be clear only on April 26, the day the ballots are counted.
  

  

  But the outcome of their campaigns is not crucially important to this clutch of newly minted politicians in just the second decade of their lives.
  

  

  To them, the public embrace of their aims is more important than deference to the age and experience of their opponents. As BJP candidate from Raghubir Nagar, 22-year old Poorva Sankla, put it: ""Age is not a factor, the willingness to work for the people is.""
  

  

  Ideals fuel the enthusiasm of youthful politicians. If Megha's intention, being a jhuggi dweller herself, is to elevate jhuggi-jhopris to the top of the corporations' priority list, Leena Asiwal, 21, AAP candidate from Vikaspuri, hopes to root out corruption, which she described as ""the biggest obstacle in improving the infrastructure and sanitation in the ward"".
  

  

  Independent candidate from Rani Bagh, Jyoti, is similarly motivated. Once a child labourer who was aided by an NGO in overcoming the objections of her family to get herself educated, Jyoti explained, ""I thought I could change more lives if I joined politics. That is why I am fighting the civic polls.""

  Kajal Sharma became active in social service after being inspired by Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement. She is taking on the much older and more experienced Nilam Arora, the Congress candidate, Vandana Jaitely of BJP and Simmi Gupta of AAP as a Swaraj India nominee in Rani Bagh.
  

  

  ""I often went to the local councillor for help in cleaning up areas in the ward, but he did not help. So I decided to defeat him in an election,"" confided the commerce graduate from Delhi University.
  

  

  It was a feeling of helplessness that also drove 21-year-old Kajal Sherawat to politics. ""The councillors never bother about people's problems too much after winning elections. The ward needs young blood like me,"" declared Sherawat, most of whose rivals are aged above 50.
  

  

  Many hope it is not mere words that these youngsters are indulging in. But they have the example of Sankla, an engineer who left her Rs 9 lakh per annum job because she felt she could do a better job in improving educational facilities and sanitation in her ward. Voters expect that like her, the others too will put their money where their mouth is."
"How municipal schools are failing Delhi’s children","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/how-municipal-schools-are-failing-citys-children/articleshow/58307235.cms","NEW DELHI: The three municipal corporations of Delhi have the responsibility of educating nearly 8.2 lakh children in the primary section, from Class I to V. Given the ever increasing fees in private schools, the municipal schools have a crucial significance. But a report, based on data collected by Praja Foundation through RTI applications, found the enrollment has dropped 27% in the past five years, the dropout rate is at a high 12%, and the pupil-teacher ratio is much higher than the prescribed 1 teacher per 40 students. Supportive programmes like mid-day meals are deficient, school libraries are poor, sports facilities are lacking and a majority of students need to supplement school lessons with private tuition.
  Footlodge Mens Blue  Black Lace-up Smart Casuals ShoesShopcluesDo you have enough for the future? Check now!TomorrowMakersRecommended By Colombia

  

  The report released in December 2016 said the East Delhi Municipal Corporation appeared to be the worst affected, with dropout rates touching 18%, he pupil teacher ratio at 42:1, utilisation of allocated funds under various heads very low, and nil expenditure on mid-day meals and libraries in 2015-16. EDMC had the lowest per student spend among all three corporations.
  

  

  The south corporation recorded the lowest dropout figures and a better pupil-teacher ratio, but its utilization of Plan allocations was just 67%, even if its spending under non-Plan heads was much higher.
  

  

  Clearly, a combination of factors — finances, utilization planning (or academic expertise) and political leadership —play a role in this dismal trend. One worrying fallout of this drop in municipal education quality is that families are opting out of the affordable municipal schools and entering the costlier private-education system. Many families are likely to pull out their children at some stage of schooling, and perhaps the axe will fall on the girl child.
  

  

  Electioneering for the municipal corporations has come to a close. Now the fate of schoolchildren is in the hands of an electorate that has been given wild promises on education by the three main political contenders."

So, well before the party announces its chief minister, government officials are hard at work to get the its poll manifesto ready for implementation.
  

  

  Different government departments have requested the BJP headquarters in Lucknow for additional copies of the manifesto, and chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar held two meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday to get officers to plan ahead. A bureaucrat on condition of anonymity, said, ""It is unclear whether the instructions have been conveyed by the party or whether it is purely a bureaucratic initiative to appear 'with it'. At any rate, it is an exercise to understand the priorities of the new party and to fall in line, accordingly.""
  

  

  Until Wednesday, the forest department, for instance, forwarded its presentation to the office of the chief secretary, on BJP poll promises relating to social forestry and protecting agricultural produce against stray animals and blue bulls. There is also a plan to carry out plantation exercises on national holidays. ""We have sent our input on how we will achieve plantation target,"" said Rupak De, PCCF, UP.
  

  

  Considering most of the BJP's poll promises will be implemented through the social welfare department, officials here are also readying for action. On Tuesday, the secretary's office called the BJP headquarters requesting for a copy of Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra, the official name of the manifesto. A senior BJP leader said officials from other department have also raised similar requests. In fact, BJP leaders have now supplied several copies of the manifesto at the party office for anyone who might needs a copy. ""I ensured that around 30 copies are kept at BJP office so that it could be given to the officials of the department as when they need it,"" the leader said.

"Our corporators failed to tell people about our work: Tiwari","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/delhi-mcd/news/our-corporators-failed-to-tell-people-about-our-work-tiwari/articleshow/58289078.cms","You started campaigning very early with your night stays at slums. What insight into the mind of the Delhi electorate did you got through this long spell of campaigning?
  

  

  People aren't clear about the roles and duties of various civic and government agencies in the city. More than sanitation, water and waterlogging are the main issues in this municipal election. In east Delhi, water supply is a serious problem. People get aggressive as they are not getting water supply in their homes though they are ready to pay. I can't explain to people that it doesn't come under the corporations.
  

  

  Similarly, traffic is another big problem, especially in east Delhi. It is PWD's responsibility to construct flyovers and widen roads for smooth traffic movement. Waterlogging is another problem, but people don't know that only cleaning of only small drains is with the corporations. PWD is responsible for the big drains.
  

  

  Why is there a compulsion to bring PM Narendra Modi so much into the campaign?
  

  

  Narendra Modi is the name of a policy. When we take Modi's name, people know that we are talking about development, public welfare, action against corrupt people etc. Congress has a policy called Rahul Gandhi which stands for corruption, inefficiency etc.
  

  

  BJP's manifesto for the upcoming elections is largely a repeat of party's poll promises made during 2007 and 2012 municipal polls.
  

  

  The corporations couldn't deliver due to shortage of funds. Out of the Delhi government's Rs 48,000-crore budget, the three civic agencies are supposed to get Rs 9000 crore. But the government is not giving funds.
  

  

  While you criticized AAP for promising property tax waiver, BJP has also assured that no new taxes will be levied for the next five years. How do you plan to boost internal revenue?
  

  

  Who itna jhoot bol chuke hai ki ab unhe log yeh kehne lage hai ki Modiji ke pass 56-inch ka seena hai aur Arvind Kejriwal ke pass 56-inch ki jeebh hai. (He has lied so much that people have started saying that Modiji's chest size is 56 inch and Arvind Kejriwal's tongue is 56 inch long).
  

  

  For the next five years, we will not introduce any new taxes. We will try to provide services from the funds we will get from the state government. We will also try to fix the problem areas which have become a source of corruption. We can increase our internal revenue without increasing or imposing new taxes.
  

  

  You said that efforts will be made to ensure corporations get funds directly from the Centre. How will it be done?
  

  

  There will be a (financial) problem for a year...The budget for this financial year has been cleared (by the Centre). But this year, our focus will be on ensuring that the Delhi government releases corporations' share in funds on time....The present government is discriminating against the corporations because of its political agenda. We will protest against this.
  

  

  BJP couldn't utilize the funds given by the Centre under Swachh Bharat mission, PM's pet project. In 10 years, BJP couldn't streamline the solid waste management in the city.
  

  

  If the corporations had done their duty in implementing that mission, then we wouldn't have had to change 153 councillors.
  

  

  Do you expect some of the sitting corporators who have been victims of a mass culling to silently work against the party?

  The party is keeping a close watch on everybody and will not any tolerate anti-party activities. People will be punished. We are not saying that all are corrupt but they were inefficient.
  

  

  They failed to tell people about the work the corporations have done. They allowed the opposition parties to create a perception that the corporations didn't do much work, which is completely wrong. For instance, parks are the most happening places in Delhi.

  ""Congress has introduced its candidates as wives and daughters of a particular person. Many leaders have managed to get the party nomination by getting their wives and female relatives to contest the seat,"" Yadav alleged. Swaraj India, Yadav said, has done its best to be gender inclusive by fielding 111 women among the 211 fighting the polls under its banner — 19 in the general wards and 92 in the seats reserved for women.
  

  

  One of the party's star woman candidates is international para-athlete Suvarna Raj in Badarpur. ""My schooling was difficult because of my disability and I had to continue my education at home after a point because schools are not disabled-friendly,"" said the wheelchair-bound athlete. It isn't without feeling that Raj wants to work for greater inclusivity for disabled students in corporation schools.
  

  

  Swaraj India's nominees also pitched for the place of women in the society and politics, often making their campaign more about helping women break out of society-imposed roles at home.

Following delimitation in 2007, BSP old-timer Tribhuwan Dutt contested for Alapur and won. Dutt, however, lost the seat in 2012 but Mayawati gave him a ticket again. This time, Dutt got third place.

Sisodia further claimed that audits are conducted on specific issues and the scale of irregularities suggests that the scam is not less than Rs 1000 crore.
  

  

  This is latest of a series of corruption allegations AAP has levelled against BJP ever since the campaigning.""Financial irregularities"" involving road construction under bridge at GT road (4.6 crore), bogus issue of text books ( Rs 1.3 lakhs) in North Corporation, non-adjustment of temporary advances drawn by officers of different departments during 1988 to 2012 (Rs 54.5 crore) in EDMC and Rs 22.6 crores in SDMC were the highlights of the allegations.
  

  

  ""The chief auditor did not get any reply from the corporations when it brought the irregularities in the corporations' notice,"" Sisodia added.
  

  

  AAP will bring outcome budget in the corporations, Sisodia said, when AAP comes to power in the corporations and will fix the responsibility of each officer."

  AAP Delhi convener Dilip Kumar Pandey listed the ""failures"" of BJP-led corporations and said that the party has done nothing to make the conditions in Delhi better. ""BJP has lost all the moral grounds to contest the civic elections,"" Pandey said.
  

  

  In over 1,200 words letter based on the 19-page booklet released by BJP, AAP attacked the party on corruption and flagged the observations of Central Information Commission on the issues of sanitation workers and corporations' staff.

  ""BJP-led corporations are a blot on the face of good governance and pro-people politics. All the promises made in the manifesto should have been fulfilled long ago, but your lies know no limits,"" Pandey said.
  

  

  The AAP Delhi convener pointed out that CAG had found 501 irregularities and evidence of misuse of corporation funds. He asked, ""How can BJP even think of contesting the election?""
  

  

  Pandey also attached the booklet with the letter and suggested Shah to take time out to reflect and undertake course correction.
  

  

  BJP has fielded fresh faces in all wards to lessen the impact of anti-incumbency. It has mounted aggressive campaign to take on Congress and AAP, its main rivals. In its manifesto, BJP has promised to provide meals for Rs 10 and proposed no new municipal taxes in reaction to AAP's promise to waive all taxes on residential properties as well as the arrears of defaulters."

Highly placed sources in Delhi say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants a person in the seat who can deliver up to his expectations and implement his development agenda.
  

  

  ""Even if the new CM has to be remote-controlled from the PM Office, he would not mind, but his priority is implementing his vision of development in letter and spirit,"" said a Union minister who visited the state frequently during the elections.

  We expect a totally new work culture in the state with a new-look bureaucracy, he said. Three UP cadre officers in Delhi—cabinet secretary PK Sinha, principal secretary to CM Nripendra Mishra and deputy secretary in PMO Mayur Maheshwari—are likely to give vital inputs for the selection of officers to run the PM's development programmes.
  

  

  The new CM, therefore, is not only supposed to be a doer, but also a leader who could hold a firm grip on the 1,000-strong bureaucracy. The BJP brass feels that chief ministers in UP generally get surrounded by a handful of bureaucrats who don't allow him to work independently. ""This will not be repeated. The new candidate, even if inexperienced for the top post, would not be a captive in bureaucrats' hands,"" said another minister.
  

  

  BJP leaders feel that in the past 15 years of SP-BSP rule, there has been a set pattern of functioning and an identified group of bureaucrats who worked only on political agenda of the ruling establishment while largely ignoring the general welfare of the state. All this is going end, they said.
  

  

  The PM has been saying in his rallies that India can't progress without development of UP. Now that his party is firmly in the saddle after 15 years, his priority would be to implement his development agenda. The new CM and group of top bureaucrats would be selected with this goal in mind."

  On Wednesday night, Union minister for urban development Venkaiah Naidu campaigned for the BJP candidates in south Delhi's RK Puram Sector 12 and Chhatarpur.
  

  

  RK Puram, home to a large number of bureaucrats, has a noticeable south Indian population as well. From songs played by orchestras to movie stars like Ravi Kishan as well as Union ministers, the appeal to voters are now being made in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""All over the world, people are talking about India due to the leadership and vision of PM Modi. We have consistently won state and local body elections all over the country because of him,"" said Naidu.

  Terming the Rajouri Garden bypoll verdict as a trailer, Naidu predicted a landslide victory for BJP in the civic polls. ""The fact that AAP couldn't even save its deposit despite having 67 MLAs shows the level of resentment among people.""
  

  

  The performance of BJP during its 10 years of MCD rule remained characteristically missing from Naidu's speech. Potshots were taken at both the major opposition parties. Naidu blamed chief minister Kejriwal for becoming ""over ambitious"" and ""running away"" from responsibilities in the capital. ""You gave an overwhelming mandate to Kejriwal, but what happened? He went to Varanasi, Gujarat, Goa and Punjab and lost everywhere. Now he is asking you to vote for him again,"" he said.
  

  

  Referring to the allegations made in the Shunglu Committee report, the Union minister said that there was no difference between AAP and Congress as far as corruption was concerned. ""The central government does not have a single allegation of corruption against it, but these parties (Congress and AAP) have hundreds of such dark spots,"" he added.
  

  

  Addressing the south Indian community, Naidu said that they might have a different language, but were all ""a part of one nation with one destiny"" and followed it with a message in Tamil which meant to strengthen ""Modi's hand"". The audience also had a considerable number of Poorvanchali voters from surrounding slums and JJ clusters."

""At least 2.44 lakh voters have been added to the list from January to April this year,"" he said.

The police have arrested 222 people and 41 vehicles carrying liquor have been seized. ""We have instructed authorities like DSIIDC to reduce supply of liquor till the end of the elections,"" said Srivastava. Seventy FIRs have also been lodged against hoardings, banners, posters and writing on walls.

  ""When people question them (BJP) on issues like sanitation, dengue and chikungunya, they say 'Vote for Modi',"" he said during a press meet at his residence. Mounting his attack on both BJP and Congress, Kejriwal alleged that workers from these parties were stealing oil from electricity transformers, leading to disruption in power supply. He claimed BJP and Congress workers had even damaged pipelines to disrupt water supply to various colonies.
  

  

  ""BJP and Congress workers have stolen transformer oil from 70 places. They have stolen valves from water pipelines. In Sangam Vihar, chunks of cement were put into the sewer lines to choke them."" Kejriwal claimed that the problems would grow till Sunday. ""They will do it till Sunday when polling is scheduled. It is part of their dirty politics,"" he said.
  

  

  Launching a counter-attack, DPCC spokesperson Chattar Singh alleged that Kejriwal and his workers are ""experts in climbing electricity poles and cutting wires"". ""The disruptions are the handiwork of their workers to gain political mileage ahead of elections,"" Singh said.
  

  

  Delhi BJP also rubbished Kejriwal's allegations. ""We believe that negative campaign by Kejriwal is reflective of his fear of defeat in the civic polls.

  However, the other Election Commissioner A K Joti, whose impartiality was questioned by Kejriwal in the same interview, has refused to follow in Rawat's footsteps, telling TOI that he would continue to ""discharge his duties in a free, fair and impartial manner and as per law"".
  

  

  With the disqualification plea against 21 AAP MLAs being the most prominent case awaiting the EC verdict on its maintainability in the wake of the HC cancelling their appointment as parliamentary secretaries, the EC is consulting legal experts on whether Rawat, who was part of the hearing before the order was reserved, can recuse himself from the final verdict.
  

  

  When contacted, Rawat confirmed he had written to the CEC saying that in view of CM's interview to TOI questioning his independence as election commissioner, he would like to recuse himself from all AAP-related cases being heard by EC. This, he submitted in the letter, was to ensure that Kejriwal and AAP not only get justice ""but also perceive that EC has been fair beyond any shred of doubt"".
  

  

  ""Since Kejriwal had stated in the interview that he did not have faith in my impartiality, the only option available to me to instil his confidence in EC was to recuse myself from all AAP cases before EC,"" said Rawat.
  

  

  Even as the EC is still examining its impact on the office of profit case against 21 AAP MLAs, Rawat insisted that he had consciously recused himself to ensure that he is spared ""a much sharper attack from Kejriwal and AAP on his impartiality in the event of an adverse decision"".

  EC officials said Rawat's recusing himself was ""an individual decision by an independent election commissioner"". Sources indicated the possibility of the order in AAP case being a two-member bench decision comprising the CEC and EC A K Joti.
  

  

  Meanwhile, Rawat's colleague Joti on Thursday told TOI that while he had no comments to offer on the decision, as far as he was concerned, he was part of all collective decisions by ECs that were not only free, fair and impartial but taken strictly as per the relevant laws and rules.
  

  

  ""The decisions taken by EC are not by one individual. They are decisions of EC as a whole and are mostly unanimous,"" he said.
  

  

  Joti added that EC had been regularly meeting and hearing complaints of office-bearers of all parties including AAP, and examining their suggestions with due diligence before taking appropriate action as per the law. ""Not once have we said no to officer bearers of parties who want to meet. We have also met and heard Kejriwal and other office-bearers of AAP.

  For some residents, BJP's win is the dawn of a new era for development and an end to dynastic politics. Some others went a step ahead and said that it is the 'reversal of V P Singh's politics of Mandalisation.' ""I have been waiting for this day for 25 years. The victory of BJP brings a 360 degree reversal of Mandalisation initiated by V P Singh. Sad it took 25 years to clear the mess that was created by Singh. The SP and BSP were all unfortunate fallout of Mandalisation. The political scenario was dominated by casteism instead of growth and development issues,"" said Anil Batta, CEO of Marketels, a Noida-based enterprise.
  

  

  Ashok Hak, senior vice president Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA) maintained that the massive win for BJP augurs well for the country, UP and Noida city.
  

  

  ""BJP's victory is a sign of approval for Modi's leadership, development initiatives, and it also shows that people want to junk disastrous appeasement politics,"" said Hak.

""Ant mein yeh chunav Hindu-Muslim ho gaya (this election became Hindu-Muslim in the end). I don't think our efforts to alienate Jat voters from BJP went waste. The community is still angry with BJP, but it failed to tactically shift away from the saffron party,"" Malik said.
  

  

  ""In the later part of their poll campaign, the saffron party leaders aggressively campaigned on communal lines. This was also coupled with the murder of a Jat boy in restive Peda village of Bijnor on the eve of polling in the region. These incidents eventually polarised the political atmosphere here,"" he added.
  

  

  The sangharsh samiti had launched an aggressive anti-BJP campaign in 125 seats of west UP where Jats have sizable votes. Samiti's teams from Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi were sent to west UP constituencies in Jat-dominated Meerut, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Amroha and Mathura, etc, to apprise Jat voters of the ""atrocities inflicted on Jat quota stir leaders by the BJP government in Haryana"".

  With massive mandate in favour of BJP in Uttar Pradesh in general and west UP in particular that houses some of the biggest Jat khaps, the Jat reservation agitation is likely to take a hit. Barring Chhaprauli in Baghpat district, all Jat-dominated regions have seen surge of BJP candidates.
  

  

  ""The UP mandate will certainly give the ruling party a sense of confidence and it might harden its stance when it comes to allotment of Jat quota. We could have humbled it only through electoral process and if BJP had fared badly in west UP, things would have become easier for us. Nonetheless, we will continue our agitation for our rights,"" Malik said.

  However, Malik admitted the fact that unity among Jats is also an issue that needs to be looked into. ""We had only made an appeal to the community not to vote for BJP. We couldn't guaranteed that everyone would heed our call. We need to work more aggressively in ensuring a strong unity within the community. We will have to work towards it,"" he said.

  Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students union had announced support to Mayawati's Bahujan Samajwadi party and appealed to all Muslims to defeat the alliance and the BJP but the results have shown a different outcome.
  

  

  BJP's Sanjeev Raja defeated Samajwadi party's sitting MLA, Zafar Alam with a margin of 15,440 votes in Aligarh constituency. Zafar Alam bagged 98312 votes.

  Even the greenhorn Suchi Chaudhary, wife of Peda riot accused Aishwarya Chaudhary, is a winner from Bijnor seat. Speaking to TOI, an exuberant Som said, ""I have always been saying that all these charges against me were state sponsored. Now see. Janata ne apna jawab de diya hai.

  Like Som who is a Muzaffarnagar riots accused, Suresh Rana, the Thanabhawan constituency winner, too, was booked for hate speech ahead of elections. During an election rally, Rana was quoted as saying, ""Curfew will be imposed in Kairana, Deoband and Moradabad if I win election."" Later he retracted from his statement.

  Almost half a dozen people were booked for the rioting, including Aishwarya Chaudhary who has close links with RSS. Chaudhary is still behind bars. Giving the poll ticket to Chaudhary was a tactical decision by the BJP that eventually helped the party secure a seat from the powerful SP candidate Ruchi Veera.
  

  

  Speaking to TOI, Suchi Chaudhary who polled more than a lakh votes and won by a handsome margin of 27,181 votes, said, ""This mandate is not only an electoral mandate but also one against injustice.

Owaisi's poll rally here had seen an impressive crowd in attendance, adding weight to AIMIM's hopes of registering a victory in Sambhal and opening its account in UP.

  Barq, who banked on his grandfather's immense goodwill over the large population of Turk Muslims in Rohilkhand, got 60,426 votes and stood second while BJP candidate Dr Arvind Gupta ended up third.
  

  

  Another promising AIMIM candidate, Mohd Tabish Khan, came fifth from Mehdawal seat in Sant Kabir Nagar.

  Since AIMIM won two seats in Maharashtra assembly elections in 2014, Owaisi has been trying hard to launch his party nationally. In the Bihar elections, AIMIM contested on six seats and lost all. It made inroads into the Brihamumbai Municipal Corporation earlier this year. Contesting for the first time, it won from two wards. The party won a total of eight seats, taking into account the wins from other civic corporations in Maharashtra.
  

  

  During the poll campaign in UP, Owaisi addressed many rallies and made scathing attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government in UP. Owaisi alleged that Modi and Akhilesh Yadav were hand-in-glove against Muslims."
"From don to dusk, Ansaris late on the draw in family turf","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/-from-don-to-dusk-ansaris-late-on-the-draw-in-family-turf/articleshow/57604058.cms","BAREILLY: Bahujan Samaj Party's much-discussed induction of don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari for that extra push in her eastern bastion eventually proved to be her Achilles' heel as it only helped Hindu votes consolidate in favour of the BJP in the region. Though Ansari managed to win his Mau seat with a slender margin of 8,000 votes, his son and elder brother both lost the polls.
  

  

  According to the sources, BSP which looked to be in a straight contest with the BJP in the region lost a major chunk of its goodwill and votes due to Mukhtar's last-minute entry into the party. The BSP supremo had sprung a surprise when she brought in the mafia don into the party eyeing consolidation of Muslim votes in the region.

  Later, Mayawati also landed in Mau district to campaign for the jailed don who was the party's candidate from the Sadar seat there. Seeking votes for him, Mayawati said that his victory would erase his 'bahubali' image. ""I urge you to vote in large numbers, thereby ensuring a comprehensive victory for Mukhtar Ansari. Once he wins the assembly polls, his 'baahubali' image will gradually diminish,"" she had said.
  

  

  Mukhtar, who faces 40 criminal cases, including those of murder and kidnapping, recently joined BSP after the merger of his QED with the SP couldn't take place due to objections from chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. But Mayawati let him in to consolidate the BSP's Muslim-Dalit combination in some constituencies of eastern belt where the Ansari brothers were perceived to have substantial influence.
  

  

  The experiment, however, backfired. Ansari's son Abbas Ansari, a national level shooter who was contesting from Ghosi seat in Mau, lost to Fagu Chauhan of the BJP. Mukhtar's elder brother Sibgatullah Ansari, who was locked in contest with BJP's Alka Rai, slain BJP leader Krishnanand Rai's wife, in Mohammadabad seat, lost the polls to her by a huge margin of over 32,000 votes.
  

  

  In Mau, other than Mukhtar's seat, BJP won all the three others. In neighbouring Ghazipur, BJP won five out of seven seats while it won all the seats in Varanasi where its prospects seemed to be flagging initially.
  

  

  Union minister of state for railways Manoj Sinha is being credited for BJP's exceptional performance in eastern UP, especially in Ghazipur. Sinha has not only played an instrumental role in candidate selection in the region, he also meticulously pitted himself as the arch rival of the Ansari family, making it a battle for prestige in seats where the don's family were contesting. ""I left no stone unturned to ensure that Mukhtar Ansari stays in jail and is not out on parole,"" Sinha said."

The aspirants who won the historic mandate are BJP candidates Rani Pakshalika Singh from Bah constituency and Hemlata Diwakar, an SP rebel who won on a BJP ticket from Agra Rural seat.
  

  

  While Hemlata Diwakar won the election with a record margin of 65,296 votes, Pakshalika Singh won by a margin of 23,140 votes.
  

  

  The last time a woman became an MLA in Agra was in 1974 when Congress candidate Champawati won the assembly elections from Fatehpur Sikri. She was the first woman candidate to have ever won an assembly election from the district. She had received 25,514 votes as compared to 9,538 of Bharatiya Kranti Dal's Bhairon Singh.

  Hemlata Diwakar received 1,29,887 votes as against 64,591 votes received by BSP candidate Kali Charan Suman who had defeated the former in the 2012 assembly elections.
  

  

  Talking to TOI, Hemlata said, ""I have been active in the constituency as a social worker for a long time. Party found me as a suitable candidate in the city and I owe my victory to the hard work of the cadres.""
  

  

  ""We got an overwhelming support during campaigning which has translated into votes. Bigger mandate means bigger expectations. As a majority of people in my constituency are dependent on agriculture, issues of farmers will be my top priority. In the first 100 days, my focus will be on developing employment opportunities, especially for women. By bringing all gram pradhans together, I will work on the education of girl children and infrastructural development,"" she said.

  When 26-year-old Abdullah had announced his political debut from Suar Tanda constituency, a BJP bastion and stronghold of the Rampur royal family for two decades, many said that he could have opted for any other safe seat. ""In the past, no candidate from the SP was willing to contest from Suar Tanda as it has been with the royal family of Nawab Kazim Ali Khan and the BJP. However, I recorded a thumping victory from here,"" said a jubilant Abdullah. Abdullah caught the attention of the SP leadership after his first public appearance in 2014 to address a political rally in the run-up to the Lok Sabha poll.

  In Suar Tanda, BJP's Laxmi Saini stood at second position with 53,347 votes while four-time MLA and BSP candidate Nawab Kazim Ali Khan acquired third position with 42,233 votes. There are nearly 52% Muslims and around 48% Hindus of a total 2.98 lakh voters here.
  

  

  According to Abdullah, the decision to contest polls was due to ""high public demand"". ""After the election commission imposed a ban on my father during the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, I addressed Suar Tanda residents for the first time. After that there have been demands from people that I should also contest elections and bring development to this area. My father was reluctant at first but he agreed eventually,"" Abdullah said.

  Father Azam Khan, on the other hand, holds considerable clout in the state and has been an eight-time MLA from Rampur. Though he campaigned in Suar Tanda for five days only, Abdullah believes it worked to his advantage.
  

  

  Political analysts were also doubtful of Azam's win, predicting that it would be a tough fight between him and BSP candidate Tanveer Ahmad Khan due to the latter's increasing popularity among minority voters. Azam secured 1,02,100 votes while BJP's Shiv Bahadur Saxena and Tanveer got 55,258 and 54,248 votes respectively."

She began by discussing campaign plans with Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is in charge of UP.
  

  

  The go-alone strategy was, however, dumped for an alliance with Samajwadi Party, and in early November, Prashant Kishor, the strategist behind both the NDA Lok Sabha triumph of 2014 and Nitish Kumar's successful war plan in Bihar in 2015, was sent as the party emissary to Mulayam Singh Yadav twice and then to CM Akhilesh Yadav.

  While Akhilesh remained non-committal, Mulayam publicly dismissed a tie-up with the Congress. By then Kishor had also attempted backroom conversations with Ajit Singh's RLD and other smaller factions in UP in an attempt to sew up a Bihar-like `mahagathbandan' to check BJP's advance.
  

  

  Around this time, the Yadav family feud intensified.Kishor, who had insisted on a Priyanka-centric election campaign beginning in November and winding up by mid-January, changed gears after she decided to focus on seat-sharing talks rather than campaigning. By December, Akhilesh, on the verge of heading out on his own, was more agreeable to an SP-Congress alliance than earlier. Kishor prepared a list of around 150 constituencies that Congress believed it deserved to contest.With party vice-president Rahul Gandhi abroad on vacation, it was Priyanka who held the first closed-door meeting with Akhilesh.

Read MoreSOME PERTINENT POINTS TO PONDER FOR BJP AFTER THE ELECTION TO THE 5 ASSEMBLIES: 1. Copy & run in every state in India exactly the same kind of effective & successful anti-sickular campaign, with the same kind of candidates, if the situation is the same as in UP, with a triangular fight. But, in the coming elections the Opposition parties are going to unite at all costs, as they now have understood that they don't stand a chance against the good & patriotic BJP, if they don't engage it in straight contests, after forming a grand united front. 2. To defeat such a sure front, BJP must a. increase its mass support in every state in India with a. a battery of good & popular measures immediately, b. work out an effective strategy to divide, destroy & weaken the Opposition & c. simultaneously form formidable & useful allies itself. 3. As a modern & progressive party, BJP will never get the support of anachronistic, sickular & reactionary parties like CON & BSP & perhaps even SP, despite its getting itself worsted at the hustings due to its alliance with the tainted, unpopular & fast eclipsing CON. 4. Therefore, it is now extremely important that BJP delivers its 2014 poll promises immediately, by jailing all the corrupt regardless of party affiliations, retrieving the whopping multi-trillion loot, instantly returning half of it as a one time deposit in the bank account of all citizens & investing the rest in infrastructure, jobs, welfare, defence etc from which it was misappropriated by we know who all 1947-2017 & thereby upgrading India as the richest, most powerful & best welfare nation on earth, as it really deserves to be. 5. Such an action has only advantages. It will annihilate all of PM Modi's, BJP's & India's enemies in one single blow & also effectively prevent progressive parties like CPM, CPI, TMC, JDU, AAP etc from joining hands with CON & its sickular allies, but would want to form an alliance with BJP, for sheer survival or even go it alone & perish. They already regret not supporting the demonetization, digitization & modernization by BJP, as it has cost them dearly in terms of public support. All the existing allies of BJP except one or two tainted/unpopular ones also must be taken good care of. This is a must for BJP to win in 2019 & get a majority big eneough to make all necessary Contitution Amendments easy. 6. BJP must aslo analyze thoroughly & learn why it got decimated in Punjab & lost its top position in Goa & avoid all such mistakes it in the future. 7. BJP must fulfill all the electoral promises in all the BJP-riuled states & also address effectively all the problems facing the citizens there, on a war footing. If not, BJP will surely lose in 2019 & India will then be lost to mega thugs & super criminals forever & ever.Srikumar Hariharan

  

  When Rahul returned, it was to negotiations on a brink of collapse. Akhilesh was unwilling to concede more than 105 seats to the Congress, with seat-sharing in the Gandhi bastions of Amethi and Rae Bareli the contentious area. SP, which had won seven of the 10 assembly seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli in 2012, was agreeable to half-and-half arrangement, but Priyankapushed for Congress contesting all the seats there.
  

  

  If Priyanka was the pivot of the backroom management, Kishor was responsible for the joint election campaign. Team PK and a section of the party believed the `UP Ko Ye Saath Pasand Hai' campaign had the pulse of the people, but the decisive results on Saturday proved this show of youthful friendship didn't quite cut it for UP."

  BJP national secretary Srikant Sharma defeated Congress Legislative Party leader Pradeep Mathur with a margin of 1.01 lakh votes at Mathura constituency. Mathur, a four-time winner from the seat, was no lightweight, but could poll only 42,200 votes.
  

  

  In Chhata, BJP candidate Laxmi Narayan bagged a total of 1.17 lakh votes, followed by Atul Singh (independent), a distant second with 53,699 votes. In Baldev, Pooran Prakash, sitting MLA from the Rashtriya Lok Dal, who joined the BJP before the elections, retained the seat with 88,411 votes, while RLD candidate Niranjan Singh Dhangar polled 75,203.

  Over the years, the BJP had showed patchy performance in the district. Its candidates had won in only a few seats — from Mathura city in 1996, Gokul in 1993, Chhatta in 1991 and Goverdhan in 2002, after which it had drawn a blank in all the elections. The saffron party has however, never opened its account in the constituency of Mant, which has been represented eight times consecutively by Shyam Sunder Sharma. The saffron party's campaigns had been hamstrung in the past by problems in expanding its cadre base and several rounds of infighting. This time, however, the BJP appears to have got its act together. With cadre presenting an energetic, united front, the party has shown the best results ever in the area.
  

  

  BJP national general secretary Srikant Sharma dubbed the party victory as 'Parivartan ki tsunami (tidal wave of change)'. He said, ""The voters have realized that the SP, BSP and the Congress are a hurdle to the development of the poor."" Giving the credit for the superlative performance in all the seats to his party workers, on being asked if he was a contender for the chief minister's post, Sharma said he was ""just a humble worker"" of the party."

  Out of power for two consecutive terms and drawing a blank in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP failed to strike a chord with the voters winning just 20 seats.
  

  

  Mayawati gave tickets to 97 Muslim candidates and inducted tainted MLA from Purvanchal Mukhtar Ansari, his brothers Afzal Ansari and Sigbatullah Ansari, and son Abbas. But that could not revive the party's fortunes.
  

  

  From conjuring up the image of an upper caste basher to the most significant symbol of social change, 61-year-old Mayawati's politics has come a long way in her career spanning over 30 years.
  

  

  Thrice lucky to get the support of other parties to form a coalition government, Mayawati discovered her real potential in state politics when the BSP formed a majority government on its own in 2007, riding on the formula of social engineering.
  

  

  The graduation of ""Dalit ki beti"" is well manifested in the iconic slogan of the party ""tilak-taraju aur talwar, inko maro jutey chaar"" eventually turning to ""haathi nahi Ganesh hai, Brahma Vishnu Mahesh hai"".
  

  

  Her rise from humble beginnings aptly described as ""miracle of democracy"" by former prime minister P V Narasimha Rao, attracted as much praise as controversy and gave her an iconic stature which her opponents can criticise but never ignore.
  

  

  Popularly referred to as 'Behenji', Mayawati's single- minded dedication to the ideals of B R Ambedkar and idea of social emancipation is said to have impressed Kanshi Ram who took her into his mentorship when he founded the Bahujan Samaj Party in 1984 and she made her first entry in Parliament in 1989.
  

  

  Anointed on December 15, 2001 by Kanshi Ram as his successor, Mayawati was elected national president of the BSP on September 18, 2003 and there has been no looking back since then.
  

  

  Ever since her first brief tenure of four months in 1995 to her fourth term as chief minister which ended in 2012, she has earned the reputation of a firm and efficient administrator, especially on the law-and-order front.

  She not only got her own legislators, accused in cases like land-grabbing, arrested and sent high-profile criminals and mafia dons behind bars but also ensured that peace and communal amity was maintained at the most crucial times like passage of the Ayodhya verdict in 2010.
  

  

  The reputation of a no-nonsense leader which later went on to become her USP came her way through massive transfers and suspensions of senior IAS, IPS and other officials and also established her solid hold among the state's babus.

  She is also accused of following an autocratic lifestyle in the party as well as in the government in which both leaders and officials have to walk barefoot and she is considered as the last word.
  

  

  Her move of installing her own statues alongside Kanshi Ram is some of the memorials and describing herself as the ""saviour of the underprivileged"" also indicate her desire for reverence, her critics say."

  For the past 43 years, whichever party has won Kasganj - constituency number 100 in EC's list - has been able to form a government in the state. From Congress in 1974 to Samajwadi Party in 2012, all parties which eventually formed the government had conquered this seat, making it a bellwether constituency to watch.
  

  

  Contesting for the first time, Devendra Singh Rajput said, ""Once again this constituency proved that road to Lucknow passes through Kasganj, though literally the district is slightly off the Agra-Lucknow national highway, BJP Devendra Singh Rajput win.""
  

  

  ""I have been active in the constituency as a social worker since a long time. Our party workers did a lot of hard work to make me win. The overwhelming support during campaigning has translated into votes and now we will take UP to new heights and work for the betterment of people,"" he said.
  

  

  With the Lodhs in majority in a constituency of 3.44 lakh voters, BJP's Devendra Singh Rajput, a Lodh, received 1,01,908 votes in his favour while his immediate rival SP's Hasrat Ullah Sherwani received only 49,878.
  

  

  In 1974, Manpal Singh won Kasganj on an Indian National Congress ticket which formed the government in the state. After the Emergency, Janata Party swept the state and country alike. That year, Netram Singh became the Janata Party's MLA from Kasganj.
  

  

  Six years later in 1980, the Congress was back in power, as was Manpal Singh in Kasganj. He won another election in 1985, as did the Congress in UP.
  

  

  In 1989, Mulayam Singh Yadav, a member of the then Janata Party, became the CM of the state. In Kasganj, the winning MLA, Goverdhan Singh, again belonged to Janata Party.
  

  

  Two years later, in 1991, the BJP made history by winning a clear majority in the state. Kalyan Singh, who was himself from Lodh community, became the chief minister, and Netram Singh was back as the Kasganj MLA on a BJP ticket.

  In the Lodh-dominated area, Kalyan Singh himself contested from here and won the seat in 1993. Although the result was a hung assembly, Kalyan Singh's BJP was the single largest party. However, eventually an SP-BSP alliance formed the government in the state.
  

  

  BJP's Netram Singh was back here in 1996. Again, it was a hung assembly with the BJP as the single largest party. In 2002, the Samajwadi Party replaced the BJP as the single largest party, and SP's Manpal Singh was back.

"BJP's huge win had polarisation recipe, too","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjps-huge-win-had-polarisation-recipe-too/articleshow/57597645.cms","LUCKNOW: Success of the Bharatiya Janata Party in any election and especially in UP assembly poll without treading the polarisation path would be an incomplete story. Even though caste and high voltage campaigning may have played an important role, but the polarisation effect had its fair share with statements by Prime Minister Modi like ""kabristaan-shamsaan,"" and using Mahant Yogi Adityanath to campaign extensively couple with low intensity communal incidents, too playing a role.
  

  

  West UP region of the state turning out to be a tried and tested laboratory for polarisation for the BJP ever since Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013 and a clean sweep from the region in 2014 Lok Sabha election, UP assembly poll would not have been different.
  

  

  However, more than the requirement of motormouths to tread the polarisation agenda, the BJP strategists went for an attacking strategy and showed no hitch in including many contentious issues like triple talaq, Ram temple, closure of abattoirs and anti-Romeo squad in the party's 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra'.
  

  

  What the party needed was polarising figure to take up these issues in the West UP region. Unlike previous elections, when firebrand Gorakhpur MP Mahant Yogi Adityanath was utilised in a limited manner and mainly in eastern UP region, the party strategistst showed hitch this time in roping him in the sensitive West UP region. Yogi no wonder came true on the expectation of the BJP strategists with statements like situation in Kairana is like Jammu and Kashmir and raking up anti-Romeo squad.
  

  

  Next in the plan was UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, who before joining the BJP, had been the Vishwa Hindu Parishad general secretary. Besides, helping the party in consolidating OBCs, Maurya's pro-Hindutva image also led to polarisation effect especially in the region.
  

  

  Both Yogi and Maurya together addressed over 30 rallies in West UP region alone.
  

  

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself a polarising figure before taking over as PM owing to Godhara riots, however, remained focused on political rhetorics than treading the communal line in his speeches until he remained in West UP region.
  

  

  However, after the first four phases, the PM came up statements like: If there is electricity during Ramadan then it must be provided during Diwali as well.
  

  

  Also, if there is a `kabristan' in the village, it should have a cremation ground too and added that the BJP believes in `Sabka saath, sabka vikas'.

  In between, the interviews of these leaders and statements on issues like triple talaq, closure of abattoirs and mention of the state government willing to become party for Muslim women on contentious triple talaq issues, if BJP comes in power, also lead to a divide among the voters.
  

  

  No wonder, the BJP had all the recipes ready to ensure the party comes to power. The party has won on 327 seats out of possible 403 seats.

"Trampled twice in three years, RLD stares at political extinction","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/trampled-twice-in-three-years-rld-stares-at-political-extinction/articleshow/57596857.cms","MEERUT: With just 1.8% vote share, which translates to 15.45 lakh votes, and one seat in the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh assembly, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which had been wiped out in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, now stares at political extinction. Even in its stronghold of Baghpat district, of three seats it could manage to win just one, Chaprauli.
  

  

  The party had become steadily marginalized in the preceding elections, but had managed to hold on to its meager holdings in the past decade. In the 2002 assembly elections, 10 of its candidates had won, a tally which had been repeated in 2007. In 2012, 46 of its candidates had been in the fray but only nine had won, with a share of 2.33% of the total votes polled in the state.
  

  

  The party which looked certain to gain from apparent Jat anger against demonetisation and the central government's handling of the quota stir ended up losing its traditional voters' base once more.

  Organizational secretary of RLD for west UP, Rajkumar Sangwan, however, played down doomsday scenarios. ""Saying that RLD is on the verge of extinction is wrong. In any case ours is a regional party mainly concentrated in the western UP belt. The poll result clearly reflects anger against the state government's policy of appeasement. The 'Yadavization' of government machinery coupled with lenient attitude towards crime particularly when committed by a particular community left the voter with no choice. What SP was to Muslims, BSP is to Dalits. So the electorate was left with no choice but to look towards a third alternative and they knew that RLD could not form a government on its own so they opted for BJP. We are only the victims of the criminalisation of politics done by SP and BSP.""
  

  

  However, many in the RLD also felt that these elections were an opportunity lost. At a time when Jats, rattled by alleged state-sponsored violence on the community in Haryana during the quota stir, were looking to return to the RLD fold, the party could not capitalize on this issue. Nor could it work on the ill effects of demonetisation.

  ""No matter how big or small an organization is, cadre has its own importance. Imagine what a party worker will feel when suddenly turncoats are invited and given tickets, while dedicated workers are ignored. At a time when Jats were willing to come back to their own party, our leaders were busy accommodating the newcomers. The result is in front of everyone,"" said a senior leader of western UP.
  

  

  However, some felt polarization has forever dented the prospects of RLD as a political party. ""The Jat and Muslim combination was invincible till the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013. It was because of this combination that (RLD supremo) Ajit Singh won six times for the Lok Sabha from Baghpat. Despite our best efforts we were not able to bridge the yawning gap created by the polarisation after the riots,"" said another leader."

Further, only 24 Muslim candidates could win elections. Results declared on Saturday also indicated that SP-Congress alliance was the first choice of Muslims despite Mayawati going all out to woo minority community.
  

  

  The BSP gave tickets to 99 Muslim candidates, highest ever by any mainstream party in UP since Independence. She also got Mukhtar Ansari's Quami Ekta Dal merged with the BSP and took support from Muslim-dominated Rashtriya Ulama Council. Several Muslim outfits and clerics also appealed in BSP's favour.
  

  

  However, results show that of 140 assembly constituencies where Muslim population is 20% or above, BJP won 109 and its ally Apna Dal 2, SP won 23 and its ally Congress 3, while BSP got 2. This pollsters said indicates Muslims chose SPCongress alliance over BSP.
  

  

  These 140 seats are said to be key in winning UP elections. In 2012, when SP came to power with majority, it won 72 at constituencies, BSP 27 seats, BJP 25, Congress 11, RLD 1 and others four. In 2007, BSP had swept 40% of the total seats and also won elections.
  

  

  Though Muslims constitute 19% of UP's population, this time there will be drastic drop in their representation in the state assembly with only 24 (6% of the total 403 seats) candidates from the community winning elections. In 2012, total 69 Muslim candidates (17.12%), highest since independence, reached assembly and in 2007, 46% (11.90%). In 2012 and 2007, caste equations dominated elections, besides other issues.

  The lowest Muslim repre sentation in state assembly was 16 (4.05% of the total 419 seats then) in 1991when communal polarization took place due to Ram Temple movement and BJP came to power for the first time in the state with absolute majority. In 1993, in the elections held after Babri mosque demolition, only 24 (5.92%) Muslim candidates won.
  

  

  Analysts said that Muslim representation always comes down whenever there is pola rization on religious lives. In 1967 and 1969 when Gau Rakshan movement was at its peak, only 23 Muslims won elections on both occasions in UP.
  

  

  In this election, Mayawati's political engineering to bring together Dalit and Muslims failed as only five Muslim candidates out of total 99 fielded by the BSP, could win their seats. SP had given tickets to 57 Muslims, while Congress fielded 22 Muslims, of which only two won.
  

  

  In 2012, of 78 Muslim candidates fielded by SP, 43 won, while of 85 Muslims fielded by BSP , 16 won. Congress gave tickets to 62 Muslims, but four won. Two Muslims candidates won on Quami Ekta Dal ticket, one on Ittehad-E-Millat Council and three as Peace Party candidate. In 2007, SP fielded 58 Muslim candidates of which 21 won, BSP put up 61 of which 29 won, Congress fielded 49 but none won and RLD fielded three and all won."

Negligible, it turns out. A large number of prominent clerics had thrown their weight behind the BSP and campaigned for the party, but it seems their endorsement did not work for the party which was hoping to sweep the elections with the support of Dalit and Muslim votes combined.
  

  

  Maulana Syed Mohammad Ashraf Kichachauvi of All India Ulema and Mashiakh Board, who had spoken in support of the BSP, told TOI it was a good sign that the community has risen above caste, creed and religion and voted for development, and he respected the mandate.
  

  

  ""It is not that Muslims did not vote for the BSP. However, those votes could not transform into victory for the candidates. The vote share of BSP has not dwindled much this time and there is an urgent need to strengthen the party,"" Kichachauvi said. He also added that the community is hopeful of having an equal share in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas' agenda.
  

  

  In a word of advice, Imran Hasan Siddiqui, president of Al Imam Welfare Association, Lucknow, another BSP supporter, said party supremo Mayawati failed to connect with voters the way PM Narendra Modi did through his roadshows.
  

  

  ""Results are quite astonishing. The BSP could not make much use of the media to get exposure like the BJP or other parties did. Media coverage showed that the contest was only between the Samajwadi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Muslim voters were unable to decide who to vote - the SP or BSP. Besides, those who were traditional voters of the BSP also deserted the party,"" Siddiqui said. He added that a huge vacuum between voters and BSP leaders, including Mayawati, was formed and they failed to connect with the former. ""With changing times, the BSP also needed to change its campaign strategy. Despite security threat, PM Modi conducted a massive road show in an open vehicle. It gave a huge message,"" he said.

  With the start of election campaigning, BSP had gone all out to woo Muslim voters with the help of clerics and various organisations. The BSP leadership was successful in roping in Rashtriya Ulema Council led by Maulana Aamir Rashadi Madani, Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Maulana Ahmed Bukhari, noted Shia cleric and member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board Maulana Kalbe Jawwad and Maulana Syed Mohammad Ashraf Kichachauvi of Ulema and Mashiakh Board along with the AMU Students Union to extend its support towards the party.
  

  

  BSP chief Mayawati told minorities that voting for the SP-Congress alliance will go in vain and it will only help the BJP. A senior BSP leader, who did not wish to be named, reiterated allegations made by Mayawati that EVMs were tampered with. ""How it is possible otherwise that BSP won those seats where Muslims were a majority and where BJP was not sure of winning?"" he asked.
  

  

  Ashfaq Saifi, former national general secretary of BJP minority cell, said, ""People have shut shops of these so-called Muslim leaders. The community has woken up and learnt to fight its own battle. They have understood that SP and BSP were playing the politics of fear. In three years of PM Modi's tenure, Muslims are not only safe and secure, but also getting better facilities and education.""
  

  

  ""A large number of Muslim women also voted for the BJP because of the party's stand on the issue of triple talaq. They might have told their husbands that they will vote for the SP and the BSP but in stead pressed the BJP button. Clerics have antagonised them after lending support to triple talaq,"" he added."

  Every corner of the party office was celebrating with followers throwing kesariya (saffron coloured) gulaal on each other. Several rounds of phoolon ki holi and bursting of crackers added diverse shades to the colours of victory. But few skull caps turned many heads as they roared har har modi.. ghar ghar modi.. and gaye gaye gaye gaye gaye akhilesh (against SP's slogan of jai jai jai jai jai akhilesh).
  

  

  One of them was Wakif Mahmood Rufi, who flared the party flag with full vigour. ""I am here to tell everyone that Muslims are not averse to Modi or BJP,"" said the man who quit Samajwadi Party Mohalla Samiti after his party entered into a coalition with Congress Party. ""SP was no longer safeguarding interests of the community,"" he reasoned.

""We have been befooled for long... caste or religion are a somethings one cannot choose or change. But improving one's quality of life through development is surely in our hands,"" he said.

"BJP out of woods in UP recording biggest win since Independence","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-out-of-woods-in-up-recording-biggest-win-since-independence/articleshow/57597592.cms","LUCKNOW: What sounded like political rhetoric on May 26, 2016, when Union home minister Rajnath said at a rally in Shahjahanjpur that BJP's ""vanvas (exile)"" in UP was about to get over, turned prophetic after 10 months on Saturday.
  

  

  There was no phenomenon like the 'Modi wave' of 2014 but BJP did it once again with UP's third biggest victory since Independence winning 300+ seats and decimating two regional giants, ahead the 2019 Lok Sabha poll.
  

  

  Congress had won 388 seats out of 430 in 1952 assembly election, followed by Janata Party winning 352 out of 425 possible seats in post-Emergency 1977 assembly election. The unprecedented and extraordinary win was not only a referendum on Modi's demonetisation drive, it also brought to fore BJP's social engineering skills in the caste-ridden politics of UP, which went hand-in-hand with polarisation. The huge victory of 324 seats out of 403 has the nod of the common man.
  

  

  The results are an indication of a new phenomenon that has emerged in this election—polarisation of the classes. While the pro-rich were heard protesting against the PM's move of demonetisation, the pro-poor were unnerved and instead, being happy over the fact that rich had to stand in queue.
  

  

  With a huge chunk of OBCs and Dalits falling in pro-poor category, their consolidation, especially of non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits through demonetisation coupled with projection of many OBC and Dalit leaders like UP BJP chief and Phulpur MP Keshav Prasad Maurya, besides former Leader of Opposition and a new entrant in BJP Swami Prasad Maurya and Agra MP Prof Ramshanker Katheria only helped the BJP further its cause.
  

  

  The shortfall in selection of candidates or weak candidates was taken care of by the Modi magic, which was not perceptible througout the election campaign but emerged as a strong point in favour of the BJP.
  

  

  Unlike in Bihar, however, BJP strategists and researchers maintained a balanced approach while utilising the PM services and his magic, thus limiting him to only 23 rallies across the state as compared to about 31 rallies in Bihar. His jibes on parties and leaders was not only well-researched, it delivered keeping in mind the region where the PM would address the gathering.
  

  

  At Kannauj, a region where family feud in the Yadav clan of Samajwadi Party could have divided the people, the PM reminded Akhilesh that his alliance partner Congress had once plotted an attack on his father Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1984.

  BJP UP in charge Om Mathur said Modi once again emerged as their strongest point, though labour of party workers at ground level could not be overlooked.
  

  

  Unlike in the previous election, there was a balance on using polarising politics too with the likes of Mahant Yogi Adityanath and UP BJP chief Keshav Maurya being used maximum in West UP region, an area which has seen polarisation ever since Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013.

  Though major losses were mainly from the Opposition benches, former chief of UP BJP Laxmikant Bajpayi's defeat in Meerut along with the drubbing of Mriganka Singh, daughter of Kairana MP Hukkum Singh at the hands of Rafique Ansari of Samajwadi Party and Nahid Hasan also of Samajwadi Party respectively, were the few major losses.
  

  

  With the huge win, however, has come an equally huge resposibility for the BJP leaders to deliver on their promises like the issue of triple talaq, closure of abattoirs, Ram temple, anti-Romeo squad, waiving of farmers' loan and clearing sugarcane dues of the farmers from state exchequer in 14 days as failing to do so would endanger their prospects in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. So would be the selection of chief minister."

  Anti-incumbency, lack of BSP connect at ground level and a divided Muslim vote led to a surprise win for the turncoat Thakur Dhirendra Singh who switched ranks from the Congress to the saffron party. Singh won with a margin of 22, 169 votes defeating the sitting candidate Vedram Bhati in the BSP stronghold.
  

  

  Jewar, which has seen a BSP candidate winning from the past three assembly elections, had the closest competition among all the three constituencies of Gautam Budh Nagar. While Noida and Dadri were clean sweeps, Jewar saw a tough fight which remained undecided till the 10th round of counting when both the BJP and BSP were at a difference of around 500 votes.
  

  

  Result was announced after the 25th round.
  

  

  Dadri has seen a return of the BJP after almost a decade when Nawab Singh Nagar was the constituency's MLA from October 1996 to May 2007.
  

  

  The latter was lobbying for a ticket from Dadri this time but was denied. Tejpal Nagar who had quit the BSP to join the BJP ahead of the 2014 general elections, was given a ticket from the party.
  

  

  Nagar's supporters had reached Delhi to protest against the candidature of Tejpal Nagar in the run up to the polls. Similarly, the BJP had faced protests for fielding Thakur Dhirendra Singh, an old Congressman who switched ranks shortly before the assembly polls on January 8.
  

  

  Even the losing candidates admitted that the Muslim vote was divided.
  

  

  Satveer Gurjar, who has been winning the Dadri seat for the past two assembly elections lost to BJP's Tejpal Nagar by 80, 140 votes.
  

  

  ""Polarisation led to the votes going to Modi. They have sold fake dreams,"" Gurjar told TOI.
  

  

  However, he denied that the rural vote bank shifted to BJP.

  Vedram Bhati, who won the Jewar seat in 2012 defeating closest rival Thakur Dhirendra Singh, who was then standing for the Congress said that along with anti-incumbency, it was a weak candidate from the Gurjar community standing from the SP-Congress alliance that led to the votes falling in Dhirendra Singh's lap.
  

  

  ""Had there been a strong candidate against me, votes would not have got transferred to the BJP,"" he said.
  

  

  The result suggested that even the traditional Congress votes went to Dhirendra Singh despite his switch.
  

  

  ""I had an expectation that I will win with a margin over 50, 000 votes and will get 1, 25, 000 votes in total. But, votes have come from every village, every booth and I have received love from all the people and it is more than enough for me. The winning margin does not matter,"" Singh told TOI."

A section of BJP leaders unhappy with him had been painting him as an arrogant man not ready to listen to others. Shah, no wonder had the eye to recognise Bansal's capabilities. With BJP getting absolute majority, the backroom boy of the UP BJP, Sunil Bansal is at the forefront.
  

  

  Just before Lok Sabha election, the Rashtriya Swayemsewak Sangh had decided to send Bansal to Uttar Pradesh to assist Shah who was then UP in charge. It was the first time both met each other, Bansal had once told TOI. The six months he spent during Lok Sabha election in UP gave him the experience of politics in the state. ""This is one state where politics is in the air,"" he said, talking to TOI.
  

  

  Back in UP as organisation secretary, Bansal changed the social combination of the party. With Shah's support, Bansal managed to appoint an additional 1,000 office-bearers from booth to state level from OBCs, MBCs and Dalit caste. Instead of replacing OBCs and Dalits with upper caste office-bearers, he added them to the existing strength.
  

  

  He then selected around 150 workers to look after the BJP organisations' day-to-day functioning and ensured that 95% of his team comprised members of the state. ""They were workers who had the zeal to work passionately for the party and were tech-savy too,"" Bansal said.
  

  

  After UP BJP registered over 2 crore members, the party's next task was to strengthen the booth. The BJP organisation secretary launched a drive of a sorts to form booth committees. Of the 1.47 lakh booths across the state, the BJP organisation managed to have effective committees on at least 1.08 lakh booths.

  BJP also had to work hard on shedding its tag of being an urban party. It was Bansal's idea that the party contested panchayat elections. He faced resentment over the decision but with support of UP in charge Om Mathur and then UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpayi, BJP contested panchayat election and though it could win 327 seats, it remained runner-up in another 300-odd panchayats and lost in another over 300 panchayats by a meagre margin of around 100 votes. But ultimately, the party got over 1,000 rural leaders.
  

  

  BJP organisation wooed voters at micro level by organising youth, women and Dalit meets at vidhan sabha constituency level. Bansal ensured the party marked its presence on social media and facilitated monitoring of programmes being held througout the state on social media media. He directed his team to form various WhatsApp groups to ensure the progress of these programmes was updated.
  

  

  Bansal and his team meanwhile carried out a survey to ascertain possible candidates from each vidhan sabha constituency. Four different surveys were made about six months back, Bansal told TOI and added that candidates were selected after looking at the surveys.
  

  

  ""We managed to ensure a social combination even in ticket distribution,"" shared Bansal, amid receiving greetings from all and sundry at the party office."

It was in 1985 that BSP fielded her from Bijnor for Lok Sabha elections and again in 1989, when she was elected for the first time. For 10 years, she worked in the region and gained experience as a politician and mastered the art of caste politics. Even in the 2014 general elections, she started her campaign from Bijnor. While in 2007 UP polls, BSP won all the seven seats of this district, in 2012 also, despite anti-incumbency factor, her party won four out of eight assembly seats. But this time, the party has been routed. Out of eight seats in Bijnor district, six have gone to BJP and two to SP, leaving nothing for BSP. This could be a game changer for the party in coming times.
  

  

  After the shattering defeat of the party, BSP veterans are now crestfallen and say the Dalit-Muslim combination might no longer work. Talking to TOI, BSP's former mandal coordinator Sarjeet Singh said, ""There are reasons for the defeat of the party not only in Bijnor but also in other parts of the state. First, we could not strike a balance among different communities. We had focused on Dalit-Muslim combination. In Bijnor, BSP fielded six Muslims out of eight seats, except two reserved seats, neglecting all other communities such as thakur, saini, jat, etc. BSP was completely trounced as all other communities united against the party and voted for BJP. Besides, a large number of Muslims joined the SP bandwagon. The Dalit-Muslim card proved a complete failure.""
  

  

  Singh further stated, ""The BSP leadership gives a cold shoulder to upcoming political stars in the party. Veterans and experienced leaders were sidelined before the polls.

"Demonetisation not an issue in Agra, Firozabad; BJP makes impressive win","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/demonetisation-not-an-issue-in-agra-firozabad-bjp-makes-impressive-win/articleshow/57598187.cms","AGRA: Despite losing their jobs after industries shut down due to cash crunch following demonetisation, industrial workers from Agra and Firozabad factories voted for BJP in the hope that a party, which is fighting corruption in a big way, will bring better days for them. The party won seven constituencies of the nine in Agra district and four of the five seats in Firozabad, putting to rest assumptions that these voters are angry with Modi over notebandi.
  

  

  Hundreds of glass, bangle, footwear and petha units were forced to shut down after the currency shortage, rendering tens of thousands of workers unemployed. Many workers believed the decision to demonetise high value notes was done to eliminate corruption and arrest those who had amassed wealth through illegal means. Babu Ram Nishankh, 82, leader of a workers' association at one of Firozabad's bangle industries, said, ""Prime minister Narendra Modi's policy on notebandi struck a chord with workers who saw it as a move to bring equality among all sections of society. Despite facing criticism from his detractors, Modi kept speaking in favour of the poor during his rallies and this has borne results. People have reposed their faith in him and are hopeful that better days lie ahead for them.""

  According to latest reports, 90 out of 100 bangle factories had downed their shutters because of the cash crunch, and more than 1.35 lakh labourers were out of jobs since the demonetisation was announced in November last year. Workers, however, appear confident that if they can throw SP and BSP out of power in the state, they can also show the door to BJP if the party failed to fulfill its promises. ""No doubt, there was anger against notebandi among workers. Things, however, improved later and the poor people were able to get their jobs back,"" Nishankh added.
  

  

  Airing similar sentiments, Puttu Singh, former state vice-president of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, said, ""People have voted for change, thinking that a new government will work towards their betterment. Workers think if Modi ji can take a major decision to curb black money, it would not be too difficult for the PM to implement stringent labour laws in the industrial sector. Post-demonetisation, efforts are being made to open bank accounts of workers so that their wages go directly to these accounts.""

  Puran Dawar, president of Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), said, ""The election results have proved beyond doubt that demonetisation had no negative impact on people's minds. People from all strata of life came forward to vote for PM Modi not only in UP but in other states as well. Demonetisation was a revolutionary step by the central government to purge the system of corruption.""
  

  

  Rajesh Aggarwal, secretary of Noori Darwaza Petha Union, said, ""No doubt that our sector was badly hit by notebandi and workers had to sit idle at home, but it was a temporary phase. Today, things are back to normal. Workers saw voting for BJP as an attempt at indicting the corrupt."""

This time round, BJP avoided the pitfalls of strident election rhetoric and steered clear of self-goals such as RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's comments on quotas. Decisions on ticket distribution were carefully calibrated and local leaders were involved in every aspect of decision-making.
  

  

  BJP stuck to a fairly large bouquet of issues, ranging from Hindutva concerns like a ban on mechanised slaughterhouses and Romeo squads to welfare schemes such as farm loan waivers and a package for Bundelkhand. Apart from showcasing PM Narendra Modi as its poll mascot, the party cut its reliance on central leaders, and gave sufficient space to state leaders.
  

  

  Candidates were carefully chosen to reflect a caste balance spectrum with focus on non-Yadav OBCs. Three candidates were chosen from each constituency, and the MP had a major say . Candidates who had suffered successive defeats were not considered despite protests.State president Keshav Prasad Maurya, state general secretary (organisation) Shiv Kumar and national vice president Dinesh Sharma, were assigned the task of identifying candidates who were further vetted by BJP chief Amit Shah with poll managers like Sunil Bansal playing a key role.

  The campaign narrative had two distinct strands. While party seniors stuck to the development agenda, local functionaries focused on micro issues to strike a chord with the voters. BJP's cause received a boost when the Dayashankar Singh-Swati Singh episode happened. After making slanderous remarks against BSP supremo Mayawati, BJP member Dayashankar was sacked as state general secretary. But the equally offensive diatribe by BSP functionaries against Dayashankar's wife Swati polarised upper castes against Mayawati.
  

  

  The election results show a rare convergence of Brahmins and Thakurs, who together constitute around 19% of voters. Firebrand Hindutva speaker Yogi Adityanath criss-crossed the state. Sensing legal hurdles, the party was pragmatic and didn't make fresh promises on the Ram temple and reiterated its construction through Constitutional means.

  Unlike Bihar, state leaders led from the front during 'parivartan' rallies with 'nukkad' meetings and direct interaction with the people as the highlights. Modi and Shah were reserved for the bigger occasions.

  The SP's road ahead now appears difficult; among its primary challenges are keeping the clan war in the Yadav family from re-erupting and addressing the resentment among senior members who have been defeated.
  

  

  The result can be seen as a verdict on the SP government, which was mired in controversies involving corruption, lawlessness and nepotism, and shows that the people were not taken in by the SP's attempt to hard-sell Akhilesh as a clean and development-oriented leader.
  

  

  The size of the BJP's victory demonstrates that the ground realities highlighted by it hurt the young CM: poor law and order, a free run to the `bhu' (land) mafias and preferential recruitment.UP's voters reposed faith in Modi's promise to end the ""karobaar of bahubalis"" when BJP came to power.
  

  

  ""The results show that the UP CM's good image was diluted by controversies related to land grabbing, nepotism in government recruitment and the impression of lawlessness that prevailed for a large part of his tenure. The party failed to convince voters,"" said a political analyst. It seems the SP's ""thuggish"" image affected the party , and Akhilesh's laudable initiatives, such as the `ambulance sewa' and an emergency crime helpline, came too late for any meaningful impact.

  The SP narrative, like the one put forth by its Gorakhpur district chief, Prahlad Yadav, that ""SaPa ne goondo ko kinara kar liya hai. Sab ab jail mein sarh rahe hain (SP has thrown anti-social ele ments into jail)"", failed to convince people.
  

  

  Even younger voters seem to have chosen Mod over the ""UP ke ladke"" as Modi's aggressive pitch against the Samajwad Party government's al leged discrimination in recruitment processes res onated among them.

  The SP tried to counter BJP's promise to set up ""anti-Romeo squads near colleges to ensure the safety of girls but Dimple Yadav's reply that the BJP promise was an attempt to go after the freedom women enjoy in a college or university environment, and that the squads would become ""anti Romeo-Juliet squads"" that harass couples, went unheeded. And BJP managed to cash in on the insecurity among young women due to poor law and order.

"How BJP beat Maya, Mulayam at their caste card game","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/how-bjp-beat-maya-mulayam-at-their-caste-card-game/articleshow/57597158.cms","LUCKNOW: Known so far for playing mandir, polarisation and development cards and even after getting branded as a party of upper castes and baniyas, BJP this time used the caste formula, a forte of Mulayam and Mayawati that kept the two regional parties in power for around 15 years.
  

  

  From selection of candidates to anointing Keshav Maurya state president a year ahead of polls, welcoming strong OBC leaders like former Leader of Opposition Swami Prasad Maurya from other political parties and targeting sections like non-Yadav, OBCs & non-Jatav Dalits, the BJP this time succeeded in trumping SP and BSP on their home turf by cracking the caste code.
  

  

  Expanding support base among non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits was first made under Kalyan Singh and the outreach, helped by the Ram Mandir campaign, paid rich dividends too. In 1991, BJP led by Kalyan Singh rode to power with 221 seats, won 177 in 1993 and bagged 174 seats in 1996.
  

  

  But by late 1990s, it was abandoned after Kalyan Singh left the BJP and leaders like Rajnath Singh, Kalraj Misra, Kesarinath Tripathi took centrestage. By 2002, the BJP could win only 88 seats. That was the time Mulayam Singh-led Samajwadi Party with 143 seats and Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party with 98 seats emerged as two principal players.
  

  

  The first attempt to revive the social coalition was made by Amit Shah who paid heed to Kalyan Singh's suggestions. Modi's own appeal as the first ""backward' to have made it to the PMO on his own steam was another factor. During Lok Sabha election, Amit Shah came to UP as its in charge.
  

  

  The first sign of BJP shifting back to wooing non-Yadav OBCs was evident when it fielded 25 OBCs, 17 Brahmins, 14 Thakurs, 17 Dalits, 3 Vaishays and one Pasi and Bhumihar each, while tickets for two seats were given to Apna Dal. A total 27 tickets were given to OBC candidates including the Apna Dal.
  

  

  BJP ended up making a record of sorts with party and alliance candidates together winning 73 out of possible 80 seats. With over two years left for assembly election, national BJP chief BJP Rajnath Singh, who became Union Home Minister in Modi cabinet, was replaced with Amit Shah as the party chief. Like Lok Sabha election, the BJP had set goal of winning UP assembly election and Shah knew that without wooing non-Yadav and non-Jatav Dalits, it would not be possible.
  

  

  They began wooing non-Yadav OBCs early. In March 2015, Shah wasted no time in accepting invitation from Anil Rajbhar, then a SP leader, to address a rally. ""Today is the beginning of bringing backward castes and other castes under a single umbrella. This is necessary because despite reservation policy, only one caste (Yadavs) is getting all benefits meant for all Backward Castes,"" Shah had said, addressing the 'Adhikar Paao Maharally' on March 23 in Varanasi. Shah inducted over 15,000 members of the Rajbhar community into the BJP.
  

  

  Shah went to Bahraich to garland the statue of Suheldev Pasi, a king who stopped Salar Jung's accession. Shah continued with such moves quite regularly. In the same way, the BJP leadership also focussed on non-Jatav Dalits. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ravidas Temple in Varanasi was seen as one such move.
  

  

  In the meantime, the party strategists also were on job not only to woo prominent OBC leaders into the party fold but also to project OBC leadership of the BJP. No wonder, appointment of Phoolpur MP Keshav Prasad Maurya as UP BJP chief was one such move. The attempt was to woo about 8% of Kushwaha, Maurya, Shakya and Saini community.
  Hmt Ladies Designer Wrist WatchShopcluesKnow the first step of financial planningMAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  

  Many such decisions mobilised OBCs. Demonetisation decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, against Opposition's claims of angering the middle class, polarised the pro-poor, who also belong largely to OBC and Dalit communities, and further united them against the pro-rich.
  

  

  When it came to ticket distribution, the BJP leadership was generous to OBCs who got over 40% tickets out of 403. Party strategists like UP in charge Om Mathur and organisation secretary Sunil Bansal further ensured that OBC leaders like Keshav Maurya, Swami Prasad Maurya, Swatantra Deo Singh and others are utilised maximum and address rallies in a bid to woo OBC voters.
  

  

  According to a rough estimate, UP BJP chief Keshav Maurya addressed around 200 rallies across the state.
  

  

  It is, thus, not surprising that BJP won around 290 seats out of 403. Next goal beng now 2019 Lok Sabha election, it would be interesting to see whether the CM is from OBC or Dalit category."

Though the BJP won hands down in all five seats of the district, margins of victory were higher in urban seats compared to those seats where the voter base was rural. This was the main reason for the highest victory margins in Sahibabad and Muradnagar, which have primarily urban voters.
  

  

  In Sahibabad assembly seat, which includes the urban areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara and Kaushambi, BJP candidate Sunil Sharma trounced his nearest rival Amarpal Sharma by a margin of over 1.5 lakh votes. BJP has won the seat despite the fact that Amarpal Sharma has a huge vote bank in Khoda colony which is located on the borders of Delhi.

  The second highest margin of victory for the BJP in the district has been in Muradnagar seat. The two upscale areas of the district, Kavi Nagar and Raj Nagar, are in Muradnagar. Here, BJP's Ajit Pal Tyagi trounced his nearest rival, Sudhan Rawat of the BSP, by a margin of over 89,000 votes. Congress veteran Surendra Prakash Goel, who also contested from Muradnagar, bagged just 49,000 votes.

The string of massive victory margins continued in Ghaziabad seat too. The BJP candidate from Ghaziabad, Atul Garg, won the seat by trouncing his nearest rival, Suresh Bansal of the BSP, by a margin of over 70,000 votes.

  In no time, several media persons joined them and started giving live PTC (piece to camera). But the road was wearing a deserted look. SUVs came in, halted for a few seconds to assess the situation and then went away. Some even got down and walked up to the party office gate, but returned in no time. Policemen deployed there were quick to conclude the changing times. ""Parivartan ki bela hai..."" remarked one of them.
  

  

  The fragrance of incense sticks and 'havan samagri' drew the nose and took it to a small Hanuman Temple, about 50 metres away from the SP office. A party worker was quietly submitting 'ahutis' into the fire amidst the echo of Sundar Kaand (a religious chapter on the deity) paath. Photographs of Akhilesh Bhaiya and Dimple Bhabhi were placed before the deity to invoke his blessings. ""I am praying for our party's victory,"" said the devotee Ram Avtaar Yadav, a native of Azamgarh.
  

  

  Asked if he had seen the trends indicating BJP's landslide victory in UP, he said, ""Yes I have, but they are trends. I will not lose hope till the results are declared."" By 1 pm, trends grew stronger and SP's nosedive became a fact which disheartened a handful of supporters who were hoping against hope. In the evening, CM Akhilesh Yadav invited reporters to his official residence 5 Kalidas Marg for one last time.
  

  

  As Akhilesh told the media that he had accepted the verdict, a pall of gloom descended on the party office. An hour later, drizzle made a few pedestrians find shade near the office. One of them Mohan Kumar remarked, ""Indra dev bhi khush hain kamal ke khilne se. (Even the rain god is happy with the blooming of lotus)."""

The Congress did only marginally better in Rae Bareli, the neighbouring constituency that Congress president Sonia Gandhi has held since 1998.
  

  

  Here, the party debuted on the Rae Bareli Sadar and Harchandpur seats, and conceded Unchahar to alliance partner SP, and the remaining two, Sareni and Bachhrawan, to the BJP.
  

  

  Alliance leaders attribute the performance to the internal troubles over seat-sharing. Congress leaders -read Priyanka Gandhi Vadra -was keen to see the Congress contest on all 10 seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli.
  

  

  Even though this appeared a bad electoral decision -considering Congress had only won two of 10 in 2012 -Congress pressed for total control over all seats in twin VIP zones.

The author of the Kairana 'exodus' theory on Saturday found that it was his daughter and party candidate Mriganka Singh that voters had thrown out, so to speak, from the constituency.
  

  

  Kairana, a restive west UP town, figured prominently in political speeches of BJP leaders as they repeated Hukum Singh's contention that there had been a consistent 'exodus' of Hindus from the place. Party president Amit Shah, Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and a host of others promised to stop the ""injustice"" if the party came to power. Ironically, even as the BJP swept the entire ""riot belt"" of west UP, Kairana slipped out of its hands.

  Kairana had become a poll issue months before the actual declaration of election dates and was aggressively highlighted by the BJP, with the entire narrative being spearheaded by Hukum Singh himself.
  

  

  But there was a twist in the tale waiting for Hukum Singh. The moment he managed to hoist his daughter up as the candidate from the seat, the party split down the middle, with Anil Kumar, a party veteran from the region, raising the banner of revolt. He later joined RLD along with his supporters and was rewarded with a ticket by Ajit Singh. Although Anil Singh polled just 19,992 votes, the internal party friction sealed the fate of the BJP in the constituency.

And in the end, the 47-year-old backroom boy, did prove his worth, despite a section of the BJP ganging up against him and projecting him as an arrogant man who does not listen to others.
  

  

  Just before the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the RSS decided to send Bansal, who had once been ABVP's general secretary in Jaipur, to Uttar Pradesh to assist Shah, who was then the UP in-charge. It was the first time both met.The six months he spent during the Lok Sabha elections in UP gave him the right experience. ""This is one state where politics is in the air,"" he said.
  

  

  Back in UP as organisation secretary this time, Bansal changed the social combination of the party. With Shah's support, Bansal managed to appoint an additional 1,000 office-bearers from booth to state level from OBCs, MBCs and dalit caste.Instead of replacing OBCs and dalits with upper-caste office-bearers, he added them to the existing strength.

  He then selected around 150 workers to look after BJP's day-to-day functioning and ensured that 95% of his team comprised members of the state. ""They were workers who had the zeal to work passionately for the party and were tech-savvy , too,"" Bansal said.
  

  

  After UP BJP registered over two crore members, the party's next task was to strengthen the booth. Bansal then launched a drive to form booth committees. Of the 1.47 lakh booths across the state, BJP managed to have effective committees on at least 1.08 lakh booths. BJP also had to work hard on shedding its 'urban party' tag. It was Bansal's idea that the party contest panchayat elections. He faced resentment over the decision but with support of UP in-charge Om Mathur, BJP contested panchayat elections and won 327 seats.
  

  

  The BJP wooed voters at the micro level by organising youth, women and dalit meets. Bansal ensured the party marked its presence on social media and facilitated monitoring of programmes being held throughout the state on social media.

From Mirzapur to Bharaich and Jalaun to Lucknow, through the 23 rallies, his message was the same: trust me, vote for me, I get the job done. Modi went into the campaign lumbered with the liability of demonetisation but turned it into a populist vote winner by emphasising that it was part of his anti-corruption, anti-rich campaign. From Hindu Hriday Samrat of Gujarat to Development Man in 2014, UP 2017 saw Modi re-invent himself as pro-poor welfarist. In Indira Gandhi style, Modi was the PM seeking to win a state election on the basis of his own persona, not through state leaders.

  Reaching directly across to the voter, promising them a war against the rich, UP 2017 evoked Indira Gandhi's bank nationalisation moment in 1969 when putting the rich in their place had become a vote-winner with the poor. Modi was able to stand forth as a champion of the poor. ""The suit boot ki sarkar charge did hit us,"" said a BJP member, adding, ""We went out of our way to change our image from pro-Ambani and Adani to create a coalition of the poor.""
  

  

  UP also saw a consolidation of the ""sab jaat versus teen jaat"", BJP's Kalyan Singh-style social engineering of 1991reinvented for 2017. This resulted in most backward castes, non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav dalits all clustering with BJP against the three castes -Jatavs, Yadavs and Muslims, represented by BSP , SP and Congress, who were pushed to become only subcaste fronts. Shedding its Brahmin-bania image, BJP created a wide social coalition of poor and backwards. It gave 119 seats to non-Yadav OBCs such as Rajbhars, Khushwahas and Mauryas. BJP even struck an alliance with the littleknown Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party -a party of Rajbhars -and gave them eight tickets.They also gave 69 tickets to non-Jatav dalits, such as Dhobis and Khatiks. The Ujwala gas scheme, soil card, rural housing and toilet construction schemes led to BJP making inroads among the poor and Modi being projected as the guardian of the garib.

  Modi's speeches were full of droll black comedy; colourful, often crass, language; and mimicry, theatrically delivered with dramatic pauses. It's a performance that the droning voice of Mayawati dully reading out her speeches can hardly match. In Meerut, he spoke of the other parties as ""SCAM""; in Bharaich, he countered Akhilesh by yelling that the humble donkey was a source of inspiration; in Fatehpur, he made the shamshan-kabristan speech, showing that at heart he remains a Hindu nationalist, a revelation that touched a chord across traditional UP. A populist lone crusader against corruption and a man of the masses who had risen from humble origins was the Modi identity on offer in 2017: Hindu hriday samrat combined with pro-poor populism harked back to the Indira Gandhi persona of patriotic heroine of the people."

Son Akhilesh attempted to correct this image deficit by taking on the old guard and its ""old politics"" and by softening the party's caste dependency. But Saturday showed these up as politically inadequate.

  The 2017 mandate+
  has created doubts about the 43-year-old's leadership and political acumen. With no returns to show for the high-profile internecine feud or for
  embracing the Congress+
  , Akhilesh is set to face serious questions, the challenge compounded by the fact that the poll defeat will embolden inhouse rivals like uncle Shivpal. Already, Shivpal,
  ousted as state party president+
  by his nephew, has described the party's defeat as a mandate against the ""arrogance"" of the party leadership.
  

  

  The post-defeat years will test Akhilesh as a politician. The chief ministership came on a platter after the 2012 victory under Mulayam's leadership. Now, he is on his own. And the challenges are massive, not the least the return to pole position of BJP that adroitly melded Mandal and Kamandal into a winning formula. In light of this, the traditional rivalry against BSP is a smaller challenge.
  

  

  Akhilesh's decision on an alliance with the Congress is being closely assessed. His father had openly expressed his disapproval on the move, as had uncle Shivpal. As an example of the sort of questioning his decisions will face in the coming days, Ravidas Mehrotra, the party candidate from Lucknow Central, complained, ""I would have won the election, but for the Congress. Its candidate refused to withdraw despite our alliance and ensured my defeat.""
  

  

  Akhilesh has been decisive in opting for a new political agenda for SP. He tried to ease the caste identity of his father's platform, preferred to contest on the development plank, sewed up an alliance with the Congress, even threw his wife Dimple into the battle as a star campaigner -all against the wisdom of his anti-Congress father who always banked on social engineering and never on a woman family member to garner votes. And that is a page, many believe, which cannot be turned back. So, Akhilesh has his task cut out. And the urgency could not be greater. He has just two years before the 2019 general elections to come up with a party idiom that can prove competitive in the BJP era."

  In the end, when Tikait surrendered and offered an apology, it amplified the message that Mayawati had upended the social dominance of Jats to sweep western UP and the state to become chief minister.
  

  

  BJP's romp in western UP on Saturday in the face of calls from the Jat community for its defeat has again shown that the dominant group, roughly 2% of the state's population, may no longer enjoy the disproportionate importance in the socio-political landscape of the state.
  

  

  That the Jat revolt was not merely one of leaders but of the community could be assumed on evidence that RLD of Ajit Singh was in the fray and campaigned on the caste platform. The challenge appeared serious in the wake of anti-BJP calls from Jat activists around the issue of demonetisation and the demand for OBC status, and the last-minute dialogue that BJP chief Amit Shah had to open with community leaders with a desperate plea for support.
  

  

  What seems to have happened is that while a greater chunk of Jats may have voted against the BJP, the rest of the OBC Hindus as well as the upper castes coalesced around the saffron umbrella. The post-Muzaffarnagar polarisation played a role.These appear to have been enough in the first and second phases of polls when the western region voted.

  It is not just about BJP -like BSP in 2007 -managing to beat the so-called Jat veto, it is about its implications. Mandate 2017 has again hammered home the waning influence of Jats in steering the choice of smaller communities, among them the most backwards and the Dalits.

Half of the 100 tickets she had allotted to Muslim candidates were from this region, which has the largest concentration of voters from the community. However, none of the 50 in the fray won, while only five of the remaining 50 Muslim candidates of the party won elsewhere. Western UP was where Maya's grand experiment was nipped in the bud.
  

  

  In 2007, the BSP had banked on the social combine of Dalits and Brahmins. In 2017, it was seeking to return to power by combining Dalit and Muslim votes. In the longest list of Muslim candidates the party had ever fielded, it allotted tickets to 50 of west UP's 125 constituencies to Muslims. The region has 26% Muslim voters, much higher than the state total of 18% for the community. The gambit did not work.
  

  

  ""By focusing on the Muslim-Dalit combine, the party did not focus on the backward classes in UP, which make up nearly 52% of the total population. While the Dalit vote is still secure and has gone to the BSP, the Muslim vote got split between SP and BSP, due to which the party did not perform as expected,"" a BSP leader told TOI.
  

  

  Out of the 19 seats on which the party emerged victorious, only five were won by Muslims —Mohd Aslam (Bhinga), Aslam Chaudhary (Dholana), Shah Alam (Mubarakpur), Mohd Mujtaba Siddiqui (Pratappur) and Mukhtar Ansari (Mau). In western UP, the party drew a blank.

  ""The BJP victory is a wave of Hindutva. In India, if politics is done on the basis of religion, Hindus being in the majority will emerge victorious against any social combine. But the question remains: how will a decision that is not endorsed by the oppressed Dalits and the otherwise on the decline Muslim community work for the betterment of the country?"" said Chandra Bhan Prasad, Dalit thinker from Delhi.
  

  

  The BSP was in the news during the campaign for changing its methods of connecting with the masses, by making a debut on social media and also getting friendlier with the media. But the results made it evident that the masses still could not connect well with the party and its policies.

  A senior party leader told TOI, ""The party has also realized that the distance it maintains from the media has contributed to the defeat, because while the BJP and SP remained in the news, BSP could hardly remain in the limelight. But we hope to work on these issues.""
  

  

  Satish Prakash, Dalit activist and political analyst, said, ""Media has the ability to change the decisions of the masses. Since BSP hardly got proper media coverage and was not in the news much, the masses voted for BJP. Also, we should not forget that at 22.2%, the vote share of the BSP is the largest after the BJP."""

In Dadri, BSP's two-time sitting MLA Satveer Gurjar lost to BJP's Tejpal Nagar by a margin of 80,140 votes.
  

  

  In Jewar, BSP's three-time MLA and party candidate Vedram Bhati lost to Thakur Dhirendra Singh by a margin of 22,169 votes.
  

  

  In 2012, Satveer Gurjar had won the assembly polls by defeating BJP's Nawab Singh Nagar by a margin of 37,297 votes. In the 2007 assembly polls, Gurjar had secured 75,346 votes and defeated Nawab Singh Nagar who got 50,923 votes. The Dadri seat is considered important to BSP as party chief Mayawati's native place, Badalpur, is located in this constituency. According to Satveer Gurjar, there polarisation of votes had led to the BJP victory. ""They polarised the political environment and the votes went in one direction,"" he said.
  

  

  Gurjar said the people did not vote for development. ""I never felt the people were unhappy with me,"" he said. When questioned on the shift of the BSP vote bank, he said there was no dent in the BSP's vote bank. ""We feel that the voters of other parties went to BJP which changed the political equations,"" he said.
  

  

  Vedram Bhati said BSP had a strong presence in the Jewar assembly constituency. ""I feel that except forf the BJP candidate, all other party candidates were weak. The other parties' votes shifted to BJP. I put up a tough fight against the BJP candidate but lost in the end,"" he said.

  Vinod Sharma, a journalist and a political analyst, said that though Mayawati's hometown is in Dadri, she hardly visits the town. ""There were also some cases of corruption that happened in Noida and Greater Noida authorities during her tenure as CM. The people of her constituency were not happy,"" he said. Sharma added that the Muslim votes were divided.
  

  

  Dr H Chaturvedi, director, BIMTECH, said that earlier people used to vote on caste and religious lines.

  Finishing fourth, after BSP's Rajeev Srivastava who won 24313 votes, Abdul Maroof Khan, Congress candidate from Lucknow Central, attributed the defeat to the `immature' alliance between the SP and the Congress. According to Khan, despite an alliance and fixed seats from where SP and Congress candidates would contest, there were many seats where both SP and Congress candidates were pitted against each other, and Lucknow Central was one of them. ""The party gave me ticket and the symbol. In elections, there is a winner and a loser. But when two people and that too in an alliance quarrel, someone else gains. Loss to both Congress and SP is irreparable,'' said Khan who won 12921 votes.
  

  

  He added, ""One seat has ripple effects. And so in constituencies where SP and Congress candidates contested separately too gave a poor performance.''

The party faced a restless Jat constituency and Mayawati was a real threat in this neck of the woods. But paradoxically, the hype whipped up by the SP-Congress alliance ended up helping BJP safely negotiate the treacherous terrain.
  

  

  The newly-minted SP-Congress pact prevented west UP's large Muslim population from rallying behind BSP, a development that would have spelt trouble for BJP. This, with discontent in the Jat ranks, could have hurt the saffron campaign.
  

  

  Though estimates vary, BJP chief Amit Shah's intervention with Jat leaders prevented large-scale desertions while several other communities, barring Muslims, backed the party. So, BJP emerged with a lead that only grew stronger as the election progressed across the state, with the final victory setting the scene for the party's bid to defend its Gujarat crown for a record sixth term. Narendra Modi's success in retaining Gujarat in 2012 set him on course for the prime minister-ship, and BJP hopes that he will repeat the feat.

  After the first two phases, Modi began to step up his tempo and pressed harder on the theme of ""discrimination"" in SP's governance by suggesting power supply during Ramzan was more regular than for Hindu festivals. He then swung out at SP again, with his comparison of government assistance to burial grounds as opposed to cremation arenas. Thereafter, Shah used the ""KASAB"" formulation to attack SP.
  

  

  Finally, when questions were raised about Modi's presence in his constituency Varanasi for three consecutive days holding roadshows, BJP responded by terming it a ""victory procession"" as party seniors grew increasingly confident that the party was home and dry.

  Though BSP requested EC to withhold declaration of poll results and order fresh elections in UP with paper ballots, the poll body was quick to reject her prayer as ""legally untenable"", saying that EVMs had repeatedly been found to be fool-proof and manipulation-free. The Commission cited several court judgments, including by the Supreme Court and several high courts, upholding the reliability of EVMs.
  

  

  ""Although the Commission has offered opportunities more than once to those alleging the tamperibility of EVM, no one has been able to demonstrate to the Commission that the EVM used in the country's election process, can be tampered with,"" the EC said in its reply to BSP's letter received on Saturday. It added that the Commission had put in place enough technical and administrative safeguards to ensure error-free functioning of EVMs in polls..
  

  

  It has almost become a fad for losing parties and candidates to cry wolf and blame EVM failure or tampering by the winning party. After the NDA's defeat in 2009, senior BJP leader L K Advani had cast doubts on the tamper-proof credentials of the EVM. As other parties like CPM, RJD and TDP jumped on to the bandwagon, the stage was set for introduction of a voter-verifiable paper audit trail of votes cast on EVMs.
  

  

  Before VVPAT technology was approved, multiple opportunities given by EC to Doubting Thomases to demonstrate how EVMs could be tampered, fell flat. Also, the Supreme Court and many High Courts like Madras High Court, Karnataka High Court, Mumbai High Court and Kerala High Court have dismissed petitions questioning the efficacy of EVMs, and confirmed their reliability.
  

  

  The tamper-proof technology of EVMs was originally endorsed by a committee of technical experts, comprising IIT professors and DRDO scientists, appointed at the initiative of Goswami committee on electoral reforms in 1990.

  Nevertheless, EVMs continue to end up as the convenient 'fall guy' for parties and candidates in the face of electoral defeat. AAP president Arvind Kejriwal had once questioned EVMs just ahead of Delhi assembly polls in 2015. He alleged that at least 4 machines, during a pre-election trial in Delhi Cantt constituency, recorded votes for BJP irrespective of which button was pressed. It is another thing that he totally forgot about the EVM issue after the AAP secured a landslide of 67 seats.
  

  

  Even during the current poll in Punjab, AAP complained to EC alleging a move to disturb EVMs by breaching the security of strongrooms where they had been stored after the February 4 polling.

  EC sources say Mayawati's reasoning that EVMs were tampered, based on the fact that the BJP had won even in the Muslim-dominated areas, only validates its call for introduction of totaliser machines. Totaliser technology ensures secrecy of booth-wise voting pattern, which could expose voters to intimidation. '
  

  

  A group of ministers had recently rejected the EC's suggestion for totaliser machines."
"Muslims miss 'sabka saath', down from 69 to 24 MLAs","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/muslims-miss-sabka-saath-down-from-69-to-24-mlas/articleshow/57602312.cms","LUCKNOW: In Uttar Pradesh, where Muslims comprise 19% of the population, the number from the minority community in the House has declined to 24. It's a marked difference from the 2012 polls when 69 Muslim MLAs entered the legislature.
  

  

  In a state where Muslims are a sizeable vote bank, BJP did not field a single Muslim in the 403 seats. Muslims have a strong presence in west UP, Rohilkhand, Terai and east UP, and they, along with Yadavs and Dalits, have been the core vote bank of Congress, SP and BSP. This social arithmetic traditionally made them key in candidate selection.

  Fewer Muslims on the victory podium indicates that the community's voting preference against BJP was offset by a bigger consolidation of Hindu castes in what is known as reverse polarisation.
  

  

  A key objective of
  SP's decision to ally with Congress+
  was to consolidate the Muslim votes. The fear was that the Muslim votes would split between SP and BSP, and help BJP sneak through.
  

  

  The campaign was not bereft of BJP's usual tactics to appeal to communal sentiments. PM Modi stirred things up with his and `Ramzan vs Diwali' comments, implying unfair treatment to Hindus by SP.
  

  

  The perception that Muslims vote en bloc, and tactically, is one that BJP seems to have used to its advantage, though the jury is out on whether the landslide is due to fatigue with regional parties or an expression of Hindu polarisation."

Many of them blamed it on ""conscious efforts"" by political parties to divide the minority votes. ""People who set up one community against the other are now in power. They made their intentions quite clear by fielding all the riot-accused candidates and reaped rich dividends of it,"" said Mohammad Shamshad, who had to leave his village Kutba during the riots.

Suresh Kumar Rana of BJP from Thana Bhawan, Nahid Hasan of SP from Kairana, BJP's Umesh Malik from Budhana and Vikram Singh from Khatauli - all have rioting and criminal intimidation cases filed against them.
  

  

  In the 2012 assembly polls, BSP had claimed three seats in Muzaffarnagar while BJP, SP and RLD had won one each. In Shamli, Congress, BJP and SP had won a seat each.

  ""The result is out and there is little we can do.

All we can hope now is that no riots are engineered by them to stay in power and peaceful conditions prevail,"" said a riot victim in Palda village, who did not wish to be named.
  

  

  TOI had earlier reported that at least 35% of the total voters who got displaced after the riots here in 2013 were not registered with the Election Commission. A survey conducted by Afkar India Foundation, an NGO working for the riot victims, revealed that out of 19,000 displaced voters here, 6,650 didn't have voter ID cards."
"BJP ex-state president Laxmikant Bajpai loses from Meerut City","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/bjp-ex-state-president-laxmikant-bajpai-loses-from-meerut-city/articleshow/57596934.cms","MEERUT: Laxmikant Bajpai, former state president of the BJP and four-time MLA from the Meerut City constituency, lost his seat despite the BJP's historic victory in the assembly elections. Bajpai was the BJP's state president when the party won an incredible 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, which delivered the decisive push needed to propel the party to a majority in the Lok Sabha. He preceded current state president Keshav Prasad Maurya. On Saturday, as results came in of a near repeat of the BJP's 2014 Lok Sabha performance, Bajpai was in for disappointment as he lost to SP's Rafiq Ansari by a margin of almost 29,000 votes. Meerut City constituency has a sizeable Muslim population, and as the BSP did not field a Muslim candidate, no vote split took place in the minority community.
  

  

  A political stalwart in the region, Bajpai first contested the Vidhan Sabha elections in 1989 from the constituency and defeated Mohammed Ayub Ansari by a margin of 15,000 votes. Since then, he has contested from this seat six times and won on four occasions, having suffered defeat in 1993 and 2007, to a Muslim candidate on each occasion. In the 2012 assembly elections, the SP, BSP and Congress had fielded Muslim candidates from the constituency, and Bajpai had managed to win by a margin of 6,000 votes. This time, however, the BSP did not field a Muslim candidate, and the only candidate from the community was the Congress-SP alliance's Ansari.

  ""The vote split did not happen this time, and that benefited the SP candidate. The entire Muslim population voted for him and Bajpai sahab suffered as a result. Owing to the huge Muslim population in this area, it is a difficult task for a BJP candidate to win,"" said a close aide of Bajpai.
  

  

  Bajpai himself was disappointed but said that the party's victory more than made up for his loss. ""The arithmetic of this seat is such that it was always going to be complicated once the BSP decided to field a non-Muslim. All Muslims have voted for the SP in this seat, there was no split. I accept the decision of the public. They have told me to go and do a refresher course as a party worker. That is their mandate and I respect that. I will continue to work for the party and the city. Overall, I am overjoyed with the performance of the party in the state. This has truly been a historic victory,"" said Bajpai."

Instead, her advised the party leadership to introspect on the debacle and prepare for the future.
  

  

  ""I do not agree to the charge that EVMs were tampered. I got 14,239 votes, and the numbers overall do not indicate tampering. This is our defeat and we should accept it and work to improve our performance in future,"" Gupta told TOI.

  On Bareilly Cantt seat, which the BJP's Rajesh Agarwal was defending, the main fight was between the BJP and SP-Congress alliance. While BJP fielded the veteran Agarwal, Congress had nominated Mujahid Hasan.
  

  

  Soon after the trends started to come out for the state, BSP supremo Mayawati held a press conference and alleged that the EVMs had been tampered, resulting in the BJP's overwhelming success. BSP, on the other hand, couldn't manage to win even a single seat from Bareilly district, while in 2012 the party had secured two seats here.

  BSP candidate Gupta came third as BJP and Congress candidates polled 88,441 and 75,777 votes respectively to get the first two positions. In the 2012 election, BJP's Agarwal had won with 51,893 votes.
  

  

  Taking a different line from his party leader, Gupta was introspective and urged the leadership to be realistic. ""In every election only one party or candidate wins while others are defeated. I think we should respect the people's mandate and work hard for the next election. In Cantt constituency, our party's voter base is very small. Despite this, I managed to get more than 14,000 votes. The Congress candidate got over 75,000 votes, around 25,000 more than the figure on which BJP had won in 2012. So it would be wrong to say that Muslims voted for BJP or there was tampering of the EVMs or any other such theory. I personally feel that we should refrain from making such allegations."""

  Assembly speaker Mata Prasad Pandey, who was SP candidate from Itwa too lost the elections from the assembly seat in Sidhartnagar district. He was defeated by the BJP candidate Satish Chandra Dwivedi.
  

  

  An SP candidate from Amethi, Prajapati had made headlines during the elections after an FIR was lodged on the directions of the Supreme Court accusing him and his aides of gang rape and sexual assault of a minor. Prajapati, who went underground a few days after polling in Amethi, was identified as an epitome of lawlessness by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah in most of their election speeches thereafter. Prajapati, however, remains on the run till date. Earlier, Prajapati hit the headlines after the Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe into illegal mining in the state when he was the minister for miming.
  

  

  Prominent among the 32 ministers who lost include minister for home guards Awdhesh Prasad (Milkipur), minister for khadi and cottage industry Bhramhashanker Tripathi (Kushinagar) who stood third, labor and employment minister Shahid Manzoor (Kithor), rural development minister Arvind Singh Gope (Ramnagar), food and civil supplies minister Kamal Akhtar (Hasanpur), animal husbandry minister Ziauddin Rizvi (Sikandarpur), controversial minister for transport Gayatri Prajapati (Amethi), Medical health minister Shivakant Ojha (Raniganj), minister for fisheries Riyaz Ahmed (Pilibhit), social welfare minister Shankhlal Manji (Jalalpur), minister for family welfare Ravidas Mehrotra (Lucknow central) along with a close Akhilesh aide and minister for Skill Development Abhishek Misra (Lucknow North).
  

  

  While a majority of the ministers lost their seat, some even survived the clean sweep by BJP and these include minister for parliamentary affairs Azam Khan (Rampur), panchayati raj minister Ram Govind Chaudhary (Bansdeeh), minister for food and drug administration Iqbal Mehmood (Sambhal), textile minister Mehboob Ali (Amroha), forest minister Durga Prasad Yadav (Azamgarh), IT minister Manoj Kumar Pandey (Unchahar), minister for stamps and registration Yasar Shah (Matera) and education minister Balram Yadav (Attrauliya)."

The region identified as the pocket borough of SP, stood by Mulayam, braving the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and secured four of the total five seats that SP won. But the 2017 assembly polls have thrown up a totally different picture with SP losing nine of the total of 14 assembly seats in the four districts it had swept in 2012 assembly elections.
  

  

  Apart from Shivpal Yadav's Jaswantnagar assembly seat which covers the Yadav clan's native village of Saifai, the SP managed to retain only Kannauj (central), Mainpuri (Sadar), Kisni and Karhal. Despite being a predominantly Yadav belt, rest of the seats went to BJP.
  

  

  Though senior SP leaders claim that a combination of a host of different factors have contributed to SP's route in its stronghold, they admit that the recent family feud in which party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his younger brother Shivpal Yadav were sidelined, had played an important role in the election results from the region. ""The manner in which Akhilesh had humiliated and dethroned his father (Mulayam) and uncle (Shivpal) left the elderlies upset to the extent that they did not vote for the SP,"" said a senior party leader, adding: ""In most of the places, they opted for the BJP.""
  

  

  The statement finds an echo in the election results as per which all nine seats SP lost went to the BJP. The BSP, which had earlier stood second in almost half a dozen seats during the 2012 elections, was pushed to the third place in all the constituencies except for Chhibramau in Kannauj where BSP's Tahir Siddiqui managed but only to retain his runners-up position of 2012."

  The party garnered 53.7% of total votes polled across all five assembly constituencies of Ghaziabad as compared to its state-wide average vote share of 39.7%.
  

  

  In all but one constituency of the district, that is, Loni, BJP's winning candidates have secured more than 50% of the votes polled. In Loni, Nand Kishor Gujjar of the BJP could secure only 41.2% of the total votes polled.
  

  

  The biggest victory margin was recorded by BJP candidate Sunil Sharma in the Sahibabad assembly seat, which is primarily urban and includes the trans-Hindon areas of Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Vaishali and Kaushambi.
  

  

  Sunil Sharma defeated his nearest rival, Amarpal Sharma of Congress, by a huge margin of over 1.50 lakh votes.
  

  

  On the other hand, BSP, which had won four out of the five assembly seats in Ghaziabad in the 2012 polls, has been completely wiped out. The BP  candidates just managed to secure second position in the assembly seats of Loni, Modinagar, Ghaziabad and Muradnagar. However, its vote share in the district dwindled to a mere 18.3%.
  

  

  The SP-Congress alliance, which went to the polls with two seats for the former and three for the latter, also drew a blank. The alliance has garnered a mere 19.81% of the total votes polled in the district. The ruling Samajwadi Party had fielded candidates in Loni and Modinagar who have garnered 74,754 votes in all, which is a mere 5.36% of the total votes polled.

  SP has attributed its loss to caste-based politics and a division in the Muslim vote bank. ""The BSP fielded Muslim candidates in Loni and Modinagar against the candidates of SP. This led to an erosion in the captive Muslim vote bank of the SP. Muslim votes got divided between the SP and the BSP which worked to the benefit of the BJP.

  The response came in response to a volley of questions in the context of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister's comments on Thursday. Congress refused to respond to a query if it was ready to suggest a 'grand alliance' with BSP supremo Mayawati as the chief minister.
  

  

  Earlier in the day, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi debunked exit polls predicting a win for BJP in UP. Talking to reporters in Parliament he said, ""Our alliance is winning. We saw such exit polls in Bihar too. We will talk tomorrow.""
  

  

  Akhilesh's comment extending a hand of friendship to arch rival BSP created a flutter as the two parties are seen as implacably opposed to each other to even think of a pact. Their irreconcilable differences and overlapping power ambitions blocked the formation of a Bihar-like pre-poll 'grand alliance', leading to SP tying up with Congress to make UP a three-cornered fight. But the re-entry of BJP as a strong player in state politics seems to have muddied the waters. It would be interesting to see how the regional rivals behave if BJP falls short of a majority and results throw up an equation where SP, BSP and Congress jointly possess the numbers to form the government.
  

  

  Many believe that Akhilesh's overture to BSP is rooted in the belief that Mayawati will finish a distant third in the state polls, which will soften the aggressive politician and force her to make a choice to back the SP leader for CM."
"Stable governments rare in UP: A state that has history of fractured verdicts","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/stable-governments-rare-in-up-state-that-has-history-of-fractured-verdicts/articleshow/57567230.cms","NEW DELHI: As far as electoral turmoil goes, Uttar Pradesh has seen it all. Splits, betrayal of alliances, mass defections, hung legislatures, President's rule, mid-term elections, and ruling parties flipping chief ministers.
  

  

  Since 2007, two successive governments completed their terms and so a sense of
  UP's frothy history+
  seems to have edged out of public memory. But this smooth stability was the exception rather than rule. So, it will not be surprising
  if this time around there is a fractured verdict+
  .
  

  

  Of the 16 assemblies elected since 1952, a single party got the majority of seats and ruled for the full term only seven times. On the remaining nine occasions, governments came and went in rapid succession, some lasting two to three years and others collapsing within days.
  

  

  UP was the first state in the country to get a non-Congress government. Back in 1967, Charan Singh and his socialist colleagues left the Congress, formed the Bharatiya Kranti Dal, and took over the reins of office. This was a big event then because the Congress had a near invincible hold over governance across the country . Rising food prices and droughts fuelled sharp political discontent and people's desire for change.
  

  

  As a result of the political instability, President's rule was imposed in UP 10 times, a record of sorts. The last time the state went under Central rule was in 2002.
  

  

  Another consequence of the instability was the need to seek fresh mandates through mid-term elections. This happened seven times in the past, the last time in 1998. A parsing of this topsy-turvy history shows that in the early years, UP , like most of the country , was captivated by the Congress, more so because some of its biggest political figures were from the state. After the 1967 upheaval, the Congress's invincibility came into question. Alternatives were searched for by the people.

  In the 1970s, despite the Emergency, Congress rule was fragmented repeatedly by a parade of CMs who got miffed and either quit or were axed.
  

  

  Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna quit during the Emergency, bringing President's rule, and after the Emergency was lifted, Bahuguna joined the Opposition. Earlier, Kamlapati Tripathi had to quit after a Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) revolt rocked the state. Then, in 1977, the Janata Party formed government.
  

  

  Although the Congress won again in 1980, and had luminaries like V P Singh and N D Tiwari as CMs, all that came to nought as a restless electorate refused to be pacified.The Janata Dal won in 1989.
  

  

  Then began a phase of deep turbulence, helped along by the Mandal effect and
  rise of caste based politics+
  which was a way of the deprived sections flexing their political muscle. This phase lasted till BSP won a majority in 2007."

On Saturday, the state gave the party yet another unprecedented win, with 324 seats along with its allies in the 403-strong Assembly, decimating the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party and breaking their cyclical rule in the state.
  

  

  The result not only surprised SP, BSP and the Congress, it left the state and political pundits stunned as there was no perceivable wave during the election to trigger the tsunami of votes. It also pointed at a silent anti-incumbency that all-pervasive in the state despite the outgoing Samajwadi Party's strong development pitch all along the campaign. Political observers say it could well be a vote for change to halt the alternative rule by the two regional parties.
  

  

  BJP's big win also underlined a new chapter in its style of politics, playing the caste card to break the stranglehold of the regional parties on various castes. From inducting Dalit leaders from BSP to choosing an MBC to lead the party just ahead of polls and strategic ticket distribution, it beat SP and BSP in its own game that held them in good stead for years.
  

  

  The vote share of these parties too got depleted, with SP's share dropping from 29% in 2012, when it formed a majority government, to 22%, and BSP's share dropping from 26 to 22.
  

  

  While the drop may not be very significant, political observers say what seems to have hurt the regional parties is the splitting of the Muslim vote, which forms a large chunk in UP, with about 20%. Observers say while the split in SP left Muslim voters perplexed - as most could not decide between the old and new order in the party now under Akhilesh Yadav - the vote also got divided between SP and BSP.
  

  

  If the Muslim vote got divided, a number of other factors pushed the surging voters to press the button with the lotus symbol - from polarization caused by strong speeches from BJP leaders to low intensity communal incidents to the demonetization drive having a positive impact especially in rural areas. NDA's partners in UP performed well too, with Apna dal sweeping nine out of 12 seats it fought on and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party winning four out of eight.
  

  

  While the stage for a win in the Assembly polls was set in 2014 when a resurgent BJP won a stupendous 71 out of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, it faced a semblance of a fight from former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, who, stung by a very poor showing by his party, adopted the development agenda with a gusto and embarked on a campaign with ""vikas"" as his pitch to counter PM Narendra Modi's development plank.
  

  

  But, it came after three years of his term as CM and turned out to be probably too little, too late. What compounded his problems was an ugly war within his family when he wrested control of the party from his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav, the men who built and nurtured the party for 25 years. It caused so much bad blood that Mulayam refused to campaign and had Shivpal sulking. The legal battle to control the party symbol of cycle also cost Akhilesh precious time.
  

  Buy car vaccum cleaner on Shopclues.comShopcluesKnow the first step of financial planningMAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  If this wasn't enough, his decision to join hands with the Congress despite Mulayam's displeasure, did not work out as the the grand old party's tally went down to 7 from its strength of 28 in 2012 and it was unable to transfer its votes to SP. The hope of getting voters to pitch for youth - as Akhilesh held a number of roadshows with Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi -- got dashed.
  

  

  Mayawati, whose party now stares at political oblivion after getting wiped out completely in 2014, may have barely held on to her Dalit vote - albeit with an overall drop of about 4% -- but her caste formula failed to work, with the famed Dalit-Muslim and Dalit-upper caste not working out.
  

  

  BJP played its cards well, changing its strategy at virtually every phase over the long-stretch of polling across the state to suit the mood of the times and the conditions in the region across such a big geographical stretch.
  

  

  National BJP chief Amit Shah, however, said after the results that it was a vote for development and people have shunned pariwarvad and politics of caste to root for vikas."

  Taking into account the bets placed in the satta markets, BJP pipped the SP-Congress alliance in UP after the first phase of polling. The alliance, however, appeared to be convincingly ahead on the day of the first phase.
  

  

  The underground betting market in Churu has predicted that BJP will win 190-193 seats in UP with SP-Congress finishing second with 125-128 and BSP a poor third with 6567. The Mumbai betting market has given 198-201 seats to BJP, 119-122 to SP-Congress and 62-64 to BSP. According to both Churu and Mumbai betting markets, in Punjab, AAP and Congress are likely to finish with 53-55 seats each while a virtual wipe-out for BJP-SAD may yield just 6-7 seats for the ruling combine.
  

  

  The fortunes appear to have swung in BJP's favour between the first and the fifth phases. In the Churu market, while the BJP, with 140-150 seats, was behind SP-Congress (170-178) on the day of first phase (February 11), its seats dramatically increased after the fifth phase on February 27.
  

  

  On March 2, just two days ahead of sixth phase of polling, the score in the betting market was: BJP 190-193 seats, SP-Congress 125-128 and BSP 65-67.

"RSS stalwarts devise backward formula for BJP’s forward march","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/rss-stalwarts-devise-backward-formula-for-bjps-forward-march/articleshow/57602779.cms","LUCKNOW: Credit for the BJP's big UP victory largely goes to late VHP trustee Moropant Pingle and former general secretary late Ashok Singhal. The formula of consolidating Other Backward Castes with Hindus that helped BJP ride the 'Ramwave' and form its first government with a majority in 1991 was originally conceived by Pingle and Singhal in the early 1980.
  

  

  Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh belongs to backward caste and in 1991, he led his Lodh community to vote for the party en masse and went on to become CM of Uttar Pradesh in 1991 after the party won 221 seats.
  

  

  On February 19, 1981, when 800 Dalits (300 families) were converted to Islam by Ishaatul Islam Sabha in a ceremony at Meenakshipuram village in Tamil Nadu, several NGOs, industrialists and Hindu society members held a meeting in order to stop such conversions. They realised that Dalits in the TN village were treated as untouchables and were not allowed access by upper castes to temples and wells.
  

  

  ""Moropant Pingle and Ashok Singhal decided to hold a Virat Hindu Sammelan,"" recalled Prabhat Kumar Awasthi, who was then the all-India treasurer of Vivekanand Shila Smarak. Awasthi had surveyed all the villages where religious conversion took place.
  

  

  Senior Congress leader Dr Karan Singh was first president of Virat Hindu Sammelan, formed to bring Hindus across all castes under one umbrella. ""This was followed by Ekatamata Yatra in 1983. The first of the yatras was taken out from Haridwar till Ganga Sagar in West Bengal,"" said Awasthi, adding that all yatras assembled at Ram Tek in Maharashtra, which also became the focal point of the Ram temple movement.
  

  Earn more, save more with the Super Savings A/cFundsIndiaDelicious Way Of Dropping 8 Kilos In 14 DaysSunita's BlogRecommended By Colombia

  The ekatamata yatras received a grand welcome in backward and Dalit dominated regions. Due to his excellent organisational skills, Moropant was given the responsibility of planning, co-ordinating and executing the yatra, for which he traveled extensively across the country. His effective selection of routes to be taken by the Ekatmata Raths (chariots), magnified the impact of the yatra.
  

  

  It was followed by the 'Ram-Janki' Rath Yatra in 1984 and was a precursor to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The aim was to reunite Hindus and kindle community pride. Seven yatras traveled through Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where Rama was shown behind bars depicting his state inside the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Moropant was appointed convener and controller of this yatra. In 1986, a Faizabad court ordered unlocking of the temple.
  

  

  Since then, the Hindu Virat Sammelans became a regular feature of the RSS and its off-shoots. Before Kalyan Singh, LK Advani used the formula by launching a rath yatra that led to the rise of the BJP from two MPs in the Lok Sabha to 88 MPs.
  

  

  After Advani, Kalyan was the first to implement the formula successfully. It was, however, abandoned for the past 15 years before Amit Shah and Narendra Modi met Kalyan Singh and took tips on the formula before implementing it in the Lok Sabha election 2014 and then again in the Vidhan Sabha election 2017."

Policemen deployed there were quick to conclude the changing times. ""Parivartan ki bela hai..."" remarked one of them.
  

  

  The fragrance of insense sticks and 'havan samagri' drew the nose and took it to a small Hanuman Temple, about 50 metres away from the SP office. A party worker was quietly submitting 'ahutis' into the fire amidst the echo of Sundar Kaand (a religious chapter on the deity) paath. Photographs of Akhilesh Bhaiya and Dimple Bhabhi were placed before the deity to invoke his blessings. ""I am praying for our party's victory,"" said the devotee Ram Avtaar Yadav, a native of Azamgarh.
  

  

  Asked if he had seen the trends indicating BJP's landslide victory in UP, he said, ""Yes I have, but they are trends. I will not lose hope till the results are declared."" By 1 pm, trends grew stronger and SP's nosedive became a fact which disheartened a handful of supporters who were hoping against hope. In the evening, CM Akhilesh Yadav invited reporters to his official residence 5 Kalidas Marg for one last time.
  

  

  As Akhilesh told the media that he had accepted the verdict, a pall of gloom descended on the party office. An hour later, drizzle made a few pedestrians find shade near the office. One of them Mohan Kumar remarked, ""Indra dev bhi khush hain kamal ke khilne se. (Even the rain god is happy with the blooming of lotus)."""

  The BJP's rivals — the SP, the BSP and the Congress — have all seen their vote shares decline sharply since the 2012 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh though there is surprisingly not much change in their vote share when compared to the Lok Sabha elections of 2014.

  While the BJP has emerged victorious in UP after 14 years, the rivals appeared to have failed in converting their vote shares into an equivalent seat share.
  

  

  The BJP has managed to do even better in the neighbouring Uttarakhand winning over 46 per cent vote share. This, however, is down from the nearly 56 per cent the party polled in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.
  

  

  In Punjab, where the Congress has won a majority, the BJP saw its vote share decline to just about 5 per cent, down from nearly 9 per cent in the 2014 elections.
  

  

  The party also saw its vote share drop in Goa to nearly 33 per cent from over 54 per cent though it saw a big jump in Manipur to close to 35 per cent from 12 per cent."

  Most of the shopkeepers said that there has been a rise of up to 40 per cent in the sales as many supporters are buying Holi 'pichkaris', colours and merchandise plastered with the images of different political parties, a survey by ASSOCHAM Social Development Foundation noted.
  

  

  ""Though Holi festival has been used by political parties across most parts of India to connect with the masses and bond with voters, election season has certainly made it lucrative for colour manufacturers in and around UP where this festival is celebrated the most,"" said D S Rawat, national secretary general of ASSOCHAM while releasing the findings of survey.
  

  

  Many shopkeepers said they have come up with innovative water guns, colour sprays and balloons with stickers or prints of various political parties and most of the stuff has been sold as cadres contact them with bulk orders.

  ""There is an element of excitement owing to poll season as results would come near the Holi (on Monday),"" the survey said. The results of the five state assembly elections 2017 will be out on Saturday.
  

  

  The survey was conducted to ascertain the impact of elections on sale of Holi merchandise in UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab and other states.
  

  

  During the past one month, ASSOCHAM representatives interacted with about 100 manufacturers/ suppliers/ traders of Holi colours, water-guns, t-shirts and other such items in Allahabad, Hathras, Kanpur, Lucknow, Mathura, Meerut, and Varanasi that are known world over for their Holi festivities.

  Dismissing reports that the SP-Congress alliance had failed to work, he said the two parties got 29% votes and its core voters stayed with them. ""I'm happy about the alliance with the Congress and I believe the alliance will continue in future,"" Akhilesh told reporters at the CM official residence here.
  

  

  Later, he went to governor Ram Naik to tender his resignation. The governor asked him to continue as CM till the formation of the new government.

  When asked if the BJP had punctured the SP's cycle (election symbol), Akhilesh said: ""I've always maintained that our cycle has tubeless tyres. It is just that we just couldn't fill it with enough air. But it will not stop.""
  

  

  ""I think the new government will work better than the SP. The farmers' loans will be waived off in the first cabinet meeting and the government will built better roads,"" Akhilesh said, adding: ""Now I'm hoping the BJP waives debts of farmers across India.""
  

  

  Akhilesh said people probably did not like the Expressway that the SP government built, and instead they voted for a bullet train. The Agra Expressway was showcased during the SP's poll campaign.
  

  

  Referring to Mayawati's allegation that EVMs were tampered with, Akhilesh said the issue should be looked into since the charges were levelled by a political party. ""We will seek a report from the booths and then take a call,"" he said. The SP chief thanked people for giving him a chance to serve for five years."

  These elections are widely being seen as a virtual referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation decision and they would also be a test for Yadav who recently took charge as the national president of the Samajwadi Party.
  

  

  The elections will decide the fate of Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party which had failed to open its account in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
  

  

  Since Akhilesh took over the reins of the SP in January, this is the first assembly election where he is calling all the shots ranging from choice of candidates to deciding the party's poll strategy.
  

  

  He had met with stiff opposition from different quarters of the party but he stuck to his stand. The result of the elections would prove his leadership abilities, decision- making skills and political acumen.
  

  

  He forged a pre-poll alliance with the Congress whose success or failure may establish or destablise him depending upon the poll outcome.
  

  

  The BJP, which has been out of power in UP for 14 years, is anxiously waiting for the 'lotus' to bloom in the politically crucial state.
  

  

  In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP and its ally, Apna Dal, swept the polls bagging 73 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, riding the Modi wave.
  

  

  The popularity of the BSP would also be put to test this time.

  In the last two assembly elections, the voters of the state had given clear mandates. In 2012, the SP won 224 seats followed by the BSP (80) and the BJP (47).
  

  

  The Congress and the RLD, which had contested the Assembly elections together, bagged 28 and 9 seats respectively.
  

  

  In 2007, the BSP had emerged as the largest party with 206 seats followed by the SP which won 97 seats. The BJP had won 51 seats, while the RLD bagged 10 seats.
  

  

  In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the RLD could not win a single seat. Ajit Singh lost to BJP's Satypal Singh in his bastion of Baghpat, while his son Jayant Chaudhary also lost in Mathura to BJP's Hema Malini."

  The BSP chief challenged BJP president Amit Shah asking him to conduct polls again, adding she will be proven correct.
  

  

  ""Most votes in the Muslim majority constituencies have gone to BJP, (that) makes it evident that voting machines were manipulated,"" she added.

"Lucknow rides high on BJP victory wave","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/city-rides-high-on-bjp-victory-wave/articleshow/57601903.cms","LUCKNOW: The city was agog with hectic activities as the counting got underway and trends started going in favour of the BJP. While Modi fans took to streets, cheering aloud his success march, elders remained glued to TVs, discussing factors which led to the landslide victory of the BJP after a gap of around 14 years and why Akhilesh could not win despite all the development works he kept counting on.
  

  

  Excitement was at its peak as passers-by stopped at Gomtinagar's 1090 and at GPO crossing to witness and analyse live results on LED screens. Commenting on Mayawati blaming EVM tampering for her party's poor showing at the hustings, Chander Singh, a passerby, said, ""When people lose, they start making silly excuses. Had it been so how Congress could have registered victory in Punjab and how even her party could win a few seats in UP? Actually, people were fed up with successive governments in UP for increasing crime rate and corruption. Hence, they have unanimously voted for the BJP.""
  

  

  While some people criticised Akhilesh for joining hands with the Congress, others termed the SP family feud as a reason for their defeat. Mukesh Verma, a contractor, said, ""While Akhilesh was not capable of checking corruption and crime, Mayawati wasted public funds in erecting memorials which are now only adding to city's temperature. We have voted BJP to power because Modi has a clean image and he speaks about development and promotes idea of 'sabka sath, sabka vikas.' Such is the confidence of people in the Modi-led Central government that they do not even mind non-declaration of a CM face for the state.""

  Expressing similar views, Atul Kapoor said that whoever would be the CM he or she would always follow Modi's instructions. This would help UP in registering a tremendous growth rate in no time. ""It's not the CM's face which matters, but the party's overall ideology,"" said another local Ram Naresh Yadav.
  

  

  Most of the city's 'mithai' and floral shops were flooded with orders from BJP supporters. Holi stalls, displaying 'Modi masks', attracted people and were sold like hot cakes. While BJP office saw people playing Holi with 'Kesariya' colour and flowers, other party offices wore a sullen look.
  

  

  Popular eating joints too saw Modi supporters holding discussions on how the PM succeeded in putting India on world map by receiving praises from heads of various nations. While a daily visitor at the famous 'Raja thandai' shop in Chowk, jokingly raised a demand for 12 glasses of 'thandai' in 'Modi's name', another fan said, ""The PM's 'notebandi' decision was the first step towards checking corruption and he got full success in keeping inflation under check. Besides, surgical strike after the Uri attack showed his decision-making powers. I am confident he would lead UP on the path of development.""
  

  

  Students and youths were also in an upbeat mood. Youngsters riding motorcycles raising slogans of 'Modi Modi' were a common scene on city roads. Office-goers were seen doing threadbare analysis of the poll verdict."

  ""I think the new government in power will work even better than the SP. It's possible people didn't like the great Expressway we built and they voted for a bullet train. We built great roads may be the people of UP were not happy with that and want even better roads? Maybe the BJP will build even better roads,"" Akhilesh said.
  

  

  ""We waived Rs 16,000 crores of farmers' debt. Now I'm hoping the BJP waives debts of farmers all across India,"" he said.
  

  

  The outgoing UP CM also said ""votes aren't won by explaining things to people, they are won only by threatening people"". He was insinuating the BJP threatened voters.
  

  

  Akhilesh didn't blame his party's alliance with the Congress.
  

  

  ""I'm happy about the alliance with the Congress and I believe the alliance may remain in the times to come, as well, "" Akhilesh confirmed.

  About BSP leader Mayawati's allegation that ""electronic voting machines were tampered with"", Akhilesh said he ""will look into the issue"".

While she created history by defeating Samajwadi clan's choti bahu Aparna Yadav, she registered her victory with a significantly higher margin.
  

  

  Rita secured 95,402 out of 1,87,433 (over 50.8%) valid votes polled on the seat. Aparna bagged 61,606 votes while BSP's Yogesh Dixit who secured the third position got 26,036 votes.
  

  

  Talking to TOI she said, ""I was certain about my victory since the beginning but I wanted to outdo my previous performance. I am happy and thankful at the same time."" The margin of votes between Rita and Aparna was 33,798 votes. In 2012, Rita contested from the same seat on Congress party ticket and secured 63,052 of 1,61,890 valid votes to defeat BJP's Suresh Tewari with a margin of 21,753 votes.
  

  

  Rita left her home at 5.30 am and landed at the dakshineshwar hanuman temple in Hazratganj. It is customary among locals to seek the deity's blessings especially if there is something important related to their job or profession. ""I have been going to this temple for the past 40 years and I start all my important work by invoking the deity here,"" she said.
  

  

  Rita reached the Ramabai rally maidan, where counting was to take place, at around 6.30 am. Briefing her counting agents, she sat on one side till counting began. Trend updates had been favouring her since the first round. By noon, Rita's victory was clear and her win was formally stamped by formal declaration of results at 3 pm. Aparna, on the other hand retired into silence, after declaration of results.

  Rita and her supporters started for the party office in Hazratganj thereafter. The sitting MLA was given welcome at different places. At the party office, she met state president Keshaw Maurya besides other leaders. Her victory procession resumed from BJP office and ended at her residence in Dilkusha Colony where her daughter-in-law welcomed her with an aarti.
  

  

  Poll analysts claimed that Rita was able to secure her primary vote and her decision to quit Congress and join BJP favoured her. ""Rita benefited from the switch and added a bounty of 32,350 votes to her 2012 votebank,"" said JP Shukla, a veteran politcial commentator.
  

  

  Rita belongs to the political lineage of Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna, Congress leader and former chief minister of UP. Her brother Vijay Bahuguna has been the CM of neighbouring Uttrakhand. A professor in medieval and modern history in Allahabad University, she has been the mayor of Allahabad between 1995 and 2000.
  

  

  She has been a Gandhis' loyalist from the time of Indira Gandhi to Sonia and Priyanka-Rahul. In 2012, she took the crown of thorns to save Rahul Gandhi from party's losses. In 2014 Lok Sabha elections, she contested on Congress ticket against BJP's Rajnath Singh but lost. The loyal soldier rebelled when the party announced Sheila Dikshit as its chief ministerial candidate for 2017 Assembly elections."

  ""60.03 per cent votes were polled till 5 PM,"" Uttar Pradesh Chief Electoral Officer T Venkatesh said.
  

  

  The turnout for these seats was 57.92 per cent in the last Assembly polls in 2012.
  

  

  The average turnout in the seven phases of polling that began on February 11 has been around 60-61 per cent compared to 59.48 per cent in 2012.
  

  

  The poll percentage in the first phase was 64.22, in the second 65.16, third phase 61.16, fourth phase 60.37, fifth phase 57.37 and sixth phase 57.03.

  Voting concluded at 5 PM in all constituencies, barring the Naxal-hit areas where it ended at 4 PM.
  

  

  In Jaunpur, BJP candidate from Jafarabad seat Harendra Pratap Singh and four others were arrested for allegedly taking voters to polling booths in two vehicles.
  

  

  Singh, however, denied the charge.
  

  

  The counting of votes in UP will be taken up on March 11, along with four other states -- Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur, where Assembly polls were held.

  The BSP fielded its nominees for all seats.
  

  

  While the SP contested 31 seats, its ally the Congress is in the race for the remaining seats.
  

  

  In the 2012 polls, out of these 40 seats, 23 went to the SP, 5 to the BSP, 4 to the BJP, 3 to the Congress and 5 to others.
  

  

  In all, 535 candidates, including BSP (40), BJP (32), SP (31), Congress (9), RLD 21, and NCP (5) were in the fray.

  ""Both Modi and Kejriwal engage in politics of false promises,"" Gandhi said as he listed poll promises Modi and Kejriwal had made ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha and 2015 Delhi assembly polls respectively.
  

  

  He said the Congress governments echo voice of every countryman.
  

  

  Gandhi also attacked Modi over the recent killings of Indians in the US.

  Around 1.41 crore voters are eligible to take part in the balloting in the sprawling region that includes Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha constituency.
  

  

  The other districts which will see voting are Sonebhadra, Chandauli, Mirzapur, Ghazipur, Bhadohi and Jaunpur.
  

  

  While the onus is on the ruling Samajwadi Party to retain the 24 of the 40 seats it won in 2012, a lot is also at stake for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Modi himself as the party swept the Poorvanchal in the 2014 Lok Sabha battle.
  

  

  The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), trying hard to regain power in the country's most populous state, has put in all its might to add to its 2012 tally of five seats.
  

  

  The Congress, now a Samajwadi ally, won three seats in 2012, the Quami Ekta Dal one and three independents too made it to the outgoing assembly.
  

  

  In Poorvanchal, poverty is a dominant theme. In his speeches, Modi spoke a lot on joblessness and poverty.
  

  

  The BJP did not win even a single seat in five of the districts in 2012.
  

  

  The last phase of election is a litmus test for BJP stalwarts.
  

  

  Former Chief Minister and now Home Minister Rajnath Singh comes from Chandauli. Mahendranath Pandey, an MP, is a member in the Modi government. Ghazipur MP Manoj Sinha is Minister of State for Railways.
  

  

  Apna Dal leader Anupriya Patel, a BJP ally, has a lot at stake too. Her parliamentary constituency Mirzapur goes to polls on Wednesday.
  

  

  BJP leader Vijay Bahadur Pathak says the party was confident of doing ""exceedingly well"" in Poorvanchal.
  

  

  ""We have performed beyond our expectations in the last six phases. We are sure of getting maximum seats in the final phase,"" Pathak told IANS.
  

  

  The Samajwadi Party expelled most of its powerful Poorvanchal leaders after an internal party feud involving Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his estranged uncle Shivpal Singh.
  

  

  Senior cabinet minister and Akhilesh Yadav aide Rajendra Chowdhary says the region has always stood by the Samajwadi Party.
  

  

  The BSP is banking heavily on the appeal of Mukhtar Ansari and his family. The region is home to hundreds of thousands of weavers, many of whom are Muslims.
  

  

  BSP chief Mayawati speaks of a groundswell in her party's favour.
  

  

  ""People have tried and tested both Modi and Akhilesh Yadav and there is nothing but disappointment. Poorvanchal, like other parts of the state, is looking to the BSP for good governance,"" the Dalit leader says.
  

  

  Some areas are home to Maoists while some of the candidates have a criminal background. Security has been stepped in Sonebhadra, Mirzapur and Chandauli.

  It is a triangular fight in Mughalsarai, Sakaldeha, Sayyedraza and Chakia seats in Chandauli. So is the case in Mirzapur, Chunar, Majhwa, Chanbe and Madihan in Mirzapur district.
  

  

  Sonebhadra - Robertsganj, Ghorawal and Duddhi - will see a close contest between the BJP and BSP.
  

  

  Political strongmen who are either in the fray or have fielded family members include Sigbatullah, Vineet Singh and Atul Rai (BSP), Dhananjay Singh (Independent), Alka Rai and Sushil Singh (BJP), Dinesh Kant (RLD) and Manoj Kumar (Samajwadi Party).
  

  

  Varanasi has hogged the maximum limelight.
  

  

  It has eight assembly constituencies of which the BJP won three. In all 127 candidates are in the fray in Varanasi. Modi, Akhilesh Yadav, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati extensively campaigned in the city."

  ""I had never thought that Akhilesh would part ways with Netaji (as Mulayam is fondly known among supporters) and that too when Netaji is still alive,"" she told reporters.
  

  

  ""I don't know how could Akhilesh do this but he definitely loves his father. I think he has been misguided,"" said Sadhna who has been blamed for the feud in the family.
  

  

  Sadhna, who is believed to be close to Shivpal Singh Yadav, said that the younger brother of Mulayam has been insulted.
  

  

  ""Shivpal has been insulted. He was not at fault,"" she said.
  

  

  To a question on whether the family feud and the emergence of two factions in the party would mar its prospects in the ongoing Assembly elections, Sadhna said, ""It will have an impact on the outcome of the polls as its timing was wrong.""
  

  

  To a question, she said she wanted Samajwadi Party to return to power and Akhilesh back as the chief minister. ""Let's see what happens on March 11 and what the voters decide,"" she said.
  

  

  The step mother of Akhilesh also said she had been advising Mulayam on various issues ranging from social life, politics and even those related to family.
  

  

  ""I have kept the family united,"" she said.
  

  

  Maintaining that she had no interest in joining politics, Sadhana said that she wanted her son Prateek become a Rajya Sabha MP.
  

  

  ""Prateek would understand the gravity of the situation and he would definitely join politics,"" she said.

  On being blamed for the infighting, Sadhna held time responsible for the rough patch through which the family went, saying, ""I have given my 100 per cent to the family. I have given time to all members of the family, be it Ramgopal Yadav, his children, Dharmendra, the daughters-in-law of the family, my sisters-in-law or brothers of Netaji.""
  

  

  ""I have regarded everyone as part of my family and asked Netaji to help each one of them,"" she remarked.
  

  

  When asked why she did not take any credit for all the work she had done, she said, ""I never wanted to take any credit as whatever I have done is because of Netaji, and it is because of him that I have been able to do so much. Hence, I want to give all credit to Netaji.""
  

  

  She also said she now wants to foray into social work and help under-privileged people."

She was among the early voters in the last phase of assembly polls on Wednesday.
  

  

  Like Shanti there were seveal others in Jayapur, the first village adopted by the Prime Minister Naredra Modi in his parliamentary constituency, for whom voting comes first before doing daily chores. PM had adopted Jayapur in November 2014 under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana in Sevapuri assembly constituency, which was represented by SP MLA and minister of state for PWD and irrigation Surendra Patel.
  

  

  ""It is our duty to cast our votes to form a government,"" said Shanti, an illiterate but well versed to understand the importance of polling. Not only Shanti but many other women mostly housewives stood in the queues at the polling booths before preparing meal for the family. ""Cooking food is our daily routine, but election come once after five years. Abhi vapas jakar khana bana lenge"" (We will cook food after returning home), said Sunita Devi, who along with a group of women was returning from the polling booth after casting her vote. Many of them are beneficiaries of LPG connection under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. ""It takes no time to cook food,"" said Shweta Devi. Other women including Kamla Devi, Sangeeta, Arati Devi, Shanti Devi and Rajmani were also of the similar view. A 73-year-old Rajkumari Devi was also among the early birds.
  

  

  Men and women started gathering at the polling booths at Primary School, Jayapur before the beginning of polling, and around 35% votes were polled by 12. Jayapur village has 2,419 voters. The village head Narayan Patel said that the polling trend was satisfactory.
  

  

  More or less same trend was witnessed in Nageypur, another village adopted by the PM in 2016. There are 1540 voters in the village, and around 40% votes were polled by 1pm. Wifi enabled Nageypur also has Jayapur like features including solar power connection, 'Nand Ghar' (modern Aanganwadi) and vocational training centre for women and farmers. Most villagers feel proud of being the natives of PM's adopted village. The village head Paras Nath Rajbhar said that solar energy is being supplied to 25 houses out of 525. This village is also the part of Sevapuri assembly constituency. The neighbouring Mehdiganj village, which has 7,000 voters, also witnessed large turn out of voters.
  

  

  The Patel dominated Sevapuri constituency witnessed a triangular fight of incumbent Surendra Patel of SP, Mahendra Kumar Pandey of BSP and Neelratan Singh Patel Neelu of AD(S), the ally of BJP. There are 3.18 lakh voters in Sevapuri constituency. Other prominent castes in this constituency are Brahmin, Sc, Bhumihar, Bania, and Thakur."

Her strong Bhojpuri dialect, however, is better deciphered by Jamil Alam, her grandson.
  

  

  Around 1pm on Wednesday, Rasoolan stepped out of her house to vote at Dhampur government school which has been named after her husband. While Tarn Taran, the Punjab district where her husband made the supreme sacrifice at the age of 32, destroying Pakistani tanks in the 1965 war has progressed to address urban issues, back in Hamid's hometown basic civic facilities are missing.
  

  

  ""A lot of funds have been approved to develop our village. But local leaders are totally incompetent. People from a lot of developed countries have spent time in our house to understand how Veer Abdul Hamid managed to destroy Patton tanks. Union ministry (present and prevous) have also facilitated us a lot of times. But we have to struggle to get basic amenities in this ancestral village,"" said Rasoolan as she crosses the 'khadanja' (brick road) covered with sewage water as there is no drainage system.

  Her village Dullahpur had been adopted by Union minister of railways (state) and Ghazipur MP Manoj Sinha under Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana. The family's complaints are ordinary but relevant. ""74 solar lights were approved for our village but a survey of the area will show that less than 20 lights. Remaining have been installed in schools, colleges and homes of local politicians regardless of their affiliations (Congress, BJP, SP or BSP),"" shared Jamil (28), who works at Varansasi railway station as travel ticket examiner.
  

  

  The family speaks highly about Shivpal Yadav, the SP leader who approved a Rs 65 lakh hospital project and improved condition of roads. ""But that happened with personal intervention and not due to efforts of the sitting SP MLA,"" added Jamil.
  

  

  There are a lot of complaints about Subba Ram, the SP MLA elected in 2012 and this time Akhilesh Yadav gave ticket to Gareeb. BSP's Sanjiv Kumar and BJP supported candidate Triveni Ram (SBSP candidate) are fighting it out in Jakhania, a declared seat.
  

  

  Rasoolan said, ""Four SP MLAs represented Ghazipur as ministers in Vidhan Sabha (Kailash Yadav, Om Prakash Singh, Shadab Fatima and Vijay Mishra). The district has seven seats out of which six were won by SP."" A lot of people are angry with the way Ghazipur had been neglected in the past five years."

She was among the early voters in the last phase of assembly polls on Wednesday.
  

  

  Like her, there were several others in Jayapur, the first village adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his parliamentary constituency, for whom voting comes first before doing daily chores.
  

  

  For Shanti, it is a duty to cast vote to form government. Many other women, mostly homemakers, stood in queues at the polling booths before preparing meals for the family. ""Cooking food is our daily routine but election comes once after five years. Abhi vapas jakar khana bana lenge (We will cook food after returning home),"" said Sunita Devi, who was returning home with a group of women after from the polling booth after casting her vote.
  

  

  Many of them are beneficiaries of LPG connection under Ujjwala Yojana. It takes no time to cook food, said Shweta Devi. Kamla Devi, Sangeeta, Arti Devi, Shanti Devi and Rajmani were spoke in the same vein. A 73-year-old Rajkumari Devi was also among early birds.
  

  

  Men and women started gathering at the polling booths at Primary School, Jayapur before the beginning of polling. Around 35% votes were polled by 12 noon. Jayapur village has 2,419 voters. The village head Narayan Patel said that the polling trend was satisfactory.
  

  

  More or less same trend was witnessed in Nageypur, another village adopted by the PM in 2016. There are 1,540 voters in the village and around 40% votes were polled by 1pm. WiFi enabled Nageypur also has facilities such as solar power connection, Nand Ghar (modern Aanganwadi) and vocational training centre for women and farmers.
  

  

  Most villagers feel proud of being the natives of PM's adopted village. Village head Paras Nath Rajbhar said that solar energy is being supplied to 25 houses out of 525. This village is also the part of Sevapuri assembly constituency. The neighbouring Mehdiganj village, which has 7,000 voters, also witnessed large turnout.
  

  

  The Patel-dominated Sevapuri constituency is locked in a triangular contest involving Surendra Patel of SP, Mahendra Kumar Pandey of BSP and Neelratan Singh Patel Neelu of AD(S), the ally of BJP. There are 3.18 lakh voters in Sevapuri constituency. Other prominent castes in this constituency are Brahmins, SCs, Bhumihar, Bania and Thakur."

  Ramgarh Tal is a favourite spot for romantic and action scenes of several Bhojpuri films. Kailash's excitement is palpable as he participates in a roadshow led by the film's hero, Tiwari, now BJP's star campaigner.
  

  

  Some 150km away from Kailash, Gautam Dubey and Bhairon Kesri are engaged in Bhojpuri banter outside Sajan Cinema for a `Mehndi Lagake Rakhna' show in Var anasi. ""Ka raja...vote keke deba (So, dude, who will you vote for),"" asks Dubey , prompting a quick reply from Kesri, ""Kahe tohke batayein..(why should I tell you?).""
  

  

  Between them, at least a few thousand Bhojpuri patrons have queued up outside the poster on a wall of the theatre that shows actor Kajal ca noodling hero Khesari Yadav.
  

  

  Such is the Bhojpuri fascination and conscious effort to use it in banter in Purvanchal districts that even PM Narendra Modi used a specific Bhojpuri word `Ghelua' (extra) in his town hall address to intelligentsia at Diesel Locomotive Workshop on Sunday evening. `Ghelua' means extra and Modi used it to seek support for ally partner Apna Dal which dominates Purvanchal districts, which were to vote in the sixth and seventh phases.

  There are three kinds of Bhojpuri dialects--Kashika, Bihari and Khaati. In Azamgarh, Samajwadi Party MP from Kannauj and wife of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Dimple, who has been campaigning extensively , had used Khaati dialect of Bhojpuri, with a tinge of Urdu. This one uses `e' as phonetics at the end of sentences. BJP might have done its homework on Purvanchal a wee-bit extra.
  

  

  It was visible in two dozen chopper jaunts for roadshows and rallies that both Manoj Tiwari and his Bhojpuri celluloid colleague Ravi Kissen made in Deoria, Gorakhpur, Mau and Kushinagar.
  

  

  Even RJD chief Lalu Yadav relied heavily on Bhojpuri one-liners to woo the voters in most of his rallies.

  The two assembly constituencies which have been reserved for STs this time are Obra and Duddhi.
  

  

  In the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly there are 317 general seats while 84 seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and two for Scheduled Tribes (ST).
  

  

  ""STs constitute almost 36 per cent of Duddhi's voters, while 18 per cent of the population of Obra assembly constituency is that of the STs,"" said Vijay Singh Gond, who has been MLA from Duddhi seven times on different party tickets.
  

  

  Gond (65), who is contesting this time on a BSP ticket, said that Duddhi is one of the biggest blocks in UP.
  

  

  ""It is because of this that we are demanding that Duddhi be made a separate district. The demand to make Duddhi a district has been going on since March 4, 1989, when Sonbhadra was carved out from Mirzapur, but in the last 5 years, the agitation has intensified,"" he said.
  

  

  He said that even during the British Rule, Duddhi was a separate administrative unit, and was governed by a different set of rules. ""It was not a part of any district at that time,"" he claimed.
  

  

  Prior to this election, Duddhi was reserved for Schedule Castes (till 2012), while Obra has been created after delimitation in 2008 and was a general seat in 2012 polls.
  

  

  Addressing an election rally here yesterday, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi promised that if Congress-SP alliance forms the government in the state, they would make Duddhi district headquarters.
  

  

  Gond's victory march started in 1980 on Congress ticket, and continued in 1985 as well. In 1989, he contested as an Independent while fought on Janata Dal ticket in 1991 and 1993, and emerged victorious. He retained the seat on SP ticket in 1996 and 2002.
  

  

  He did not contest in 2007, and Chandra Mani Prasad of BSP won the election, while in 2012 Independent candidate Ruby Prasad bagged Duddhi.
  

  

  Obra was won by BSP's Sunil Kumar in 2012.
  

  

  According to Ravindra Kesari, a resident of Sonbhadra, ""Gond's caste was listed in the ST category in 2005. Hence, he could not fight the subsequent elections. After the seat was notified as reserved for ST by the EC and following delimitation, Gond is again in fray.""
  

  

  Among other local issues, giving rights to use the forest products to the forest dwellers is the prominent one in the polls here.
  

  

  ""Demonetisation is also a major issue in this assembly election. Apart from this, health and education have always been election issues in the district for the past many years,"" Kesari said.
  

  

  Interestingly, Gond's son Virendra Pratap Singh is also contesting from the neighbouring Obra constituency on a BSP ticket.
  

  

  Some of the other candidates in fray from Obra include Ravi Gond of SP and Sanjiv Kumar of the BJP. There are as many as 11 candidates trying their luck from Obra constituency.
  

  

  Similarly in Duddhi, Vijay Singh Gond is challenged by Anil Kumar Singh of the Congress, Shivkumar Kharwar of RLD and Hariram of Apna Dal (Soneylal). The total number of candidates in fray from Duddhi is eight.
  

  

  Sonbhadra borders four states - Madhya Pradesh, Chhattishgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar.

  BJP will emerge the single largest player in Uttar Pradesh+
  , Samajwadi Party chief and CM Akhilesh Yadav said it was the moral responsibility of all secular forces to come together to stop the saffron outfit.
  

  

  ""In order to stop communal forces and in order to provide security and prosperity to all sections of society, all secular forces have a moral responsibility to come together to give the people of Uttar Pradesh a democratic government,"" Akhilesh told TOI just after exit polls suggested that he might not return to office.
  

  

  
  

  

  Akhilesh did not specifically mention BSP in his
  pitch for ""secular"" unity+
  . But with Congress already his partner, the call seemed to be clearly aimed at the Dalit outfit which has been at loggerheads with SP since the mid-1990s when their coalition came apart.
  

  

  Speaking separately to a news agency, the CM seemed keen to avoid the prospect of the state being put under a spell of central rule in case the outcome on Saturday threw up a hung House. He said no one would prefer President's rule in the state which would mean BJP would have a remote control in UP.
  

  

  His remarks came soon after most of the exit polls showed BJP in the lead.
  

  

  Earlier in the day, Akhilesh had expressed confidence that the SP-Congress alliance would get a clear majority and form the government, though he added that a clear picture would emerge only after the results were announced.
  

  

  BSP and SP have been at daggers drawn not only because of the antagonism among their core constituencies of Jatavs and Yadavs, but also because BSP chief Mayawati has not forgiven Samajwadis for the infamous guest house episode of June 1995. A mob of SP workers had assaulted her after BSP pulled out of the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led coalition. Mayawati remains convinced that Mulayam, who was still the CM, ensured that police did not come to her rescue.
  

  

  While
  Mulayam is no longer at the helm of SP+
  , tension between the two parties persists and and has found expression in the putdowns that Akhilesh and Mayawati directed at each other during the campaign. Still, observers feel the change of leadership might lead the two parties to review their equations now because of BJP regaining the prominence it enjoyed in the state in the 1990s.
  

  

  The two parties forged a partnership in 1993 and succeeded in preventing BJP from getting a majority in assembly polls held when Ram Janmabhoomi sentiments ran strong. They formed a coalition with Mulayam as the chief minister. However, the alliance did not last long and in 1995, Mayawati and her mentor Kanshi Ram withdrew BSP's support, pushing the Mulayam government into a minority."

She sent her deputy and party national general secretary Naseemuddin Siddiqui to offer 'chaadar' at Ajmer Sharif and pray for her party's success in the crucial assembly elections.
  

  

  BSP sources said Siddiqui and his son Afzal flew to Jaipur from where they would head to Ajmer on Wednesday when polling in 40 assembly constituencies of UP would be underway. A close associate of Siddiqui confirmed to TOI that the BSP leader will be offering a chaadar on the party's behalf. A host of other BSP cadre workers are also expected to attend the prayers. Mayawati sending her party leaders to offer prayers at the world famous dargah comes close on Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting temples before launching a roadshow in Varanasi.
  

  

  Mayawati is not known for her religious affiliations though she follows Buddhist practices. The elections year, however, saw the Dalit leader taking the religious routes off and on. She first got a special yatra organised for Hindu pilgrims during Kumbh and then another one for Ajmer Sharif last year. At the same time, she kept greeting people on all religious festivals, including Eid, Diwali and Christmas."

  Some analysts read that statement to mean the SP is considering an alliance with Mayawati's BSP.
  

  

  ""It is my belief that farmers, youths and women have voted in SP's favour. Once the results come out, the situation will be evident. I'm confident the SP-Congress alliance will win majority and form the government,"" Akhilesh Yadav told BBC Hindi today after exit polls released their projections.
  

  

  The exit polls pointed to a hung Assembly, albeit with big gains for the BJP.
  

  

  The SP president conceded the possibility of an unexpected reversal. Without mentioning the BSP or any other rival party by name, Akhilesh admitted that in order to form the government, he would not be averse to further alliances.
  

  

  ""If need be, no one wants president's rule in the state, or that the BJP should runs the state with a remote control,"" Akhilesh said.
  

  

  Clearing the air after the chief minister's remarks about the possibility of a post-poll alliance, SP leader Naresh Agrawal said the media shouldn't read too much into the statement.
  

  

  ""Akhilesh ji didn't mention BSP or Behenji's name; the aim is to keep communal forces out of the state,"" Agrawal told ANI.
  

  

  When Akhilesh was asked if he was anxious about March 11, the day votes will be counted, the UP chief minister explained that the SP government has clearly worked for the state and the people had voted on the basis of that.
  

  

  ""At a personal level, I'm looking forward to the results. It was a huge election, and the campaigning went well. All I can hope for now is a good result,"" he said with a smile.
  

  

  Exit polls predicted the BJP will emerge as the largest single party in Uttar Pradesh, winning anywhere between 164 and 210 of the 403 seats in the state assembly. The Congress-SP alliance is expected to land around 120 seats, down from the 252 seats the SP won in the 2012 elections."

  Before results are announced on Saturday, no one either from the SP or BSP has denied or opposed prospect of coming together and with Congress playing a catalytic role, a Grand Alliance in UP is possible. The only difference will be that this would be after the polls and against public mandate, while in Bihar, JD (U) and RLD who were rivals for a long time united to halt the saffron march and succeeded.
  

  

  SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, who shares cordial relations with BSP chief Mayawati and its general secretary Satish Chand Mishra might play mediator. He had once praised Mayawati as chief minister and told media that functioning of officers during Mayawati's regime was far better than during SP rule.
  

  

  The way Akhilesh Yadav total control of the party by dislodging his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and showing door to the ""liabilities"", he has been giving clear signal that he would chart a new course in the politics without carrying baggage of family or ""outsiders"".
  

  

  Hinting at joining hands with BSP is another step beyond the ideological framework of the Samajwadi Party drawn by Mulayam Singh Yadav. The two parties had come together in 1993 and contested elections jointly in the wake of Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In 1995 ,their alliance was broken as the political partnership materialised only at the top level and did not percolate to the social level as Backwards and the Dalits clashed with each other for power. Since then, the two parties have remained inimical to each other, carving out their own territory over the last 15 years rotating power between them.
  

  

  If Congress plays referee, and Grand Alliance is formed in Uttar Pradesh, it would be the beginning of the battle for 2019 parliament elections and raise a formidable political force against the BJP by uniting the OBCs, Dalits and the Muslims all over the country."

  Singh has been blamed by a section of the party leadership for creating fissures between Mulayam and Akhilesh."
"Yadav family feud is not over till results are declared","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/yadav-family-feud-is-not-over-till-results-are-declared/articleshow/57568908.cms","LUCKNOW: With polling for the seventh and last phase over and only three days left for the long awaited results of the Assembly elections, it would now be interesting to see who will be writing the final chapter of the raging family feud in the Yadav clan. Will it be Akhilesh Yadav, chief minister and president of the Samajwadi Party, who addressed 221 rallies across the state in the last 40 days, or his father and founder of SP, Mulayam Singh Yadav. Akhilesh may have upstaged his father to become party president and but he has learnt much from Mulayam Singh, which was evident from the way he mingled with the public. No other leader campaigned for Ambedkar Nagar seat which was countermanded following death of a BSP candidate, while Akhilesh campaigned in the region till Wednesday.
  

  

  On the other hand, Mulayam's second wife Sadhna Gupta speaking against Akhilesh Yadav on the eve of the last polling day while defending the stance of Shivpal Yadav proved that the fight over Mulayam's legacy that began on November 1 at the Janseshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow has not ended yet and would keep cropping every now and then.
  

  

  The ouster of Shivpal and Amar Singh by Akhilesh and later his victory in the battle for the party symbol cycle gave him confidence to handled all ticket distribution single-handedly, even at the cost of denying it to some winnable MLAs like Zeenat Khan in Patiyali in Kaasganj and Sadaf Fatima in Ghazipur.
  

  

  As Akhilesh and his wife Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav took control in place of Mulayam and Shivpal, the family feud raised its head in stray incidents as of Shivpal threatening that those who have harmed him will not be spared even as he appealed to Jaswantnagar voters to ensure his victory, it was clear that the feud was far from over.
  

  

  Shivpal Yadav was further angered when his cousin and Akhilesh's new guide and mentor Ram Gopal Yadav—also the party's Rajya Sabha member—and said ""party ka bachaa hua kooda bhi March 11 ko baahar kar diya jayega (remaining scrap of the party would be thrown out on March 11 after the results)"". Isolated and marginalised, Shivpal has remained tight- lipped. When the ToI contacted him, his reply was ""Wait for March 11. Kabhi kabhi samay bahut see cheezon ka jawab de deta hai (time has the answer to many posers)"".
  

  

  Sadhna Gupta, who has never spoken in public for over 25 years since she was married to Mulayam gave a new twist to the family saga when said that she and her son Prateek Yadav would also battle for Mulayam Singh Yadav's and said, ""Ab nahin chup rahoongi...bahut sah liya (I have tolerated enough. Will not remain quiet any more).
  

  

  The performance of the SP-Congress alliance anchored by Akhilesh Yadav without taking Mulayam Singh or any other party veteran into confidence would pose a challenge for Akhilesh Yadav and that would be his litmus test on dealing with the family feud. Obviously, if the alliance does well, Akhilesh Yadav would remain undisputed heir of Mulayam's legacy as he has now but if the alliance doesn't live up to the expectations, he could be facing another rebellion in the family, while those in the party who have been lying low all through the drama may raise questions over the decision to dislodge Mulayam Singh Yadav, taking total control of the party and joining hands with Congress besides the stance of denying tickets to Mulayam-Shivpal followers.
  

  

  Before the election process began, the dismissed state president of the party Shivpal Yadav had announced he would form his party after March 11. In any eventuality, it remains to be seen whether he does what he claimed or is shown the door from the party by the new party chief.
  

  

  Akhilesh has already weighed all his options and seems prepared. An electoral defeat or two in any political party is part of the game. What makes Akhilesh confident of no threat to his leadership is his direct contact even at the village level among party workers as well as public, who have accepted and welcomed him as the leader of the Samajwadi Party ."
"Triangular contest triggered voting surge in UP","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/triangular-contest-triggered-voting-surge-in-up/articleshow/57568943.cms","LUCKNOW: The triangular contest between the SP, BSP and the BJP seems to be the reason for the high voting percentage in UP assembly polls this time.
  

  

  After a gap of 14 years, the BJP has made inroads into the political arena, hitherto dominated by the SP and the BSP. The 2017 polls recorded highest-ever voting percentage of 61% in UP. This is almost 1.6% more than the 2012 assembly elections when the SP came to power with absolute majority. In the 2007 elections, the BSP came to power with absolute majority when only 46% polling was recorded.
  

  

  In 2007 and 2012, the anti-incumbency factor had played a key role in government formation. ""On the past two occasions, people voted to defeat the ruling dispensation. There were only two options. This time, people voted to ensure win of a party. This has resulted in high voting percentage,"" says JP Shukla, a political commentator.
  

  

  In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP managed to get nearly 42% vote share and won 324 assembly segments. Experts say the BJP is banking on consolidation of upper caste and non-Yadav OBC vote banks which together account for nearly 50% of the population.
  

  

  Similarly, the SP has played up its development agenda, trying to dissuade the anti-incumbency factor. Though hit by a prolonged bitter family feud last year, the SP relied on the consolidation of voters cutting across caste lines. In 2012, the SP won 220 seats with 29.1% vote share, a significant improvement as compared to 2007 polls when it had got 97 seats with 25.4% vote share. This time, it entered into an alliance with the Congress which won 22 and 28 seats with 8.6% and 11.6% vote share in 2007 and 2012 assembly elections, respectively.
  

  

  BSP chief Mayawati made an aggressive Muslim outreach in addition to her traditional core Dalit vote bank. Not just an anti-BJP move, Mayawati also worked on caste arithmetic in each assembly seat. Muslims traditionally vote en-bloc and might have contributed significantly to the higher turnout."

Well, the answer is a big 'Yes', if the exit poll predictions of pollster Today's Chanakya prove accurate.
  

  

  While most of the exit polls predicted a hung Assembly in Uttar Pradesh, Today's Chanakya projected a landslide for the BJP.
  

  

  Today's Chanakya, which made the most accurate predictions during the 2014 general elections, today projected that the BJP combine will win 285 seats in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.
  

  

  This prediction has an error margin of 18 seats which means the BJP tally could be in the range of 267 to 302 seats.
  

  

  The Congress will be restricted to 88 seats, while the BSP will manage only 27 seats, the Chanakya poll predicts.
  

  

  The Times Now-VMR poll forecast 190-210 seats for the BJP in the UP assembly, India News-MRC gave it 185 and ABP- Lokniti CSDS 164-176 seats."
"Dimple 'bhabhi' adds colour to SP campaign","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/dimple-bhabhi-adds-colour-to-sp-campaign/articleshow/57536507.cms","LUCKNOW: The reticent and soft-spoken 'bahu' of the first family of the ruling Samajwadi Party in UP, Dimple Yadav, has finally found her groove, emerging as a major crowd puller in election rallies all over the state.
  

  

  From the fumbling leader who repeatedly corrected herself while going through her written text in Parliament on Kaushal Vikas mission some months ago to proper utilisation of manpower, the 39-year-old Kannauj MP has come a long way.
  

  

  The new Dimple - the star campaigner - has learnt how to keep the audience especially the youth involved and impress them.
  

  

  Aptly donning the role of the 'bahu' and 'bhabhi', she has gone about endearingly reprimanding the young enthusiasts with warnings that she will complain about them to their 'bhaiya' (Akhilesh Yadav) and at the same time taking care of the elders among the electorate seeking 'muhdekhaiye' (gift) for her in terms of votes.
  

  

  When party workers went berserk in Allahabad, she said, ""I will tell bhaiya (Akhilesh) that you did not let me speak. I will complain...bhaiya is coming here tomorrow.""
  

  

  Addressing another election rally in Jaunpur, she won over the elders and young alike when she started her speech seeking 'muhdikhai' -- a ritual where family members give a gift to a bride when they see her face for the first time.
  

  

  ""...Main pehli baar poorvanchal aayee hoon...mujhe muh dikhai milegi...poora vishwas hai (I have come to Poorvanchal for the first time. I am confident I will get the gift of votes as muhdikhai),"" she said striking an instant chord with the people.
  

  

  In the face of dissent in the family which had left Chief Minister and party president Akhilesh Yadav almost alone to lead the campaign, he found sufficient support in his wife who took to electioneering on her own and with ease.
  

  

  The shy daughter-in-law of Mulayam Singh Yadav has not desisted from attacking even the high and mighty political opponents but with dignity and decorum in the times when electioneering touched a new low.
  

  

  ""Mere angney mein tumhara kya kaam hai?"" she questioned in a clear reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's adopted son remark.
  

  

  She was firm when she remarked in Bhadohi: ""I am the daughter of an armyman, these people are taking credit for the martyrdom of our soldiers...they are politicising the army... never seen such a government earlier.""
  

  

  She also paid back when she said, ""The Modi government which had promised 'achchy din' did the 'karnama' of note ban. ...you were made to run around for taking out your own money from banks...that was your hard earned money...till date there is no detail of how much black money has been detected.""
  

  

  In the over two dozen meetings that she addressed, Dimple's interaction with the surging crowds had been extempore and personal and the response was surprising.
  

  

  According to party insiders, Dimple's involvement in these elections had not just been confined to campaigning but she had also worked back channels on behalf of her husband.
  

  

  She is said to have met the Congress leadership, carrying message from Akhilesh, for finalising the SP-Congress alliance around which the party built up its election strategy.
  

  

  Shedding the tag of a reluctant politician, Dimple led a sustained attack on political opponents.
  

  

  Not only did her presence add colour to the SP's campaign, she also connected well with the youth and the women."

  ""I do not think about anything other than the Ganga,"" the Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation told reporters when asked whether she would become the chief minister if the BJP wins the UP polls.
  

  

  The BJP is the only major contender for power in Uttar Pradesh which has not declared a chief ministerial candidate.
  

  

  The SP-Congress alliance has incumbent Akhilesh Yadav as the chief ministerial candidate and the BSP has its supremo Mayawati.
  

  

  Expressing her desire to make the Ganga river clean in her lifetime, Bharti said, ""I will go to any extent to achieve this aim whether I die or have to fight with others.""
  

  

  She lashed out at opposition parties for raising questions over the work done so far to make the Ganga river clean, saying there will be ""perceptible results"" by 2018.
  

  

  ""The timeline given by me will be followed and results will be seen in 2018,"" she said.

  She also attacked Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for alleging that no work has been done for cleaning the Ganga.
  

  

  ""He should not lose patience. I will take him to the places where work is being done. Just tell Rahul not to go to Bangkok and stay in India,"" she said, in an apparent reference to his visits abroad.

  Buoyed by exit polls and in anticipation of victory, the Agra BJP has ordered 50 kg of kesariya colour and 100 kg gujia. The SP has too ordered rose flower petals along with laddoos for the celebrations. Four time BJP MLA from Agra, Jagan Prasad Garg, who is in fray this time too, has even sent out invites for Holi Milan Samaroh on Saturday evening.
  

  

  ""We will distribute Gujias to the public and our supporters as we are sure of victory"", said city BJP president, Vijay Shivhare. He said ""Modi jee's"" fame will surely ensure a victory for the BJP in the state. He said, ""we would celebrate Holi in Saturday only and distribute gujias and kesariya colour"".
  

  

  Another city leader said they had placed orders for the Gujias instead of laddoos due to Holi. ""Gujias are the flavour of this season"", he said.
  

  

  District president of Samajwadi party, Ram Sahai Yadav also expressed confidence of his party winning the polls and said they had ordered 6 quintals of rose petals and 6000 ladoos.
  

  

  BJP sitting MLA and candidate from Agra (North) Jagan Prasad Garg said he had already planned this ""holi milan samaroh"" a month ago. ""We know that BJP would form the government in the state and I would win too"", he said adding that it would be ""holi celebrations"" for all.
  

  

  The BSP which won six of the nine seats in the last polls, is keeping a low profile. A local leader said they would prefer to wait for the results rather than getting into a celebrations mode right now.
  

  

  The BJP had won two, and the Samajwadi Party (SP) got one seat in Agra in the last polls."

  The high turnout of voters in all eight assembly constituencies was evident since the beginning of polling at 7am. Till the end of polling at 5pm, the district recorded 61.32% polling but long queues remained at many booths inside polling stations. After polling ended at 6.30 pm, district election officer Yogeshwar Ram Mishra said the total percentage of polling was 63.64%. In the 2012 assembly elections, the district had registered 57.68% polling that rose to 58.31% in the 2014 elections.
  

  

  Polling percentage would have gone much higher had the names of thousands of voters--many were seen making a hue and cry at polling centres--not been deleted from electoral rolls. Mishra said complaints had come to his knowledge and he he had set up an inquiry into the matter of deletion of names from the voters' list. The accountability of booth-level officers would also be fixed, he said.
  

  

  The Election Commission had conducted exercises like cricket matches, street plays, rallies and awareness campaigns for more than a month to increase the polling percentage. Election officials said they were happy over the turnout.
  

  

  Rajendra Prasad Tirpathi of Chaubeypur feel that highvoltage campaign by Modi for three days, roadshow of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and rallies by BSP supremo Mayawati and other politicians also resulted in mobilizing the voters.
  

  

  Realising the ground realities, especially the resentment among a section of workers after denial of ticket to seven-time BJP MLA Shyamdeo Roy Chaudhary , dissatisfaction against fielding of Saurabh Srivastava at Cantonment seat, tough contest in Varanasi North seat due to SP-Congress alliance and division of Apna Dal and BJP brought 25 Unions ministers and dozens of star campaigners to the city.
  

  

  The SP-Congress alliance, BSP and smaller parties did not allow the BJP to steal the show. The city remained abuzz with mega political shows for more than a week after the end of the fifth phase of elections. People in villages and townships of Ajgara (SC), Pindra and Sewapuri assembly constituencies like Raunakala, Tarva and Murdaha said that shows of Modi, Akhilesh and Rahul left an impact on rural masses."

The previous high was in 2012 when 59.48% voting was recorded in the state. The seventh and the last phase covering 40 assembly seats in seven districts of eastern UP saw 60.03 % voting -- much higher than 57.92% and 55.36% recorded in 2012 assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections respectively.
  

  

  As per the Election Commission officials, the final tabulated polling percentage of the first six phases is 61.18%. Chief electoral officer T Venkatesh said with over 60% voting in the seventh phase, the overall polling percentage the state has already crossed 60% and may even touch 61% -- the highest ever in UP's electoral history.
  

  

  The high voting percentage came amid a keenly fought triangular contest between the SP-Congress alliance, BJP and the BSP. While SP-Congress smarted under almost no sign of anti-incumbency, the BJP made a high pitch election campaign led by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BSP chief Mayawati, too, has been pitching her party strongly in one of the most crucial elections that could determine her political fate. It saw Varanasi recording an impressive 61% turnout -- up from 58.3 in 2012.
  

  

  Another significant aspect of month-long voting is higher turnout of female voters. They contributed towards the high polling percentage. According to ECI records, till the sixth phase, 63.26% female voters exercised their franchise against 59.65% male voters. This was almost also 3% higher than in 2012 when 60.31% women cast their votes.
  

  

  Chandauli district recorded the highest poll percentage of 61.13% in the seventh phase. The Chakia reserved seat in Chandauli, in fact, recorded 61.72% voting, which was likely to go up further, the poll panel said. It was followed by the tribal dominated districts of Sonebhadra and Mirzapur where voting percentage touched a figure of 61% and 60.80%, respectively.
  

  

  Even in Ghazipur, where a raging poll battle ensued between Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari's brother Sibgatullah Ansari and BJP's Alka Rai, wife of slain BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai, the poll percentage went close to 60%. Jaunpur and Bhadohi registered a voting percentage of 58.73% and 58.30%, respectively.
  

  

  Out of all seven phases, highest voting percentage of nearly 65.5% in this assembly election was recorded in the second phase in which 11 west UP districts covering 67 assembly constituencies went to polls. The first phase -- covering 73 assembly constituencies in 15 districts inwest UP -- too saw a voting percentage of around 64.5%. Thereafter, the turnout dipped with the sixth phase posting lowest 57%.
  

  

  ""Over all the assembly elections turned out to be free and fair and peaceful,'' said Venkatesh. He said that the commission was analysing the figures for further perusal and references."

With campaigning over for one of the most keenly watched and caustic assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in recent times, political heavyweights, as also their foot soldiers, now have their eyes set on which way the last phase goes on Wednesday and then the vote count on March 11.
  

  

  Over a dozen helicopters and private planes that were used by the bigwigs of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have gone back to the hangers and beta's of all hues have had a ""good night sleep"" after an arduous campaign of more than two months.
  

  

  Sources told IANS that chief minister Akhilesh Yadav spent quality time with his children after a long time on Monday and got a long sleep after a hectic campaign that saw him hili-hopping across most parts of Uttar Pradesh. Desperate to retain his chair against a resurgent BJP and BSP, Yadav addressed a whopping 221 rallies in 36 days, spending almost five-six hours flying.
  

  

  ""He has lead an amazing campaign without showing any signs of being tired or irritated and we are hopeful that the toil will reap us a good electoral harvest on March 11,"" a close aide informed IANS.
  

  

  The Chief Minister's wife, Dimple Yadav, and also the Lok Sabha MP from Kannauj, also hit the campaign trail like never before.
  

  

  Playing a quiet role, she was occasionally seen in public and government functions in the last five years but didn't speak much. This time around, the electorate saw her transformation and she campaigned with a flair, taking on the BSP's Mayawati and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Accompanied by senior party leader Juhi Singh, she addressed as many as 33 rallies to drum up support for her husband.
  

  

  Missing from there scene, however, was former SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who unlike last assembly polls in 2012, just addressed four rallies. Of these three were for family members who are in the fray and one for old colleague Parasnath Yadav. In the last polls he led from the front and addressed 100-plus rallies.
  

  

  Modi, after a hectic back-to-back roads shows over three days in his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi and a 'dharmik parikrama' of various temples, is back to his daily chores. Having addressed 23 rallies in the state over the two months, Modi is flew to his native Gujarat on Tuesday to inaugurate India's longest cable bridge and for many other engagements, that include a visit to the Somnath temple.
  

  

  BJP chief Amit Shah, who had a whirlwind campaigning schedule, is also out for some quiet moments, away from the hurly burly of politics. After addressing more than 200 rallies in a two month-long campaign, Shah is back to his bungalow in Lutyens Delhi and is monitoring development at the BJP's Ashok Road office.
  

  

  Keshav Prasad Maurya, the BJP's UP unit chief, has been driving in his SUV for almost four months now and has taken a ""chota sa break,"" a party leader informed, but is marshaling the party cadres for the last round in Poorvanchal, which goes to polls on Wednesday. At stake are 40 seats.
  

  

  Party general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak, who also traveled extensively during the election campaign, says he is ""back to normal"". Resuming his morning walk at the Lohia Park in the posh Gomtinagar area of the state capital, he is hopeful of a BJP majority in the assembly and is now awaiting the March 11 vote count.
  

  

  Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, who has been the chief minister four times, fiercely tried to regain lost ground and romp home to power.
  

  

  Ably assisted by party leaders Satish Chandra Mishra and Naseemuddin Siddiqui, she led a brave campaign amid reports that the ""elephant was a poor third"" and held sway over her Dalit vote bank. She addressed 52 major rallies across the state and logged more than 60 flying hours.

"Election campaign never happens amidst us 'untouchables': say Moksh giving Doms of Kashi","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/election-campaign-never-happens-amidst-us-untouchables-say-moksh-giving-doms-of-kashi/articleshow/57541452.cms","VARANASI: The funeral pyre has been set, logs and the dead fixed in their place at the holy Harishchandra Ghat and the family of the deceased has climbed up several stones to fetch embers from the undying fire of Kalu Dom Raja, the legendary keeper of the holy flame.
  

  

  While a dying Hindu might not find Moksh (release from the cycle of rebirth) unless the 'untouchable' Dom gives 'Mukhagni' to the pyre, the scheduled caste community settled along the Harishchandra and Manikarnika Ghats in Varanasi, however lives a secluded life.
  

  

  Sans any political representation and will from parties to work for them, the community feels it has been lagged behind in education and employment all these years, facing discrimination and jostling with age old taboos for women, even in today's times.
  

  

  
  

  

  According to the 2011 Census, Uttar Pradesh has a population of 1,10,353 Doms primarily settled in Varanasi.
  

  

  ""We are descendants of Kalu Dom Raja who was the owner of Satyawaadi Raja Harishchandra after he had given away all his belongings from his kingdom to his family and clothes to the sage Vishwamitra on the latter's perusal. He used to do his duty as a Dom here in Kashi and so devoted was he to his work and to truth that even when his son Rohitdas died, he asked his wife for karmdaan. When she tore the sides of her sari to give the same, the Gods descended on to Earth grieving for Harishchandra. It was because of him that we came to be known even though the community has been doing this work since the time death existed,"" said Pawan Chowdhury, a Dom popularly known as 'doctor' in the community.
  

  

  Drenched in history and legend, the community has however been unable to move ahead of the work, the stench of which fills up every second of the breeze that flows across the fabled cremation ghats. ""It has been over ten years that we have been asking successive governments to restore the Kalu Dom Raja Mahal but nothing was done. For four continuous months when the Ganga is flooded, the ghats cannot be used for cremation and we have to burn the dead in the narrow alleys of our slum like homes, filling even our personal lives with the filthy work. But not one government has considered out demand for a platform at the Harishchandra Ghat,"" said Chowdhury.
  

  

  
  

  

  Poking at the burning dead with bamboo so as to shake off the accumulating carbon, Babu Chowdhury said, ""The ghat alone has a voter population of 1400-1500 untouched by any election campaign. We have no homes, no incentives, no schemes reaching us. The only time someone comes to us in humility is when they are dead. And the community claims it is not untouched by discrimination either. ""It is lower than in older times but even now when people come to know who we are, they distance themselves. Kehte hain, dekho ye body jalake aaya hai, sata toh nahi hoga usse, baas toh nahi laga hoga (They say look he has come after burning the dead, what if the body and the bamboo has touched him), even after we have cleaned up properly,"" said Raju Dom.
  

  

  At the Manikarnika Ghat considered to be the holier of the two cremation grounds, the scene is no different. Bodies after bodies have been entering through narrow lanes, taking embers from the claimed to be 22,000 old burning fire of the Dom Raja who sits guarding it religiously. ""Not more than five to six years back, we used to get Rs 85 for the work, Rs 15 for giving the fire and Rs 50 for burning the dead that takes around three hours per body. Now the price is around Rs 300. But what is that money in these times? How can we teach our children and get ration to eat?"" said Mata Prasad. ""The fact remains that no government thinks of us. Why can't they keep two municipal workers to clean up the ghats after the work, that is currently left onto us too.
  

  

  
  

  

  Should we do our menial work or clean the ghats? This is the bare minimum,"" said Vishwanath Chowdhury, Dom Raja at Manikarnika Ghat. The ghat is said to be the abode of Shiv and Parvati when they were on a tour of Kashi as also the place where Shiv's earring (kundal) had fallen off while taking a bathe, heance the name 'Manikarnika'.
  

  

  Struggling under one political party to another, a few youth from the community have now taken up a few initiatives, collecting funds from within the community. One such is the cremation of destitute unclaimed bodies bring brought to the ghat. ""The gadiyas who were made incharge of the work by the police to dispose of such bodies would drag them down the steps leaving behind a trail of blood, and drown the bodies directly in Ganga in the limited money they got for the work. Three years back we took over the task for free and now even the unclaimed is given a proper end,"" said Pawan.
  

  

  To move forward from the tag of being down on the social ladder, the youth have also started a Ganga Arti at the Harishchandra Ghat since February 1 to attract tourists and jostle for equal space. The ghats around the cremation grounds have also been taken up by the Doms for beautification setting up a flower garden."

Jokhu did not live to see his dream getting fulfilled but Bheeru, along with his family, was among the first to cast vote in Majhauli village on Wednesday morning.
  

  

  ""My grandfather believed reservation to Duddhi would be a milestone in the tribal struggle as it would make our voice heard in Vidhan Sabha and help bring tribals to the mainstream,"" said Bheeru, now 22. ""It also boosts our demand to create a separate Duddhi district because Sonbhadra is huge-one of the biggest districts in UP-and voices from remote villages of Duddhi never reach headquarters,"" he added.
  

  

  Excitement across tribal-dominated Duddhi was similar. UP's last constituency was declared reserved for ST along with neighbouring Obra. Duddhi was earlier reserved for Scheduled Castes and Obra was unreserved. Both constituencies are rural. The demand to declare Duddhi ST was first raised in 1960s, but the movement that had lost steam over the years revived in 2000.
  

  

  ""I think ST status will also bring more funds for education, health and drinking water,"" said Rakesh Baiga, a teacher in Derma village. In Devahar, more than 250 voters walked 10km to reach their booth. ""The first thing we want is a road in this hilly, forested area,"" they said.
  

  

  In Rantola village, early voters were women. Phoolbasia, 67, said ST status to constituencies will help in inclusion of several forest communities not recognised as tribes as yet.
  

  

  Manas, from Kurwa village, however, said a lot will depend on the person elected. ""Though the constituency has been reserved now, some MLAs in the past were from tribal communities but they did nothing substantial,"" he said.
  

  

  Besides Sushi and Obra, elections were also held in two other assembly constituencies-Robertsganj and Ghorawal. Borders with Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand were sealed since Tuesday. Since the district has a history of Naxalism, central paramilitary forces were deployed."

  Yadav said the party, along with the Congress, will get ""absolute majority"" in the state Assembly as he ruled out possibility of a hung verdict.
  

  

  ""The Samajwadi Party-Congress combine is set to get absolute majority. We will win 236-240 seats... there is no question of hung assembly,"" the party general secretary told reporters on Parliament premises.
  

  

  To a question on the BJP forming the government in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav said it is ""not aware"" of ground realities.
  

  

  On the other hand, expelled SP leader Amar Singh said BJP has got an ""advantage"" over its rivals in the bitterly-fought Assembly elections.
  

  

  With ""opposition parties using expletives"" against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said the BJP stands to benefit from it electorally.
  

  

  Asserting that the BJP will have an edge over all other parties in the polls, Singh claimed that the BSP too will surpass the SP's tally.
  

  

  On whether the BJP and the BSP will come together if the elections throw up a hung verdict, the Rajya Sabha member said, ""UP is a wonderful state and politics is a game of possibilities"".

  While Priyanka Gandhi's
  absence+
  from electioneering surprised many, the AICC general secretary in-charge of UP said she was more engaged than before. ""She played a bigger role than physical campaigning by managing and monitoring the election. Election management involves deployment of leaders, coordinating their movement and work across the state. This was done under her leadership in Delhi. She was deeply involved in UP elections,"" he said.
  

  

  As the
  long-drawn polling in UP drew to a close+
  , Azad told TOI, ""BJP and Modi did their level-best but the majority community and the saner elements did not like their utterances, especially those from the PM. People of India are not ready to accept this talk of shamshan-kabristan.""
  

  

  Azad said he spoke to Hindus, especially those belonging to BJP, and they were all of the opinion that Modi's statement was uncalled for. ""A PM is custodian of all religions. He belongs to all, those who voted for him and those who did not. Whoever advised the PM to make this statement has done a great disservice to the country. The PM should not be put in a position where he is seen as belonging to one community,"" he added.
  

  

  He argued that PM's remarks could not have much effect because ""people at lower level"" are aware that land requirements for a 'shamshan' and 'kabristan' are different, the latter needing more area.
  

  

  After a month of steering the seemingly contradictory
  alliance+
  with one-time arch rival Samajwadi Party, Azad said the two partners managed a perfect coordination which ""could not be better"" and ""was better than any alliance that Congress ran in other states"".
  

  

  Claiming that SP-Congress alliance will win UP polls, he said the reference point for BJP's performance could not be the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. ""2014 was a different story. The national and state elections do not follow the same pattern,"" he argued."

  ""I want to ask him (Modi) to give an account of his three years' work as I am doing for my five years as CM. BJP had to do many road shows seeing response of SP-Congress' historic show in Varanasi,"" he told a news conference here.
  

  

  Attacking Modi for raising power failure issue, Akhilesh claimed there was no power cut in Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
  

  

  ""In the temple, as prayers were to be held someone mistakenly switched off the lights instead of fans,"" he said denying PM's charge that wherever polls were over power cuts had started.

  ""We want to know what BJP wanted to do? Which expressway do they want to construct. What has the Centre done for women's security?"" he said, adding only SP could take the state forward.
  

  

  On developing Varanasi like Kyoto, Akhilesh said as SP was going to form the government again after March 11, he wanted to invite detailed project report from the Centre and its best architects and town planners and would help in making the city the best.

He further alleged that it's not Akhilesh's work that speaks, but it's ""looted money"" by the SP government that speaks across the state.
  

  

  Mishra claimed that the SP-Congress alliance would hardly get 55-65 seats as people are ready to wipe out Akhilesh government from the state in this assembly polls.

He further added, ""This SP government was known for corruption only and all the departments are involved in neck-deep corrupt practices.""
  

  

  Mishra claimed, ""The expressway, being constructed by the Akhilesh Government, is a lively example of corruption and whenever CBI probe gets done into construction of expressway, the truth would come out.""
  

  

  ""The ruling SP government is merely involved in caste-based politics and apart from one caste, people of other castes are crying for justice,"" said Mishra, adding ""as far as employment is concerned, the ruling government has favoured one caste only,"" he added. He claimed that Nishad party is going to win majority of seats in this assembly election.

  A day earlier, the chief minister was critical of the media for their ""unfair"" reporting during the election campaign. ""We did not get live coverage while others (referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP leaders) got more than required space on TV channels. It was a type of corruption"" lamented the chief minister .
  

  

  The chief minister regretted ""some people"" projected themselves as poor in media eye by feeding grass to cows. Akhilesh Yadav said, ""He (prime minister) has no idea of how to feed the cows. In rural areas grass is cut in before it is mixed with fodder to feed the animals. The prime minister does not know because he has never lived in village and only wants photographs showing him feeding cows to appear. We have lived among the farmers and the poor, we know how to feed the cows.""
  

  

  Speaking about the books, the chief minister praised principal secretary of UP Assembly Pradip Dubey for producing such marvellous books which could be an asset for politicians as well as social scientists and students. He said he had not attended the UP Assembly when Mulayam Singh was chief minister but had read his speeches which motivated him to do a lot for the poor, vulnerable and the farmers.

  ABP's exit poll projects the BJP will win as many as 185 seats of the 403 Assembly seats. Even though this represents a big gain from 2012, when it won a mere 47 seats, the BJP will still fall 16 seats short of a majority. The Samajwadi Party (SP) - Congress alliance is expected to get just 120 seats, down from the 252 seats the SP won in the 2012 elections, ABP's poll says. The BSP is expected to have performed slightly better than in 2012, winning 90 seats, up from 80 in 2012.

They are now called Rajbhars, a touch of royalty with ""raj"" added to their community name. The Nonias are Chauhans. Potters are no longer Kohars, but Prajapatis.
  

  

  The BJP's social engineering that focuses on nonYadav OBCs has changed the way OBCs that missed the Mandal mileage, are being addressed and looked at.
  

  

  Sensing electoral bene fits from empowering the politically isolated non-Yadav OBCs, parties wooed them hard. Several candidates are from these castes and many could win. People, even from the dominant upper castes, have changed their attitude towards them. The BJP has fielded around 150 OBCs.
  

  

  Among the non-Yadav OBCs prominent are Lodhs, Kurmis, Kushwahas, Rajbhars, Chauhans and kevats. The Lodhs are the only ones who've experienced some uplift after their caste leader Kalyan Singh became CM.
  

  

  As for the others, they got no benefits well after the Mandal Commission recom mendations were implemented. Senior Kurmi politician Keshav Prasad Maurya was with BSP and his caste voted for Mayawati's party.
  

  

  This is the first time that the non-Yadav OBCs have emerged a decisive vote bank as they have shown the resolve to demand their share of the development pie and eagerness to end the ""disproportionate empha sis"" on Yadavs.
  

  

  Among the prominent BJP candidates in the fray is party OBC Morcha chief Dara Singh Chauhan, a Nonia, against Abbas, son of Mukhtar Ansari at Ghosi.Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party president Om Prakash Rajbhar, contesting as a BJP alliance candidate from Jahoorabad, appears to have polarised the Rajbhar community .

Earlier in the day , the baraat party had walked through various streets of Kashi, shouting 'Modi Bhai's' name before reaching the Maidagin situated Jain temple whilst dancing to popular Bollywood tunes.
  

  

  ""Modi bhai is our godfather. It fills our hearts with pride to see that the Prime Minister is a Gujarati who is working for the country ,"" said Roshan Gujarati, the groom's eldest brother. On the radio at a shop in Gol Ghar, Modi's vote appeals blares through the speaker enchanting bystanders with the connection he draws between Gujarat and Varanasi as his `janm bhoomi' and `karm bhoomi' respectively.

"Spectre of hung Assembly looms over Uttar Pradesh","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/spectre-of-hung-assembly-looms-over-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/57534237.cms","LUCKNOW: The iconic dialogue - picture abhi baaki hai, mere dost - from Shah Rukh Khan's Bollywood movie 'Om Shanti Om' could well describe the current poll scenario in Uttar Pradesh where a hung Assembly is a possibility.
  

  

  Party insiders are not discounting chances of a fractured verdict after the seven phases of polling come to an end on Wednesday in the absence of any wave.
  

  

  After all the key players talked about notching up 300 plus of the 403 seats, talks of a hung house suddenly gained momentum in the last phases of polling with Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself flagging the possibility of a hung assembly in the state.
  

  

  Modi said SP and BSP were waiting for such an opportunity for bargaining, prompting Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to comment that after dreaming of 300 plus seats, Modi was now talking about a fractured verdict.
  

  

  The contest is between the BJP, the ruling Samajwadi Party along with partner Congress and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party, which is looking to script a comeback in the state.
  

  

  To win 202 or 50 per cent seats this year, a party will need to get 35 per cent of the vote share. Five years ago, the Samajwadi Party had needed just 29 per cent of the vote share to win 226 seats.
  

  

  Mayawati's party had won only 80 seats with 26 per cent votes.
  

  

  The two regional heavyweights saw a steep fall two years later, with the BJP and its ally Apna Dal sweeping the 2014 general election, winning 73 of UP's 80 seats with 42 per cent of the vote share.
  

  

  The BJP can afford to lose 7 per cent of its vote share from 2014 to still win this year, while SP-Congress must gain 6 per cent to reach 35 per cent, and BSP will have to stretch about 15 per cent to win.
  

  

  The BJP is counting on its core support base - urban voters, the youth and upper caste voters, while Akhilesh hopes to consolidate his party's traditional Muslim-Yadav vote bank with his partnership with the Congress and is also targeting the Muslims who may vote for the BSP.
  

  

  Mayawati's party is seeking to consolidate its hold in rural UP and has fielded about 100 Muslim candidates to win support from that community.
  

  

  Voters threw hung houses in the state for 14 years and that trend changed from 2007 when people decided to deliver a clear mandate.
  

  

  This time, with no clear wave in favour of any party and each of the key players claiming to get over 300 of the 403 seats at stake, party insiders say the outcome is unlikely to go in one direction.
  

  

  Increasingly seen as the 'bellwether' for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the results will not only decide as to who will rule UP but show which way the wind is blowing ahead of the Lok Sabha elections two years hence.
  

  

  The Assembly elections are being viewed as 'CM Sey PM Tak' (From CM to PM) as Modi will be aspiring for a second run.
  

  

  With the presidential polls also due later this year, UP's strength will be at full play, raising the stakes of all major parties. BJP's one-fourth of Lok Sabha strength comes from UP.
  

  

  But after three clear verdicts in the 2007, 2012 and 2014 general elections, the spectre of a hung house looms large over the state once again with party insiders saying the main reason being the absence of any single issue binding the state.
  

  

  Demonetisation could play both ways for the BJP, analysts said.
  

  

  Besides, a split in the traditional vote banks on caste and communal lines and shifting loyalties have thrown spanners in the scheme of things of key parties.
  

  

  Muslims were highly confused whether to stick to SP or switch over to BSP in view of the factional feuds in the ruling party, which they have supported traditionally post the Babri Masjid demolition.
  

  

  But this time around they have been wooed by BSP to the hilt with Mayawati giving nearly 100 tickets to Muslims and asking the community not to fritter away their votes and in the process help BJP.
  

  

  SP, on the other hand, cautioned the Muslims not to back BSP, saying Mayawati had fielded so many Muslim candidates to indirectly help the saffron party - pre-poll and if need be post-poll too.
  

  

  Confusion over the chief ministerial face of BJP and not giving tickets to any Muslim candidate could affect the prospects of the saffron party in addition to note-ban pain, feel political pundits.
  

  

  Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Uma Bharti and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi have said on record that BJP could have given tickets to the community.
  

  

  Rajnath also said BJP's position would have been stronger if SP had not forged alliance with Congress. His remarks came amid reports that Muslims might support the fledgling coalition.
  

  

  The political scene in Uttar Pradesh has been dominated by the SP and BSP since 1990s, and if the BJP came to power in the state, it was courtesy the BSP or by breaking small parties to cobble up a majority in the state assembly.
  

  

  The ruling SP could have performed better had the family feud not played a spoiler. The party has been battered by bitter power struggle between Akhilesh and his uncle Shivpal, who is supported by his father and party patriarch Mulayam, and the feud between the warring factions refused to die down.
  

  

  The chief minister took control of the party on January 1 after ousting Mulayam at an ""emergency national convention"" and also sacked his uncle as the party's state unit chief. He also did not want parliamentarian Amar Singh in the party.
  

  

  Then came the fight for its symbol 'bicycle' over which both the factions had laid claim before the Election Commission, giving enough indication that any reconciliation was unlikely.
  

  

  The BSP led by firebrand Mayawati was considered a strong claimant for the chief minister's post till it an exodus of senior leaders from the party.
  

  

  The BSP's core vote of 21.5 per cent Dalits is not intact. The rainbow coalition of Dalits, Muslims and Brahmins that had brought her to power in 2007 has also split up.
  

  

  Though the BSP's Brahmin face SC Misra extensively toured the state, her party's fate is in the hands of the Muslims.
  

  

  The BJP has been eyeing UP ever since its spectacular victory in 2014. Its national president Amit Shah launched a spate of public mobilisation programmes including the Parivartan Yatra.
  

  

  However, their trump card is Narendra Modi who remains a popular figure in the state. He has also been working on stitching alliances with various castes as well as smaller parties.
  

  

  The state's senior leader Rajnath Singh has appealed to the masses to end their 14-year-long 'vanvaas' (exile).
  

  

  The party's demonetisation gamble, seen as a national movement against corruption and black money, could boomerang given the hardships faced by people in the countryside post-note ban.
  

  

  The Congress, on its part, has been making efforts to revive the party in the state it ruled for about 40 years. Since 1990 it has been living with a tag of an 'also ran party' in the elections.
  

  

  There are other smaller players who will be taking away votes and playing spoilers on seats heading for a close finish, thereby raising the possibility of a hung Assembly, political observers noted.
  

  

  UP has the dubious distinction of being placed under President's Rule 10 times."

Proud of their history and connection with Lord Rama (as descendants of Shabari), they start a battle against extreme poverty and joblessness every morning but return empty-handed.
  

  

  Sudeep Kol was better off than many of his community in 1971 because he owned five bighas land. In 1973, the land was acquired for the Adwa Dam project. ""There was resentment among farmers, so then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promised equal land in return,"" said Sudeep who lends his face to 900 others. As representatives of various political parties rally behind him ahead of the elections, they wonder if her grandson Rahul can fulfil Indira's promise. ""My patta was fixed by Indira Gandhi and though her party is not in power in UP, her grandson came here with chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, so let us see if he can fulfil his grandmother's promise,"" said Prabhu Lal. In the past 40 years, these farmers have represented the matter to local administration, fell on the feet of bureaucrats and pleaded to politicians but to no avail. ""All our papers are in place but we couldn't get possession because the property is encroached by musclemen,"" said Prabhu.
  

  

  Elders continue to try and are waiting, while the younger generation is fast migrating. Prabhu Lal, son of Rajesh has started working as a security personnel in Mumbai. ""I want my land back so that we can grow crops and get food. We are farmers who have turned into beggars because we have not got our rightful due,"" rued Sudeep who works as a labour to meet the ends.""We go hungry whenever I cannot work,"" he said.
  

  

  Influenced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's emotional discourse during his radio talk `Mann Ki Baat', Kols want to plead at this doorstep but are scared of the musclemen who have encroached their land. ""We are planning to write to the PM as some of us may lose our life in the rebellion against musclemen,"" said Sudeep.

  Poor turn into ready bait for moneylenders
  

  

  Poverty has pushed almost every Kol in Hallia into the trap of private moneylenders. ""The rate (of interest) is Rs12-15 per Rs100 per month in lieu of guarantee,"" said Sudeep Kol who can never understand the mathematics of interest levied on him.
  

  

  A pradhan working against money lending explained how the borrower ends up repaying several times more. ""The interest is charged on the amount as Rs150 per 100 per month for the time period borrowed, so if a person borrows Rs1,000 from the moneylender at the rate of Rs15 per hundred per month for one year. He pays Rs150 per month as interest in addition to the instalment,"" he said.
  

  

  So in one year, the borrower ends up paying Rs1,800 as interest, 80% more than the amount taken. Adding the original amount borrowed takes the payment made Rs2,800. Defaulters pay even more because they pay the moneylender charges for time period extended. Chances are that borrower will lose the guarantee mortgaged."

  The presence of Narendra Modi in the race from Varanasi in that election obviously made a difference, but the BJP has made it all about Modi once again and thrown everything into this last phase. On the face of it, there should be no reason for it to expect a tough fight here, because even the combined SP-Congress vote share of 23% in 2014 was over 18 percentage points behind the BJP-AD combine's share of 41.6%.
  

  

  BSP, with 21.2%, finished ahead of SP on votes in this part but still well behind the saffron combine. But BJP would be aware that just two years earlier, in 2012, it had been reduced to an also-ran with both SP and BSP polling higher than their state-wide averages in this region and BJP's vote share being just 11.5%. The Congress' share of 8.7% also well short of its state average.
  

  

  This was not really reflected in the seat tallies with SP winning the lion's share (23) and BSP, BJP, Congress and 'Others' sharing the remaining 17 seats more or less equally. The last two elections would suggest that the main rival for anybody in this part should be BSP, but the coming together of SP and Congress for these elections makes such assumptions far from obvious.
  

  

  Being the last phase, perceptions about what's happened in the earlier phases could play an important role in determining the voter's choice. Given the Indian voter's tendency to try and avoid ""wasting"" his or her vote, a party or alliance that's perceived to have done badly in the initial phases could well see its base shrinking in this part, making it somewhat closer to a two-horse race. That could also lead to important vote banks switching preferences at the last minute."
"Speaker to sack MLAs who defected before polls","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/speaker-to-sack-mlas-who-defected-before-polls/articleshow/57550161.cms","LUCKNOW: Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav may have still not decided to dismiss his cabinet minister Gayatri Prajapti who is facing rape charges and is on the run, UP Assembly Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey has decided to disqualify nearly 20 MLAs who had defected from their parties to join rivals before the elections.
  

  

  Highly placed sources told ToI on Wednesday that MLAs likely to be disqualified include former UPCC chief MLA Rita Bahuguna Joshi and BSP's Leader of Opposition Swami Prasad Maurya, both of whom joined the BJP.
  

  

  Their disqualification would be of academic interest and for the record of the State Assembly, as for the practical purposes , they have already enjoyed pay and perks throughout their tenure and the disqualification comes only when they have contested the elections from new political party quitting their parent party, said sources.
  

  

  About six MLAs of the BSP had quit their party to join the BJP and MLAs from the SP, Congress and RLD had also joined new parties as they felt they would not be able to win from their seat from their parent party , though some of them had been sacked by their original party for their anti-party activities.
  

  

  Justice delayed is justice denied was the grievance of political parties who had petitioned before the Speaker seeking the disqualification of the MLAs of their party for having deserted and joined the new party and Pandey lost no time in taking action, the sources remarked."
"How all parties wooed women voters","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/how-all-parties-wooed-women-voters/articleshow/57568245.cms","LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh's women have played a vital role in the unprecedented voter turnout in the state's 2017 assembly polls. The historic overall first division score this year was made possible by women voters staying the course and maintaining a consistent 63.26% polling up from 61% in 2012.
  

  

  The significant rise in the number of women voters, psephologists say, is not without dedicated efforts by political parties to woo them.
  

  

  The Samajwadi Party, traditionally known to allow the muscle culture to flourish, made its first key effort to win over women by launching the 1090 Women's Power Line in UP. The dedicated round-the-clock call centre for women in distress, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said, was aimed at assuring women that the ruling SP government was keen to secure not just urban women, but also those in rural UP, where they felt vulnerable under SP rule. Akhilesh followed up on the power line with the launch of UP-100, another government initiative to provide police support to rural and urban areas in the state within 20 minutes of receiving a complaint on the 24-hour emergency support system.
  

  

  While the exact impact of the initiative remains unclear, the trademark UP-100 vehicles are now visible across the state in rural and urban areas. The second initiative by the SP aimed at endearing women was the Samajwadi Pension Yojana under which BPL women received a monthly pension of Rs 500. In a bid to provide enhanced financial security to women in the state, the CM has promised to double the amount to Rs 1,000 if re-elected to power.
  

  

  The BJP, too, worked hard on wooing UP's women. The Prime Minister's Ujjawala scheme, launched across India from East UP's Gorakhpur district, provides free LPG gas connections and stoves to BPL woman. The scheme instantly reached out to a captive rural audience that had, for years, cooked on wood or earthen fire. The free gas connections are believed to have won over the women to the saffron side. Closer to the end of UP polls, the BJP also came up with the promise of setting up anti-Romeo squads, once again, promised to protect women folk against errant men in UP. While the initiative had clear communal overtones, the initiative is believed to be targeting women and securing their persons.
  

  

  Bahujan Samaj Party though did not make any direct promises to women voters in UP, it laid repeated emphasis on the party's ability to get an iron grip over the law and order condition in the state. In continuation of this, in the 2017 elections, the BSP chief's campaigns have also focused on her ability to safeguard UP's 'behen betiyan'. With her administrative record, there are few who could doubt her ability to keep UP's goons in check."

  The Samajwadi Party, which won a majority in the 2012 assembly elections on its own, contested the 2017 elections in alliance with the Congress. However, the exit polls today showed that tie-up didn't really do much for the SP.
  

  

  Senior SP leader Ravidas Mehrotra said his party would have won on its own and there was no need to likely have gained from the alliance and not the SP.
  

  

  Aside from SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mehrotra is the first senior leader to express his feelings against the alliance in public.
  

  

  In private though, several party leaders and workers have been questioning the decision from the start.
  

  

  In the event the SP-Congress combine fails to win on March 11, there will be more dissenters coming out in the open against the alliance.
  

  

  The exit polls have predicted a hung assembly in the state with the BJP projected to emerge as the single largest party, winning anywhere between 164 and 210 of the 403 seats.
  

  

  Times Now-VMR's poll forecast 190-210 seats for the BJP in the UP assembly, India News-MRC gave it 185 and ABP- Lokniti CSDS projected the BJP will win 164-176 seats.

  The BJP has had nearly 25 Union ministers make Varanasi their hub for the final phases before Modi's three-day blitzkrieg of rallies and special visits. The Kashi Vishwanath temple, no stranger to VVIPs, saw Modi drop by for a darshan on Saturday , followed hours later by Congress's Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav with wife Dimple who stopped their ""vikas rath"" mid-way for a darshan.
  

  

  It's been close to two months of an energetic campaign complete with slogans, barbs, bites and unsavoury comments. When elections were announced on January 4, the Samajwadis were embroiled in a nasty family war amid speculation that the party's bicycle symbol may be frozen.But Akhilesh's victory on the family front and SP's unprecedented alliance with Congress changed the narrative. The alliance -with a 31% vote share even during the 2014 Modi wave ahead of the Lok Sabha polls and bolstered by two young faces -emerged a formidable force, making the contest a threecornered thriller.
  

  

  The chemistry between Akhilesh and Rahul made their five roadshows and four joint rallies a huge draw. This apart from their solo shows -Rahul had over 50, Akh ilesh over 230.
  

  

  For the BJP , out of power in UP for 15 years, the results will verily be a mid-term ap praisal of its past two and a half years at the Centre.

  While party chief Amit Shah's booth level manage ment started a year in ad vance, the party gave tickets g o ing deep into caste cal culations. Its thrust on `winnability' forced the party to embrace several turncoats as nominees, sending its cadre into a sulk at places. Mayawati's BSP -smarting after a total wipe out in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections -spotted an op portunity in SP's internal fight and played on the front foot, positioning itself as an alternative for Muslims to de feat BJP . Her core Dalit votes combined with that of 20% Muslims, believes the BSP chief, will enable her party to reach the magic figure of 202.
  

  

  But BSP's Dalit-Muslim equation didn't appear as formidable once the SP-Congress tie-up was in place. This was seen in western UP and Rohilkhand districts: Muslims voted for BSP or the alliance depending on the candidate best placed to defeat BJP.

Women forced their daughters into the trade and the girls grew around tabla, harmonium, ghungroo and ustaad, not knowing who their father was. For an outsider, it was difficult to access the ghetto without knowing a local.
  

  

  Till up to three decades back, a lot of women in Pashchim Chhor made a living as courtesan of well-heeled zamindars. It was an era of mujras. But by late 1980s and early 90s, fed up of constant harassment, many females shifted to Mumbai, Kolkata and other places as bar dancers or sex workers. Immoral trafficking act was amended in 1986 and policemen often landed at their doorstep for money. But things are changing now.

  Meanwhile, a man with strong views on social issues is meeting 8,500 people in Basuka, Shambu Nath Rai (75) is advocating NOTA. As a youth, Rai led from the front during the JP movement while he worked as advocate in Bihar and ensured Razia's victory in panchayat elections. He would vote for the first time on March 8. ""Parties talk about development but in reality UP election is being fought over religion or caste,"" shared Rai airing his views on existing political scenario.
  

  

  Rai lambasted the sitting MLAs from Mohammadabad assembly segment (BSP's Sibghatullah Ansari) and Zamania assembly segment (SP's O P Singh) for not developing important roads. ""Pregnant women have been forced to abort child due to complications. The road is so bumpy they had miscarriage while going to the hospital,"" said Rai. He feels Supreme Court will take a strong view on the existing political system if significant number of voters will press NOTA. ""And that is why I have decided to vote for the first time,"" he said."

  The Opposition party also alleged that he was taking ""anti-people"" decisions through the backdoor only to benefit private individuals and dubbed his government as ""Government of India Private Limited"".
  

  

  It also said that the bias against the poor and the middle class is evident in the policies of this government which is privatising health, education and stopping HIV medicines for chidren in a ""conspiracy against the country"".
  

  

  ""Amit Shah ji has told all the party MPs of Uttar Pradesh that if they get less than 2-3 seats, they will be held accountable and action will be taken against them. So I believe the Prime Minister has also been told the same thing and he is responding to Amit Shah ji's threat. He is also scared that he may not win those 2-3 seats from his own constituency,"" party spokesperson Ajoy Kumar told reporters when asked if there was a 'leadership deficit' in the BJP as Modi was camping in Varanasi for days together.
  

  

  ""Modi ji is scared of Amit Shah's statement and is trying to save his pride by camping there,"" he said.
  

  

  He cited four recent announcements to accuse Modi of ""backstabbing"" and ""betrayal"" of the country's common people as such decisions are taken through ""backdoor"" in the din of electioneering.
  

  

  ""In this election season, where people are watching his 'blitz' Modi ji is taking anti-people decisions through back door! Modi ji's new slogan is 'cashless cashless japna, janta ka paisa apna',"" he said.
  

  

  Hitting out at Modi over State Bank of India's decision to impose penalties for non-maintenance of minimum balance in savings bank accounts, Kumar said, ""Modi ji has backstabbed the poor people of this country by levying charges on not maintaining minimum balance in bank accounts.""
  

  

  He also said this is not the first time that the Modi government forced the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to increase third party motor insurance premiums.
  

  

  Pointing toward the waiving of Vijay Mallya's loans worth Rs 1,200 crore, he said, on the one hand Modi is spreading the red carpet for the likes of Mallya and on the other, banks are levying transaction charges.

  He said the IRDA, which is a regulatory authority for insurance, has increased motor premium of third party insurance of vehicles from 40 per cent to 101 in two years.
  

  

  Kumar also cited the steepest hike in LPG rates and doing away of the Rs 4,500 crore subsidy on sugar provided to the poor through PDS network as the two other anti-people decisions taken in the recent past in the din of electioneering.

Similarly , even if the Central government allocates money for development, if the state government is unfit then no development can ever take place.

Taking a dig at chief minister Akhilesh Yadav while quoting SP's poll slogan `Kaam Bolta Hai', Shah said, ""Have you seen SP's work speak? Let me present before you the achievements of SP government under its regime, the state has topped the charts in rape, murder, robbery , kidnapping and goonda gardi (lawlessness).

The words of this man, who they believe embodies their deity Ghasi Ghanshyam, is final.
  

  

  So, if he tells them to go to the city and see a doctor, the Gonds will. But chances are the ojha will `handle the situation' himself by applying some `divine ash' on the body and prescribing some `magic potion'.
  

  

  One reason why UP's tribal voters, present in small numbers in Mirzapur and Varanasi, opt for the ojha is because the nearest primary health centre in Hallia is about 25km away . The road is strewn with boulders and there is no conveyance. In any case, most Gonds have no money to bear the cost of treatment in Hallia or Mirzapur.
  

  

  As they are wooed by various parties, the 1,500-odd followers of the ojha say they have to vote because it is their `dharma', although they have no idea about the candidates in the fray in their constituency Chhanbe.
  

  

  Some have heard of the big names running UP's election show. Describing PM Narendra Modi, Amarti Devi said, ""woh to budhwa admi hai...baal pakey hain.. muskiyat hai (he the old man with white hair... he smiles).""

  But who is Modi? To this, another woman, Jayapati, says, ""Woh Bharat varsh maa hain kuch... kuch bahut bada (he is something big in Bharat Varsh."" But the women weren't sure where or what `Bharat Varsh' was. The women claimed they hadn't heard of Mulayam and Akhilesh Yadav but some were aware of a party with the `cycle' symbol. ""Akhilesh.. naam suna laagat baa... par ham janit nai ki oo kaun baa (I seem to have heard the name but don't know who he is),"" said Basanti Devi. Some have heard of Indira Gandhi, but don't know her grandson Rahul. About Mayawati, Samudar Devi said, ""Thi hiyan bahut saal bhaye... kaa pata kaha chali gaiyen (she was here many years ago...no idea where she's gone).""
  

  

  All of them knew their MP Anupriya Patel as one who promised to come to a neighbouring village for a meeting but never turned up. The Gonds say the elec tions are some kind of a festival in Bharat Varsh. ""Pata nahi kaa hote baa... par neek hi hote hai (I don't know what it is.. but it is something good),"" remarked Jayapati. ""Neta log sab lariyaat hai... godh lagat hain.. binti karat hain ki ham batan dab dei (Netas roam around, touch our feet, plead to press the button in their favour),"" she added.
  

  

  The issues of these villagers, who live along the Adwya river, fail to find a place in any party's manifesto. "" Approach roads are the biggest issue... there are times when men and women walk overnight to come return from Hallia,"" said Bibhuti Mishra, founder of Prabodhini Foundation, which is working to empower women in the area.

  Sibal told the bench, also comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and SK Kaul, that Khan is willing to appear before the high court after March 11, the day when the ongoing Assembly election process gets over.

Although this phase is smallest in size, the caste dynamics and its geography makes it crucial for all the parties.
  

  

  Apart from the PM constituency, the phase also has three Naxal-affected districts — Sonbhadra, Mirzapur and Chandauli.
  

  

  Two constituencies of Sonbhadra — Duddhi and Obra — are the first to be reserved for scheduled tribes. Ghazipur, Jaunpur and Bhadohi are the other districts going to polls in this phase. Tight security has been put in place in these seven districts.
  

  

  Polling will be held between 7 am to 5 pm in all constituencies, except the Duddhi, Robertsganj and Chakia seats, where polling will end at 4 pm. A total of 1.41 crore voters, including 64.76 lakh women, are eligible to exercise their franchise in 14,458 polling booths.

  The presence of a large number of most backward class's castes in the district going to the polls has made small caste-specific parties significant players in the phase. No wonder, BJP is contesting only 32 out of 40 seats and has given four seats each to allies Apana Dal and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, which are popular among Kurmis and Rajbhars respectively.SP is contesting on 31 seats and its ally the Congress is in race for the remaining seats.
  

  

  BSP candidates on the other hand are fighting on all 40 seats. In the 2012 state assembly polls, out of these 40 seats, SP won 23 seats, BSP five, BJP four, Congress three while five seats went to smaller parties like Qaumi Ekta Dal and Independents. QED, led by Mukhtar Ansari, is now part of BSP. His elder brother Sibgatullah Ansari is contesting from Mohammadabad in this phase. Mukhtar and his son Abbas were in fray in the previous phase from Mau and Ghosi respectively
  

  

  In all, 535 candidates are in the fray. While the maximum candidates (24) are from the Varanasi Cantt seat, the minimum number of candidates (six) are contesting from Kerakat (SC).
  

  

  For the last phase, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent three days in Varanasi, where he visited temples, held a roadshow and attended a number of public events."

They are rooting for them not because they are fans of the `yuva jodi', but due to the faith that the duo, if win elections, would help them get adequate compensation and rehabilitation package as per the Land Acquisition Act 2013.
  

  

  Kanhar Irrigation Project is located downstream of the confluence of Rivers Pagan and Kanhar, a tributary of river Sone, near Sugawan village in Dudhi, UP's last constituency and one of the two reserved for scheduled tribe, in Sonbhadra district, which has history of Naxalism and shares border with Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhatisgarh and Jharkhand.Its an inter-state project, which proposes around three km long earthen dam and will submerge around 4000 hectare of land, forests, in UP , Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Though the project saw protests in all the three states, it did not become an issue in the ongoing UP elections. As a result, villagers decided to take it forward themselves. ""I sought time to meet Rahul Gandhi on Sunday when he had come to address election rally along with Akhilesh Yadav . Rahul ji not only gave a patient hearing, but also assured that he will do whatever he can to get justice for the family facing displacement threat,"" said Gambheera Prasad, head of the Kankar Bandh Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti, an association formed by locals to oppose construction of the dam. Other villagers, cutting across all castes and faiths, too have com plete faith in the Land Acquisi tion Act 2013, which they said was now their only hope, besides courts. When asked it was the Samajwadi Party government under Akhilesh Yadav which resumed the project, Raju Gond, a local tribal, claimed ""It was not Akhilesh, but his uncle's `karnama'."" Shivpal Yadav as irrigation minister revived the project.

  The revival of the over 40-year-old project was announced on December 5, 2014. Officials then said project though will affect 2000 families, but will provide livelihood, irrigation and drinking water to over 100 villages in the underdeveloped region. They also claimed that adequate compensation had been offered and many are ready to accept.
  

  

  The villagers, however, said only a handful accepted the offer, but majority opposed the project as it will submerge 11 villages completely and partially affect 85. Besides, it will destroy dense forests in the area, hitting livelihood of over 50,000 people. Over 60% population is tribal and remaining 40% comprises Yadavs, Muslims and most backward classes. All are dependent on agriculture and forest produce. Soon after the revival of the project, villagers and activists approached the National Green Tribunal, which stayed the work on December 24, 2014. Their case was based on the Land Acquisition Act 2013, which made environment and social impact study mandatory before initiation of any such project.

  It also allowed assessment of a project in retrospection. However, the work at the site did not stop and in the meantime, Modi government brought land acquisition amendment ordinance. ""We saw that the state government was not listening to us and Centre was diluting the 2013 Act, we decided to hold a massive protest on April 14, 2015, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb BR Ambedkar with the support of All India Union of Forest Working People (AIUFWP), an association fighting for the rights of tribal and Dalits,"" said Sukalo Gond, a tribal leader. According to locals, as they were as sembling at the spot, heavy police was deployed. Some policemen tried to remove protesters through force, leading to a clash. Police cane charged and opened fire, leaving 50 injured, five serious including with gun shot.
  

  

  ""Instead of a big dam, a smaller one or lift canal can provide irrigation and drinking water facility ,"" said Roma Mullic, AIUFWP deputy general secretary , who was not on the spot on April 14, but supported the agitation. ""When Rihand dam was built in the region in 1960s, it was showcased as irrigation project, thousands were displaced from over 100 villagers, but later most of the water was diverted to cement factories and power plants in the district,"" she added."

  Addressing a rally at Khushipur village in Rohaniya assembly segment, Modi, who has been campaigning in his Lok Sabha constituency for three days, repeated the promise of waiving farmers' loans and restoring professionalism of the police force if BJP comes to power in the state.
  

  

  Describing himself as a person who ""has experienced poverty and therefore wants to improve the lot of the poor"", the PM said his government was aiming at providing houses to every single household in the country by 2022, when the country celebrates 75 years of Independence.
  

  

  Modi began his 45-minute-long speech with a special mention of Apna Dal and Bharatiya Samaj Party, which are fighting 20 of the 403 seats in UP in alliance with the BJP.
  

  

  Apna Dal enjoys a following among Kurmis, the most dominant OBC group after the Yadavs, while Bharatiya Samaj Party is a breakaway group of Bahujan Samaj Party floated by Mayawati's erstwhile loyalist Om Prakash Rajbhar.
  

  

  Stressing that the country's economy heavily depended on the betterment of farmers and improvement in their purchasing power, Modi said his government was also bringing in measures to ensure that incomes of those involved in agriculture doubled by 2022.
  

  

  He also spoke about a scheme whereby five crore poor families in the country were to be given free gas connections by 2019.
  

  

  Coming down heavily on the Akhilesh Yadav government, Modi said that in BJP-ruled states 50-60 per cent farmers were covered under his Pradhan Mantri Phasal Beema Yojana but in UP only 14 per cent agriculturists were benefiting from the crop insurance scheme.
  

  

  Lambasting the SP government in the state for ""nepotism and corruption"" in competitive exams, the Prime Minister said, ""I took the decision to do away with interviews for recruitments at lower levels. This was aimed at curbing malpractices. But Akhilesh Yadav is not willing to take a cue as he wants jobbery to flourish.""
  

  

  Modi said the people of UP ""should beware of both bua and bhateeja"", terms used by Mayawati and Akhilesh to describe each other. He asserted that only BJP could restore law and order in the state where ""women are afraid to go out of their homes unless accompanied by a male member of the family"".
  

  

  The Prime Minister, who returned to New Delhi after the rally, began his day with a visit to Garhwa Ghat ashram - a monastery run by a sect devoted to the Bhakti tradition.
  

  

  Headed by Swami Sharanananda, the sect is said to have a significant following among Yadavs, who have traditionally been SP supporters.
  

  

  From Garhwa Ghat, Modi went to Ramghat, where he paid floral tributes at a statue of Lal Bahadur Shastri and also spent a few minutes at the house where the former Prime Minister had spent his early childhood.
  

  

  Voting for the seventh and final phase will take place on March 8 and declaration of results is scheduled for March 11.
  

  

  Referring to the festival of Holi, which falls on March 13, Modi urged the people of Kashi to cast their votes judiciously so that ""Holi may be celebrated in UP on March 11, two days ahead of schedule"".
  

  

  The PM's speech was, on one occasion, interrupted for a couple of minutes when he was distracted by a number of youths who were heartily chanting ""Modi! Modi!"". The PM asked them to keep quiet and jocularly told camerapersons shooting the rally ""do not focus your lenses on them"".

  Modi spoke at length about his government's pro-poor and pro-farmer initiatives, which included soil health cards which he compared to ""pathological tests advised by physicians before prescribing medicines"".
  

  

  ""We are ensuring that certified, good quality seeds are made available to farmers so that they do not end up buying sub-standard ones from the black market and ruining their own fields. To those farmers whose water pumps have worn away, we are providing new ones free of cost,"" he said.

  ""Adequate availability of water enables a hard-working farmer to convert his fields into a goldmine. Our irrigation schemes are aimed at building canals in large numbers, so that water does not remain collected in dams, but reaches the fields.""
  

  

  He also spoke about ""neem-coated urea"", which has ensured that fertiliser remained available to farmers adequately since it has ""eradicated the possibility of misuse for any purpose other than farming""."

  This will be the third consecutive day of electioneering by the Prime Minister in Varanasi.
  

  

  Since Friday, Modi has addressed as many as three public meetings and taken out two processions in open vehicles.
  

  

  The Congress has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission that prior permission had not been sought for Friday's ""roadshow"", taken out hours before a similar show of strength by Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav.
  

  

  The BJP has maintained that these were not ""roadshows"" but ""Jan Sampark yatras"" and there was no breach of model code of conduct as the PM merely waved at the cheering crowds, without uttering a word, on his way to a temple on Friday and the venue of his rally on Sunday.
  

  

  Today's rally appears strategically timed and placed as Modi will deliver his speech when less than a quarter of the day will be left before campaign comes to a close at 5pm.
  

  

  Rohaniya houses Jayapur, the first village to be adopted by the PM under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana.
  

  

  The assembly segment had come into being after the delimitation of constituencies in 2008.It has stuck out like a sore thumb for the BJP in Varanasi, which is otherwise considered a party stronghold.
  

  

  In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Murli Manohar Joshi won the seat for the BJP though the party trailed in Rohaniya behind the candidates of Samajwadi Party, BSP and Apna Dal, one of the reasons why his victory margin remained a slim 18,000 votes.
  

  

  In the 2012 assembly polls, the BJP finished a distant fourth with its candidate securing a paltry 9.67 per cent of votes and forfeiting his deposit.

  Wary of the tricky nature of this assembly segment, the party entered into a tie-up with Apna Dal (AD), just before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.The AD enjoys a following among the Kurmis, who form a major chunk of voters here.
  

  

  AD's Anupriya Patel was the sitting MLA from the seat and she went on to win from Mirzapur in the Lok Sabha polls riding the Modi wave.

  Manipur will see polling in 22 seats across five districts in its second and final phase, where the fate of almost all the big names in the north east state's politics -- including Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, Deputy CM Gaikhangam and human rights activist-turned-politician Irom Chanu Sharmila -- will be decided.
  

  

  In Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister visited temples, held a roadshow and attended a number of public events in the holy city along with several rallies in the region, in the final push by the BJP to reach out to voters ahead of the seventh and last phase.

  The poll in Manipur this time is billed as a major test for the 15-year-old Congress regime which is facing a stiff challenge from the BJP. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who has not been keeping well, did not campaign in the state. The task of spearheading the Congress campaign was left to party vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who addressed a rally in Imphal on February 28.
  

  

  BJP held rallies by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 25 and by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on February 19 in Imphal.

More than half of Rutahan's population is Muslim and the villagers pooled in money to get the boundary wall built around the burial ground.
  

  

  ""Brahmins, OBCs are among those doing farming in our villages. They have been helped the most through the move as they often complained of encroachment of their fields by burials in the kabristan.The argument at times used to take an ugly turn. Now, their fields will not be encroached upon,"" said Jaddupur pradhan Mohd Muslim.
  

  

  In some villages, it was `kabristan' land itself that was encroached upon. "" A big portion of the kabristan's land was encroached upon by OBCs in our village and they do farming on that land. Now, at least the walled area will be protected,"" said one Islamuddin."

  There are five more such outlets with exactly the same name right next to that of Yadav's and one opposite to him. They are run by his nephews or brother. Srivastava's opponents Saurabh Srivastava, from BJP , and Rizwan Ahmad from BSP , had gone to these outlets.

  ""Just like every petha is called Panchhi Petha in Agra, here every lassi comes from one or the other Pehalwan shop,"" says Brijesh. With BHU's intelligentsia around the corner, mahants of temples, and sharp divide on caste including thakurs, dalits, nishads (boatmen) and theosophical socie ties, the Banaras town survives on its endless political talks and gastronomical highs. None of that is complete without a food trail in Varanasi.
  

  

  Be it refreshing paan morsel, zesty kachauri bite, piquant tomato and moong namkeen chaat, sweet langlata (flour recipe) or some bhaang, campaigning is not complete without a halt at the famous local shops that serve these delights. According to political scientists, Vara nasi's food and its purveyors have seamlessly dictated the political campaigns and subsequent victories since 1950.
  

  

  ""We have seen three definite periods of feasts and fares since 1952. The first period from 1952 to 1980 belonged to paan and bhaang when Congressman Kamlapati Tripathi, a Brahmin and SP's Raj Narain chewed paans endlessly in their campaigns and served bhaang on Holi or meetings before elections. From 1980 to 2014, there was kachauri and jalebi as then visiting Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was served these dishes in plenty during her campaigns. Of course, 2014 set a trend for tea as Narendrabhai Modi arrived and his campaign was built on that,"" says Koushal Kumar Mishra, professor in political science, who specialises in modern Indian political systems.
  

  

  ""And, 2017 has brought chaat and lassi to the fore,"" he quips, as he himself bites into his favourite meetha paan."
"No Yadav privileges for Bhadohi villagers, milk prospects in Mumbai","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/no-yadav-privileges-for-bhadohi-villagers-milk-prospects-in-mumbai/articleshow/57488830.cms","BHADOHI: Yadavs of Ashogapur village in Bhadohi have made it big for themselves in Mumbai. Though having lived in the commercial capital for last 25 years, many of them have ceased to be UP voters, they reached their home state for first-hand feel of the elections.
  

  

  ""I moved to Mumbai in 1992. Prior to that I was a carpet weaver like several others in Bhadohi but it was not giving returns so I decided to join others from this village in Mumbai,"" said Sheshmani Yadav. He took a fortnight's break from his dairy business to present during elections in Bhadohi.
  

  

  Ashogapur is one of the 10 gram sabhas in the Amwa nyay panchayat in Bhadohi. Yadavs voters are in majority in all the 10 gram sabhas. Bhulaipur, meanwhile, has 87% Yadav population while Ashogapur has more than 50%. Yadavs have migrated to Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra from all the gram sabhas.
  

  

  ""It was my father Munni Lal Yadav, who first migrated to Maharashtra in 1980s and set up a dairy there since he had the skills. Later, he called my uncle and gradually many from the village followed,"" said Ashogapur pradhan Jilajit Yadav.
  

  

  Some of the Yadavs from Bhadohi have set up dairies in Mumbai, while others have opened shops selling milk and dairy products. But in the process, many like Mangta Prasad Yadav have stopped being voters in Bhadohi.
  

  

  But he said he had no regrets. ""In Ashogapur, Brahmins hold big chunks of land but now, all the land here has been purchased by Yadavs and it's because of our hard work for had we stuck to carpet weaving we would have been starving like other artisans here,"" he said.
  

  

  The village has a lone Ramsanjivan Yadav in the region who is still working as carpet weaver. His sons work in Mumbai and he weaves in his spare time when there is nothing to do in the fields. Yadavs were not carpet weavers traditionally but living with Muslim artisans in the same villages helped them learn the craft.
  

  

  ""Younger people no nothing about the craft,"" he said. Ashogapur has natives into farming. Out of 500 residents of the village, at least 150 are working in dairies in Mumbai, which comes to at least one member per family. ""Yahan ek khoonta lagaane ke liye Brahmin ko ek kilo desi ghee dena padta tha (Yadavs had to pay 1 kg of desi ghee to a Brahmin to tie a cow or a buffalo in his field). But now economics has changed,"" said pradhan.

  Villagers rued that being Yadavs has not brought them any 'sarkari' favours. ""Our village does not have even a single solar light but Dhanapur, a Brahmin village, has been given eight,"" said Phaguram Yadav. The village has only one beneficiary under Ujjwala scheme of the central government.
  

  

  Yadav families in the village have hardly been beneficiaries under the Samajwadi Pension Yojna either. ""This is because the former pradhan of the village was not a Yadav,"" said Mangta Prasad, adding, ""As if this was not enough 'notebandi' hit us hard in Mumbai and our families here. We can draw money from our Jan Dhan accounts.""

  The 12-beegha land alloted for girls' college in the village has been encroached. Girls cycle up to 16kms everyday to go to school after primary education. ""The college is private. I want to study BSc but my family will not be able to fund my education in a private college,"" said class XII student Nandini Yadav who scored 82% marks in UP board in class X.
  

  

  Yadavs in the village said they don't want to come back from Mumbai as the level of development in their village has not changed much compared to what it was two decades ago when migration from the village began."

  Hitting at Modi and BJP leaders for ""misguiding"" people of the state with ""false"" promises and slogans, Akhilesh said, "" It is shocking to see the prime minister presenting false and baseless figures regarding development work, crime and power supply. His claims that the Samajwadi Party's social welfare schemes were discriminatory were false as I have produced names of beneficiaries of Samajwadi pension scheme and free laptops.""
  

  

  He also said that the prime minister had no answer when asked what he or his 73 MPs have done for the state in the last three years.
  

  

  Responding to Governor Ram Naik's query regarding continuance of tainted minister Gayatri Prajapati in the government, the chief minister clarified the government will take action against the minister if he was found guilty and that was the reason he had not been sacked. He hinted there was BJP hand behind the Prajapati issue, saying the party had also raised the Badaun suicides by three girls in the same manner and the allegations were later proved false and baseless.

  In reply to yet another charge levelled against him by the BSP chief Mayawati of leading a lavish lifestyle and using imported stones for construction in his bungalow, Akhilesh Yadav said it was interesting how the BSP chief had learnt from BJP leaders to peep into people's bathrooms and houses. He was referring to Modi's taunt on former prime minister Manmohan Singh of bathing with a rain coat on.
  

  

  Replying to a question related to the outburst of Sadhna Gupta—second wife of former chief of Samajwadi Party and his father Mulayam Singh Yadav—against him, Akhilesh said he had not idea of what she has said as he had just landed after completing his election campaign. Akhilesh had gone to campaign in Ambedkarnagar where polling had been countermanded following death of a BSP candidate and now voting will take place on March 9.

  On the repeated road shows by the prime minister in Varanasi, Akhilesh Yadav commented that everybody knows only weak students appear in re-examination.
  

  

  Taunting at the prime minister's remarks that power outage was such a big problem in the state that there was power cut even when the CM was worshipping at the Kashi Vishwanath temple, Akhilesh said, ""The prime minister had wrong information, because inside the temple during the pouja I had asked for the fan to be turned off before the aarti but mistakenly the light was turned off, causing darkness for a few minutes. The prime minister has, similarly, commented wrongly on so many issues."""

  The seventh and final phase of the high-pitched campaigning saw various issues ranging from local to national relevance being tossed up before the voters, but the ever deteriorating quality of air and water, caused by tonnes of ash generated from thermal power plants, was apparently missing from the political parties' manifestos.
  

  

  Pradushan Mukti Vahini, a social organisation working for the past two years to raise awareness among the locals, claimed they had met a number of political parties to include these issues in their election manifestos but unfortunately none of the leaders bothered to raise them.
  

  

  Its convener Rameshwar Prasad said, ""In January-February, 38 village pradhans sent a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister drawing his attention towards the pollution of air and water, but, we are still waiting for his response"".
  

  

  Jagat Narayan Vishwakarma, who had moved the National Green Tribunal in 2014 over the issue, said that because of the continuous depletion of quality of air and water, the general health of the local population has also seen a decline.
  

  

  ""For generation of thermal power in the region, 3.26 lakh tonne of coal is ignited every day. But out of this, nearly 40 per cent is reduced to ashes and it floats in the air of Sonbhadra, thereby polluting it. Most of the power projects here are operating for the last 20 years,"" Vishwakarma said.

  Thousands of volunteers, including young women are
  campaigning for the alliance+
  , wearing specially designed T-shirts embossed with the slogans 'Phir Sey Akhilesh' and 'UP ko yeh saath pasand hai'.
  

  

  To pick up the volunteers, ground mobilisation started on February 14 while the special ""Chalo Kashi"" campaign was launched online on March 1 where interns interested in working in Varanasi and supporting the RG-AY signed up to campaign for one week, a
  strategist in the Prashant Kishor team+
  said.
  

  

  A form was given out in which people filled up their name, numbers and choice of assembly constituency and were assigned campaign duties which included staging street plays and a door-to-door campaign.
  

  

  The team mobilised the youth in IIT-BHU and other local institutes by speaking about the campaign and the situation in Varanasi.
  

  

  Most of the volunteers are young educated professionals and students from the universities and villages who had voted for Modi three years ago and were ""disappointed"" with his performance and there are many others who are ""impressed"" with Akhilesh Yadav's vision of development and the works undertaken by him in his five years in power, he said.
  

  

  This is one of the many efforts to ensure that young voters also take active part to get a first hand experience of running an election campaign.

  At his rally number 211, his last in this election season, at Kerakat in Jaunpur on Monday at 5 PM, the CM let out a fervent plea: “This is my last rally of this election and my last appeal to you (crowd) is do vote and help me.” Yadav’s real campaign began from February 1, only after he sealed an alliance with the Congress after emerging victorious in the family feud. The state witnessed seven rallies by the UP CM on some days.
  

  

  He covered the constituencies of most SP candidates, combining multiple seats for some rallies. “The CM has done more rallies than any other leader in these elections. He began late, the special rath could not run, still he outran everyone else with his pace,” Sunil Singh Yadav, the party spokesperson who managed the CM’s rallies, told ET. This now rivals 242 rallies done by RJD chief Lalu Prasad and 220 rallies by CM Nitish Kumar during the Bihar polls.
  

  

  In comparison, Congress V-P Rahul Gandhi did only about 40-odd rallies in the state since February, besides three joint roadshows with Akhilesh Yadav. Some SP leaders said Congress could have done more.
  

  

  Nearly 40 rallies were done just by Dimple Yadav. “Her standalone rallies helped SP cover more ground and we found a new and popular star campaigner.

  Earlier, Dimple was to campaign for our women candidates, but later many requests came from men candidates too and she did many more rallies,” an SP leader said.
  

  

  Dimple surprised many with her frontal attacks on the PM, including on the last day when she said she was a soldier’s daughter and was disturbed that BJP was politicising the Army by taking credit of the surgical strikes. On Monday, both Akhilesh and Dimple campaigned separately in Jaunpur, making the CM say in Kerakat that it was hence a “double appeal” by them.
  

  Latest CommentDimple stood by his side and did quite a number of effective meetings. Slowly but surely she is picking up the tricks. Gallant show by Dimple ji. And Ra-Ga also played his bit.Hirak Dutta

  There were some constant themes in the CM’s speeches — like attacking demonetisation, invoking child ‘Khajanchi’ born in a bank queue, justifying the tie-up with the Congress and extolling virtues of schemes like Samajwadi Pension scheme, free laptops, expressways.
  

  

  The UP CM was also quick on his feet to counter PMs actions and words, like on Monday when he mockedPMfeedingacowinVaranasi earlier in the day. “The PM, who used to roam abroad, is now roaming in streets of Varanasi for three days due to cycle’s speed,” Yadav said in his last of the seven rallies on Monday.
  

  

  Realising perhaps that many of his candidates may be facing antiincumbency, Yadav in most speeches reminded the crowd that they were voting not just for the local candidates but also to make him the CM."

  The PM drove to Gadhwaghat Ashram on the banks of Ganga from DLW , where he stayed at night. During his hour-long stay at the ghat, he offered Gau Seva by feeding banana and green fodder to cows. He took the blessings of the ashram head Mahanth Sharananandji. He was welcomed with `rudraksha mala' at the ashram, which is known as a holy place for Yadav and other communities.

  SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress VP Rahul Gandhi have also visited the Ashram. The ashram has more than 2 crore followers from across castes. Later, PM garlanded the statue of Shastri at Shastri Chowk before moving on foot to his parental house situated in a narrow lane.
  

  

  He was received by Sunil Shastri and other family members. During his half-anhour stay in the house he also sat crossed-legged on a mattress on the floor of room and listened to the recital of a song on Shastri's life by local performers. He was also gifted a portrait of the late Prime Minister by the family members. During his visit, local peo ple greeted him with chants of `Modi-Modi' and Shastriji ki dharti par Modiji ka swagat hai'. Some of them also raised political slogan like `NamoNamo ka jaap karo, gathbandhan ko saaf karo'.
  

  

  After paying tributes to Shastri, Modi moved to the helipad in his SUV amid a large gathering of people. From Ramnagar, he flew to Rohaniya assembly constituency in his chopper to address the last election rally."

  According to January lab report of Sankat Mochan Foundation (SMF), which has been conducting these tests on the Ganga water quality along with religious bathing area of Varanasi, the fecal coliform count count has jumped from 4,100 per 100 ml in 2014 to 50,000 per 100 ml in 2017.This is way beyond the permissible limit of 500 per 100 ml. FCC is a dangerous water-borne bacteria that operates in animals and can be a threat to humans too.
  

  

  The head priest (mahant) of Sankat Mochan Temple and president of SMF, Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, who is also a faculty in electronics engineering department at IIT BHU, says, ""When Modiji and I had met in 2013 before Lok Sabha polls, we discussed at length that the Ganga will be our key issue in speeches as well as its cleanliness will be his first big target when elected. But today, ministers like Uma Bharti are making empty promises that she will commit suicide if the Ganga is not cleaned by 2019. No suicide can save this river unless they respect her like their God."" He adds, ""Our organisation had brought it to the notice of then PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1986 and then to Modiji in 2014. The same sewage treatment plant with capacity of 102 MGD works when the total disposal of waste is nearly 376 MGD. Even the new government is not releasing the Rs 49-crore project which we envisioned with American technology.."

  Akhilesh has been asked to explain his remarks by 5 pm of March 7, at the latest.
  

  

  At a poll campaign on Saturday, Akhilesh asked voters to accept money from other parties, but vote for the 'bicycle' symbol of his Samajwadi Party (SP).
  

  

  ""I (have) heard that voters are being given money. My advice to you is to keep the money but vote for the bicycle,"" Akhilesh had said.
  

  

  The BJP then moved the EC over Akhilesh's remarks. UP BJP spokesperson Manoj Mishra said state BJP vice-president JPS Rathore, in a complaint letter sent to the Chief Election Commissioner, accused Akhilesh of violating the model code of conduct.
  

  

  Earlier, the BJP Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was let off with just a rap by the EC when he made a similar remark that he had no problem with people accepting money from other parties to attend their rallies but that they should vote for the BJP.

  The EC wasn't as kind to Delhi CM Kejriwal, though. Kejriwal asked voters in Goa to accept money from other parties, but vote for his AAP. The EC censured him in strong language.
  

  

  ""... I am trying to stop bribery. In fact, the Election Commission should make me its brand ambassador,"" Kejriwal said in a letter in January to chief election commissioner Nasim Zaidi.

But just before the
  seventh phase+
  , he suddenly shifted gear and visited his constituency Varanasi for three days on the trot, holding three ""janata darshan"" events and addressing as many rallies.
  

  

  In all,
  Modi spent over 22 hours in Varanasi+
  in the past three days — a first for any PM — as campaigning ended on March 6 for the seventh and last phase of the polls. Poll watchers surmised that after a slow start, BJP may have gained some ground in the fifth and sixth phases despite relatively low turnouts, and is seeking to strengthen the trend by extensively deploying its star campaigner in the crucial final phase.
  

  

  PM Modi's intense campaigning+
  in Varanasi marks the first time he has held so many roadshows there after taking charge as PM. Apart from the rally on the first day—which was termed as ""janata darshan"" by BJP —and the second and third roadshows between Gadwaghat and Ramnagar area, Modi also offered prayers at the Kaal Bhairav temple for the first time since he became Varanasi's MP.

He led three rallies covering 53 seats in phase 4 and covered 51 seats with the same number of rallies in the fifth phase. The number of seats covered in the sixth phase was only 49, though three rallies were held again.
  

  

  The final phase, comprising only 40 seats, saw a phenomenal rise in Modi's visibility as this time he led five rallies, the maximum in the campaign, besides holding two 'janata darshan' programmes, one roadshow, a meeting with intellectuals, a visit to Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Kaal Bhairav temple, a visit to Gadwaghat and a visit to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri's house at Ramnagar, which SP leader Umakant Yadav said was aimed at votebank politics.

This includes two sharply distinct belts: one is the Gangetic plains dominated by Varanasi and surrounded by Jaunpur, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Bhadohi and parts of Mirzapur districts and the second is the hilly tribal district of Sonbhadra, beyond the plains, around the river Sone and its tributaries. The plains area is typically agrarian, foodgrain and sugarcane the main crops.
  

  

  Everything moves around the ancient city of Varanasi, which draws millions not just for pilgrimage or tourism but also employment seekers from the hinterland. Bhadohi district is India's biggest handknotted carpet-making centre, with an estimated 2.2 million employed in this export-oriented industry. Like the famed weavers of Banarasi sarees in Varanasi, the carpet weavers of Bhadohi and Mirzapur too suffer ill-paying drudgery for products beautiful and costly .
  

  

  Ghazipur was famous for its rose attar and gulab jal (rosewater). Jaunpur is home to several 14-15th century Indo-Iranian mosques and buildings, relics of the Sharqui kingdom. Further south lies UP's second largest district, Sonbhadra, where the Gangetic plain peters out against the Chhota Nagpur plateau.
  

  

  Nearly 36% of the area here is forested although most of it is now ""open forest"" made up of scrub and scattered trees.This panhandle is home to 10 super thermal power stations and dozens of industries attracted by the cheap power. At 11000 MW , these giant plants at Obra, Anpara, Renukoot, Bijpur, Rihandsagar, Singrauli produce about 10% of India's total power. Other major industries include the Hindalco aluminium factory , chemicals, carbon, and cement plants.

  Sonbhadra's industries should have transformed lives of people here that includes 16 tribal groups. While per capita net district domestic product (proxy for income) is higher than other districts in the belt, except Varanasi, and industrial employment is higher, for the mass of people in hamlets across the hills, life has not changed much.
  

  

  Under-5 mortality is 99 in Sonbhadra, higher than the state average of 90. Nearly 68% children are not fully immunised compared to 47% statewide. Clearly , the ultramodern industry in Sonbhadra has had an unequal relationship with the locals, taking their labour and their land for the country's greater good, but giving them virtually nothing.
  

  

  Questions are now being raised about the staggering impact of pollution -air and chemical contamination of water -by these industries.
  

  

  In 2011, a CSE study had found high levels of mercury , fluoride, chromium, lead and arsenic in soil, water, cereals and even nails and hair of people. Infertility , eczema, joint pains, tremors and fits, anxiety , teeth disorders etc.are rife in villages according to several studies and media reports."

This small village in Jaunpur district has produced so may administrative officers that they can run the office of a prime minister or chief minister on their own.
  

  

  Madhopatti village in Jaunpur district, which consists of 75 households, also has an astounding 47 IAS officers. TV channel crews and reporters visit the village now and then. Otherwise, the place hardly gets noticed by anyone particularly the government agencies.
  

  

  Despite such a huge contribution for running the country's administrative ma chinery , the village has hardly been promoted, particularly on the developmental front. The place, which saw a little bit of development in the form of road and electricity in the recent past, otherwise remains a picture of utter neglect though it is situated just 5 km away from the city and about 2 km from the diversion on PratapgarhJaunpur two-way lanes.
  

  

  There is not even a single signboard nor there is any information about the village on the main road.
  

  

  The village also holds a unique record of four brothers being selected for IAS. Vinay Kumar Singh, who cracked civil service in 1955, retired as chief secretary of Bihar. His two brothers, Chatrapal Singh and Ajay Kumar Singh, cleared the exam in 1964.The fourth brother, Shashikant Singh, became IAS in 1968.
  

  

  Chatrapal also served as the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu. Talking about the first civil servant, from Mad hopatti Mustafa Hussain (father of poet Wamiq Jaunpuri), Girish Chandra Singh, a native of Madhopatti, who retired as divisional manager from Delhi Industrial Development Corporation, said, ""He joined the civil services (the then Indian Civil Services, during British India) in 1914. And after Hussain saheb, the next person to clear the exam was Indu Prakash in 1952 and there was no looking back since then and now every youth aspires to join the elite cadre. In fact, at one time, four brothers got selected to the IAS cadre and one of them, Vinay Kumar Singh, retired as chief secretary of Bihar.""
  

  

  Kartikeya Singh, a teacher, said that ""the credit of honing the skill of youngsters goes to Tilak Dhari Singh Post-Graduate Degree College of Jaunpur. Maximum number of IAS officers had pursued their basic studies in this college before opting for IAS and PCS examinations,"" said Girish Chandra Singh, who is the member of executive body of the college started by his ancestors way back in the year 1916. Another village youngster, Mayur Singh, said that the only thing that makes this village different from others is the fact that parents toil hard and encourage their wards to admire villagers who had already become officers.
  

  

  ""It is this feeling, which elders of every household inculcate in their wards, who further work hard. The aspirants compete here with each other and ultimately perform better,"" said Vivek Yadav, a local.

  The Prime Minister was speaking at a rally in Khushipur area of Rohaniya assembly constituency . Mocking the prevalent system in UP , the PM claimed that if one has to get a government job in Uttar Pradesh he has to pay Rs 2 lakh. He cited the example of a girl, who during UP Public Service exam for PCS officers was declared failure in 2015 but when she demanded to see her answer sheet through an RTI application, it was found that she had cleared the exam. ""But after having cleared the written exam, she did not qualify in the interview,"" said the PM and added that jobs were meant for only a select few because of rampant descrimination in recruitment.""This why Central government scrapped interview for Classes III and IV category employees' selection but state government didn't implement the decision,"" said Modi. In what was being see as his last-ditch effort to ensure votes for BJP and its alliance partners in the district a couple of days before polling on March 8--which happens to be International Women's Day--the PM said Centre had launched a scheme through which farmers can exchange their old water pumps with new ones without paying any charges.
  

  

  He went on to recount various schemes the government had offered in the past around three years, including Ujjwala LPG connection scheme and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bi ma Yojna. The PM said while other states had implemented the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojna, the Uttar Pradesh government did not implement the scheme.
  

  

  Targeting SP government on poor law and order, Modi on poor law and order, Modi slammed it for turning the police force into its personal fiefdom. Promisiing to fulfill at least two of his dreams by 2022, the PM said: ""In 2022, I intend to fulfill every Indian's dream to own a house. My other dream is to double farmer earnings by 2022."" Earlier, the PM praised Union minister of state for health Anupriya Patel, who had represented Rohaniya assembly constituency in 2012 before becoming a Lok Sabha member from Mirzapur in 2014.

Samajwadi Party chief and UP CM Akhilesh Yadav has just come back from Ambedkar Nagar after addressing a rally for the by-election to Alapur constituency be held on Thursday and has addressed a press conference in Lucknow. After days of
  hectic campaigning+
  - addressing almost seven rallies a day over a month - Akhilesh settles for a quiet lunch on Tuesday with wife and Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav.
  

  

  Lunch over, he tells TOI that if not for the Prime Minister's
  presence in Varanasi+
  , BJP would have been washed out completely. ""People voting in the last phase are upset with BJP. PM itna prachar na karte toh BJP ka pata bhi nahi lagta. Agar PM ko aage na karte yeh, BJP poori nahi tik paati hamare kaam ke agge (Had they not pushed the Prime Minister to the forefront top campaign, BJP would have got wiped out in the face of the good work we have done).
  

  

  ""A number of central ministers are camping in Varanasi. Cycle ne aisa phansa dia hai sabko ki sanb yahin ghoom rahe hain,"" he says.
  

  

  A day before the ""battle of Banaras"" - with PM's constituency Varanasi going to polls on Wednesday - Akhilesh and Dimple look composed, sitting in the CM's official residence on Kalidas Marg. The signs of a hard campaign regime is evident on their faces but excitement can't be missed as they talk of their campaign.
  

  

  ""This would probably be the first election in Uttar Pradesh that is being fought on a positive note. People have voted for development and this is my biggest achievement,"" says Akhilesh, who wants to keep behind the stormy days that led to the elections.
  

  

  ""It was one week that was really difficult. But things gradually settled down,"" says Dimple, when asked how she weathered the storm that hit the family last year. But, Akhilesh intervenes, says ""yeh sab ab khatam ho gaya hai"" and narrates a story. ""Once Vivekananda asked Ramakrishna to show him god. Ramakrishna pinched him hard and asked, can you see the pain? Dard anubhav kia jaata hai, dikhti nahi hai (You feel pain, you cannot explain or share),"" he says.
  

  

  But it's the campaign that excites the couple. ""He would tell me about his schemes and ask me to talk about them. The Bhojpuri lines I spoke in Azamgarh were suggestions from a member of our team there. It clicked,"" she said.
  

  

  ""Mujhe ek apnapan mahsoos hua (I felt a rare warmth when I addressed rallies). Everybody knows I am not a good orator,"" she laughs. Is Akhilesh a different man when he is out campaigning? ""He is the same at home and outside, always talking about his work,"" she adds.
  

  

  It's work that he loves to talk about too. ""You asked me how I prepared for the elections. The work that I did for Uttar Pradesh was my preparation. Tabhi maine kaha, kaam bolta hai.""

  He says
  involving Dimple was a strategic decision+
  . ""We did not have much time. Getting the cycle symbol and stitching together the coalition with Congress took a lot of time. I could not visit many places and Dimple filled in for me,"" he says.
  

  

  When TOI asks him why he did not take the strong steps earlier, he says: ""Everything depends on time and situation. Koi apne aap plan karke kuch nahi kar sakta, kyunki rajniti mein koi planning nahi hoti hai ... You can plan your work but not the paristhiti. Jab waqt aya toh paristhiti a gayi. Ab kya Karen uske liye?""
  

  

  Just three days ahead of the results, Akhilesh says he has no regrets. ""I have worked very hard and done my best. If I win, I will work harder and raise my bar higher.""
  

  

  His cherished moment remains his meeting with Bill and Melinda Gates and getting AR Rahman to Saifai, his village. ""Kaam chhota kyun bataun?"" he says."

  From purohits to hawkers, all fume at the mention of Namami Gange, the Centre's clean-Ganga mission launched with fanfare in 2014.
  

  

  Sadanand Pandey, a purohit, laments how the odour of effluents, animal and human excreta that disturb him late evenings after the aarti. Effusive in his praise for PM Narendra Modi for the Centre's initiative, he backs the National Green Tribunal (NGT)'s comment last month rapping government agencies for ""only wasting public money"" in the name of Namami Gange project, launched by PM Modi after his election as Varanasi MP.
  

  

  ""A half-measure is full failure. Modi's a man of determination. But the reason we wanted to move from Akhilesh to him has not been convincing. Tourists step back even now from taking a dip in the smelly river,"" says Sadandand.
  

  

  The January lab report by Sankat Mochan Foundation, that's been testing Ganga's water quality and the bathing ghats of Varanasi, found the fecal coliform count (FCC) count had jumped from 41,00 per 100ml in 2014 to 50,000100ml in 2017 -way beyond the permissible limit of 500100 ml.

  ""But, today, minister Uma Bharati is making an empty promise that she will commit suicide if Ganga is not cleaned by 2019.

  Addressing a rally in Mungra Badshahpur assembly of Jaunpur on the last day of campaigning, Rahul alleged the PM Modi did four ""retakes"" to achieve the success that Akhilesh and his roadshow did in Varanasi, but failed to draw crowds even after the fourth attempt. Saying that Kashi has taken a turn for the better, Rahul took a dig at the PM's advancing years and said it was time to give the ageing PM some rest.

  Addressing a rally at Khushipur village in Rohaniya assembly segment, Modi, who has been campaigning in his Lok Sabha constituency for three days, repeated the promise of waiving farmers' loans and restoring professionalism of the police force if BJP comes to power in the state.
  

  

  Describing himself as a person who ""has experienced poverty and therefore wants to improve the lot of the poor"", the PM said his government was aiming at providing houses to every single household in the country by 2022, when the country celebrates 75 years of Independence.
  

  

  Modi began his 45-minute-long speech with a special mention of Apna Dal and Bharatiya Samaj Party, which are fighting 20 of the 403 seats in UP in alliance with the BJP.
  

  

  Apna Dal enjoys a following among Kurmis, the most dominant OBC group after the Yadavs, while Bharatiya Samaj Party is a breakaway group of Bahujan Samaj Party floated by Mayawati's erstwhile loyalist Om Prakash Rajbhar.
  

  

  Stressing that the country's economy heavily depended on the betterment of farmers and improvement in their purchasing power, Modi said his government was also bringing in measures to ensure that incomes of those involved in agriculture doubled by 2022.
  

  

  He also spoke about a scheme whereby five crore poor families in the country were to be given free gas connections by 2019.
  

  

  Coming down heavily on the Akhilesh Yadav government, Modi said that in BJP-ruled states 50-60 per cent farmers were covered under his Pradhan Mantri Phasal Beema Yojana but in UP only 14 per cent agriculturists were benefiting from the crop insurance scheme.
  

  

  Lambasting the SP government in the state for ""nepotism and corruption"" in competitive exams, the Prime Minister said, ""I took the decision to do away with interviews for recruitments at lower levels. This was aimed at curbing malpractices. But Akhilesh Yadav is not willing to take a cue as he wants jobbery to flourish.""
  

  

  Modi said the people of UP ""should beware of both bua and bhateeja"", terms used by Mayawati and Akhilesh to describe each other. He asserted that only BJP could restore law and order in the state where ""women are afraid to go out of their homes unless accompanied by a male member of the family"".
  

  

  The Prime Minister, who returned to New Delhi after the rally, began his day with a visit to Garhwa Ghat ashram - a monastery run by a sect devoted to the Bhakti tradition.
  

  

  Headed by Swami Sharanananda, the sect is said to have a significant following among Yadavs, who have traditionally been SP supporters.
  

  

  From Garhwa Ghat, Modi went to Ramghat, where he paid floral tributes at a statue of Lal Bahadur Shastri and also spent a few minutes at the house where the former Prime Minister had spent his early childhood.
  

  

  Voting for the seventh and final phase will take place on March 8 and declaration of results is scheduled for March 11.
  

  

  Referring to the festival of Holi, which falls on March 13, Modi urged the people of Kashi to cast their votes judiciously so that ""Holi may be celebrated in UP on March 11, two days ahead of schedule"".
  

  

  The PM's speech was, on one occasion, interrupted for a couple of minutes when he was distracted by a number of youths who were heartily chanting ""Modi! Modi!"". The PM asked them to keep quiet and jocularly told camerapersons shooting the rally ""do not focus your lenses on them"".

  Modi spoke at length about his government's pro-poor and pro-farmer initiatives, which included soil health cards which he compared to ""pathological tests advised by physicians before prescribing medicines"".
  

  

  ""We are ensuring that certified, good quality seeds are made available to farmers so that they do not end up buying sub-standard ones from the black market and ruining their own fields. To those farmers whose water pumps have worn away, we are providing new ones free of cost,"" he said.

  The Prime Minister was speaking at a rally in Khushipur area of Rohaniya assembly constituency . Mocking the prevalent system in UP , the PM claimed that if one has to get a government job in Uttar Pradesh he has to pay Rs 2 lakh. He cited the example of a girl, who during UP Public Service exam for PCS officers was declared failure in 2015 but when she demanded to see her answer sheet through an RTI application, it was found that she had cleared the exam. ""But after having cleared the written exam, she did not qualify in the interview,"" said the PM and added that jobs were meant for only a select few because of rampant descrimination in recruitment.""This why Central government scrapped interview for Classes III and IV category employees' selection but state government didn't implement the decision,"" said Modi. In what was being see as his last-ditch effort to ensure votes for BJP and its alliance partners in the district a couple of days before polling on March 8--which happens to be International Women's Day--the PM said Centre had launched a scheme through which farmers can exchange their old water pumps with new ones without paying any charges.
  

  

  He went on to recount various schemes the government had offered in the past around three years, including Ujjwala LPG connection scheme and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bi ma Yojna. The PM said while other states had implemented the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojna, the Uttar Pradesh government did not implement the scheme.
  

  

  Targeting SP government on poor law and order, Modi on poor law and order, Modi slammed it for turning the police force into its personal fiefdom. Promisiing to fulfill at least two of his dreams by 2022, the PM said: ""In 2022, I intend to fulfill every Indian's dream to own a house. My other dream is to double farmer earnings by 2022."" Earlier, the PM praised Union minister of state for health Anupriya Patel, who had represented Rohaniya assembly constituency in 2012 before becoming a Lok Sabha member from Mirzapur in 2014.

But just before the
  seventh phase+
  , he suddenly shifted gear and visited his constituency Varanasi for three days on the trot, holding three ""janata darshan"" events and addressing as many rallies.
  

  

  In all,
  Modi spent over 22 hours in Varanasi+
  in the past three days — a first for any PM — as campaigning ended on March 6 for the seventh and last phase of the polls. Poll watchers surmised that after a slow start, BJP may have gained some ground in the fifth and sixth phases despite relatively low turnouts, and is seeking to strengthen the trend by extensively deploying its star campaigner in the crucial final phase.
  

  

  PM Modi's intense campaigning+
  in Varanasi marks the first time he has held so many roadshows there after taking charge as PM. Apart from the rally on the first day—which was termed as ""janata darshan"" by BJP —and the second and third roadshows between Gadwaghat and Ramnagar area, Modi also offered prayers at the Kaal Bhairav temple for the first time since he became Varanasi's MP.

  In the first phase, the PM addressed three rallies at Meerut, Aligarh and Ghaziabad covering 73 seats, followed by three rallies covering 67 seats in the second phase and another three covering 69 seats in the third phase. He led three rallies covering 53 seats in phase 4 and covered 51 seats with the same number of rallies in the fifth phase. The number of seats covered in the sixth phase was only 49, though three rallies were held again.
  

  

  The final phase, comprising only 40 seats, saw a phenomenal rise in Modi's visibility as this time he led five rallies, the maximum in the campaign, besides holding two 'janata darshan' programmes, one roadshow, a meeting with intellectuals, a visit to Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Kaal Bhairav temple, a visit to Gadwaghat and a visit to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri's house at Ramnagar, which SP leader Umakant Yadav said was aimed at votebank politics.

  The BJP then moved the EC over Akhilesh's remarks. UP BJP spokesperson Manoj Mishra said state BJP vice-president JPS Rathore, in a complaint letter sent to the Chief Election Commissioner, accused Akhilesh of violating the model code of conduct.
  

  

  Earlier, the BJP Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was let off with just a rap by the EC when he made a similar remark that he had no problem with people accepting money from other parties to attend their rallies but that they should vote for the BJP.

  ""... I am trying to stop bribery. In fact, the Election Commission should make me its brand ambassador,"" Kejriwal said in a letter in January to chief election commissioner Nasim Zaidi.

  ""A high-tension lines can't supply power to villages unless there is a properly functioning transformer to transmit electricity. Similarly , even if the Central government allocates money for development, if the state government is unfit then no development can ever take place. Hence just like the fate of a transformer, which is replaced after being burnt, UP's transformer, i.e., SP must be ripped out and BJP must be ushered in,"" said Shah at a public meeting at Robertsganj in Sonbhadra district on the final day of campaigning of assembly polls on Monday . Taking a dig at chief minister Akhilesh Yadav while quoting SP's poll slogan `Kaam Bolta Hai', Shah said, ""Have you seen SP's work speak? Let me present before you the achievements of SP government under its regime, the state has topped the charts in rape, murder, robbery , kidnapping and goonda gardi (lawlessness). Statistics shows that 23 murders and 26 rape cases are reported everyday and only yesterday (Sunday) about 200 m away from a police outpost, Rs. 41cr was looted from a jewellry shop in state capital, Lucknow.

  His rivals, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of SP and his ally Rahul Gandhi of the Congress, have sought to corner the prime minister in the city by carrying out intensive campaign, including taking a big road show.

  He held two back-to-back road shows, addressed four public meetings, visited an influential ashram and offered tributes to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri - all in a span of three days - as he sought votes for his party candidates.
  

  

  The BJP holds three and the Samajwadi Party two of the five seats in the outgoing Assembly but the former is making a determined bid to oust rival parties from Modi's turf.
  

  

  But it has met a formidable challenger in the SP-Congress alliance and a massive road show by Yadav and Gandhi through the heart of the city has sparked some concerns in the saffron camp.

  The BJP has had nearly 25 Union ministers make Varanasi their hub for the final phases before Modi's three-day blitzkrieg of rallies and special visits. The Kashi Vishwanath temple, no stranger to VVIPs, saw Modi drop by for a darshan on Saturday , followed hours later by Congress's Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav with wife Dimple who stopped their ""vikas rath"" mid-way for a darshan.
  

  

  It's been close to two months of an energetic campaign complete with slogans, barbs, bites and unsavoury comments. When elections were announced on January 4, the Samajwadis were embroiled in a nasty family war amid speculation that the party's bicycle symbol may be frozen.But Akhilesh's victory on the family front and SP's unprecedented alliance with Congress changed the narrative. The alliance -with a 31% vote share even during the 2014 Modi wave ahead of the Lok Sabha polls and bolstered by two young faces -emerged a formidable force, making the contest a threecornered thriller.
  

  

  The chemistry between Akhilesh and Rahul made their five roadshows and four joint rallies a huge draw. This apart from their solo shows -Rahul had over 50, Akh ilesh over 230.
  

  

  For the BJP , out of power in UP for 15 years, the results will verily be a mid-term ap praisal of its past two and a half years at the Centre.

  While party chief Amit Shah's booth level manage ment started a year in ad vance, the party gave tickets g o ing deep into caste cal culations. Its thrust on `winnability' forced the party to embrace several turncoats as nominees, sending its cadre into a sulk at places. Mayawati's BSP -smarting after a total wipe out in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections -spotted an op portunity in SP's internal fight and played on the front foot, positioning itself as an alternative for Muslims to de feat BJP . Her core Dalit votes combined with that of 20% Muslims, believes the BSP chief, will enable her party to reach the magic figure of 202.
  

  

  But BSP's Dalit-Muslim equation didn't appear as formidable once the SP-Congress tie-up was in place. This was seen in western UP and Rohilkhand districts: Muslims voted for BSP or the alliance depending on the candidate best placed to defeat BJP.

  The Opposition party also alleged that he was taking ""anti-people"" decisions through the backdoor only to benefit private individuals and dubbed his government as ""Government of India Private Limited"".
  

  

  It also said that the bias against the poor and the middle class is evident in the policies of this government which is privatising health, education and stopping HIV medicines for chidren in a ""conspiracy against the country"".
  

  

  ""Amit Shah ji has told all the party MPs of Uttar Pradesh that if they get less than 2-3 seats, they will be held accountable and action will be taken against them. So I believe the Prime Minister has also been told the same thing and he is responding to Amit Shah ji's threat. He is also scared that he may not win those 2-3 seats from his own constituency,"" party spokesperson Ajoy Kumar told reporters when asked if there was a 'leadership deficit' in the BJP as Modi was camping in Varanasi for days together.
  

  

  ""Modi ji is scared of Amit Shah's statement and is trying to save his pride by camping there,"" he said.
  

  

  He cited four recent announcements to accuse Modi of ""backstabbing"" and ""betrayal"" of the country's common people as such decisions are taken through ""backdoor"" in the din of electioneering.
  

  

  ""In this election season, where people are watching his 'blitz' Modi ji is taking anti-people decisions through back door! Modi ji's new slogan is 'cashless cashless japna, janta ka paisa apna',"" he said.
  

  

  Hitting out at Modi over State Bank of India's decision to impose penalties for non-maintenance of minimum balance in savings bank accounts, Kumar said, ""Modi ji has backstabbed the poor people of this country by levying charges on not maintaining minimum balance in bank accounts.""
  

  

  He also said this is not the first time that the Modi government forced the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to increase third party motor insurance premiums.
  

  

  Pointing toward the waiving of Vijay Mallya's loans worth Rs 1,200 crore, he said, on the one hand Modi is spreading the red carpet for the likes of Mallya and on the other, banks are levying transaction charges.

Although this phase is smallest in size, the caste dynamics and its geography makes it crucial for all the parties.
  

  

  Apart from the PM constituency, the phase also has three Naxal-affected districts — Sonbhadra, Mirzapur and Chandauli.
  

  

  Two constituencies of Sonbhadra — Duddhi and Obra — are the first to be reserved for scheduled tribes. Ghazipur, Jaunpur and Bhadohi are the other districts going to polls in this phase. Tight security has been put in place in these seven districts.
  

  

  Polling will be held between 7 am to 5 pm in all constituencies, except the Duddhi, Robertsganj and Chakia seats, where polling will end at 4 pm. A total of 1.41 crore voters, including 64.76 lakh women, are eligible to exercise their franchise in 14,458 polling booths.

  The presence of a large number of most backward class's castes in the district going to the polls has made small caste-specific parties significant players in the phase. No wonder, BJP is contesting only 32 out of 40 seats and has given four seats each to allies Apana Dal and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, which are popular among Kurmis and Rajbhars respectively.SP is contesting on 31 seats and its ally the Congress is in race for the remaining seats.
  

  

  BSP candidates on the other hand are fighting on all 40 seats. In the 2012 state assembly polls, out of these 40 seats, SP won 23 seats, BSP five, BJP four, Congress three while five seats went to smaller parties like Qaumi Ekta Dal and Independents. QED, led by Mukhtar Ansari, is now part of BSP. His elder brother Sibgatullah Ansari is contesting from Mohammadabad in this phase. Mukhtar and his son Abbas were in fray in the previous phase from Mau and Ghosi respectively
  

  

  In all, 535 candidates are in the fray. While the maximum candidates (24) are from the Varanasi Cantt seat, the minimum number of candidates (six) are contesting from Kerakat (SC).
  

  

  For the last phase, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent three days in Varanasi, where he visited temples, held a roadshow and attended a number of public events."

  ""A number of central ministers are camping in Varanasi. Cycle ne aisa phansa dia hai sabko ki sanb yahin ghoom rahe hain,"" he says.
  

  

  A day before the ""battle of Banaras"" - with PM's constituency Varanasi going to polls on Wednesday - Akhilesh and Dimple look composed, sitting in the CM's official residence on Kalidas Marg. The signs of a hard campaign regime is evident on their faces but excitement can't be missed as they talk of their campaign.
  

  

  ""This would probably be the first election in Uttar Pradesh that is being fought on a positive note. People have voted for development and this is my biggest achievement,"" says Akhilesh, who wants to keep behind the stormy days that led to the elections.
  

  

  ""It was one week that was really difficult. But things gradually settled down,"" says Dimple, when asked how she weathered the storm that hit the family last year. But, Akhilesh intervenes, says ""yeh sab ab khatam ho gaya hai"" and narrates a story. ""Once Vivekananda asked Ramakrishna to show him god. Ramakrishna pinched him hard and asked, can you see the pain? Dard anubhav kia jaata hai, dikhti nahi hai (You feel pain, you cannot explain or share),"" he says.
  

  

  But it's the campaign that excites the couple. ""He would tell me about his schemes and ask me to talk about them. The Bhojpuri lines I spoke in Azamgarh were suggestions from a member of our team there. It clicked,"" she said.
  

  

  ""Mujhe ek apnapan mahsoos hua (I felt a rare warmth when I addressed rallies). Everybody knows I am not a good orator,"" she laughs. Is Akhilesh a different man when he is out campaigning? ""He is the same at home and outside, always talking about his work,"" she adds.
  

  

  It's work that he loves to talk about too. ""You asked me how I prepared for the elections. The work that I did for Uttar Pradesh was my preparation. Tabhi maine kaha, kaam bolta hai.""

"UP phase 7 polls: 7 districts - rich in heritage and crafts, but still on back foot","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/up-phase-7-polls-7-districts-rich-in-heritage-and-crafts-but-still-on-back-foot/articleshow/57505564.cms","The bruising battle for UP's assembly finally ends in the seventh and final phase of polling on March 8 in the state's south-eastern corner. This includes two sharply distinct belts: one is the Gangetic plains dominated by Varanasi and surrounded by Jaunpur, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Bhadohi and parts of Mirzapur districts and the second is the hilly tribal district of Sonbhadra, beyond the plains, around the river Sone and its tributaries. The plains area is typically agrarian, foodgrain and sugarcane the main crops.
  

  

  Everything moves around the ancient city of Varanasi, which draws millions not just for pilgrimage or tourism but also employment seekers from the hinterland. Bhadohi district is India's biggest handknotted carpet-making centre, with an estimated 2.2 million employed in this export-oriented industry. Like the famed weavers of Banarasi sarees in Varanasi, the carpet weavers of Bhadohi and Mirzapur too suffer ill-paying drudgery for products beautiful and costly .
  

  

  Ghazipur was famous for its rose attar and gulab jal (rosewater). Jaunpur is home to several 14-15th century Indo-Iranian mosques and buildings, relics of the Sharqui kingdom. Further south lies UP's second largest district, Sonbhadra, where the Gangetic plain peters out against the Chhota Nagpur plateau.
  

  

  Nearly 36% of the area here is forested although most of it is now ""open forest"" made up of scrub and scattered trees.This panhandle is home to 10 super thermal power stations and dozens of industries attracted by the cheap power. At 11000 MW , these giant plants at Obra, Anpara, Renukoot, Bijpur, Rihandsagar, Singrauli produce about 10% of India's total power. Other major industries include the Hindalco aluminium factory , chemicals, carbon, and cement plants.

  Sonbhadra's industries should have transformed lives of people here that includes 16 tribal groups. While per capita net district domestic product (proxy for income) is higher than other districts in the belt, except Varanasi, and industrial employment is higher, for the mass of people in hamlets across the hills, life has not changed much.
  

  

  Under-5 mortality is 99 in Sonbhadra, higher than the state average of 90. Nearly 68% children are not fully immunised compared to 47% statewide. Clearly , the ultramodern industry in Sonbhadra has had an unequal relationship with the locals, taking their labour and their land for the country's greater good, but giving them virtually nothing.
  

  

  Questions are now being raised about the staggering impact of pollution -air and chemical contamination of water -by these industries.
  

  

  In 2011, a CSE study had found high levels of mercury , fluoride, chromium, lead and arsenic in soil, water, cereals and even nails and hair of people. Infertility , eczema, joint pains, tremors and fits, anxiety , teeth disorders etc.are rife in villages according to several studies and media reports."

This small village in Jaunpur district has produced so may administrative officers that they can run the office of a prime minister or chief minister on their own.
  

  

  Madhopatti village in Jaunpur district, which consists of 75 households, also has an astounding 47 IAS officers. TV channel crews and reporters visit the village now and then. Otherwise, the place hardly gets noticed by anyone particularly the government agencies.
  

  

  Despite such a huge contribution for running the country's administrative ma chinery , the village has hardly been promoted, particularly on the developmental front. The place, which saw a little bit of development in the form of road and electricity in the recent past, otherwise remains a picture of utter neglect though it is situated just 5 km away from the city and about 2 km from the diversion on PratapgarhJaunpur two-way lanes.
  

  

  There is not even a single signboard nor there is any information about the village on the main road.
  

  

  The village also holds a unique record of four brothers being selected for IAS. Vinay Kumar Singh, who cracked civil service in 1955, retired as chief secretary of Bihar. His two brothers, Chatrapal Singh and Ajay Kumar Singh, cleared the exam in 1964.The fourth brother, Shashikant Singh, became IAS in 1968.
  

  

  Chatrapal also served as the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu. Talking about the first civil servant, from Mad hopatti Mustafa Hussain (father of poet Wamiq Jaunpuri), Girish Chandra Singh, a native of Madhopatti, who retired as divisional manager from Delhi Industrial Development Corporation, said, ""He joined the civil services (the then Indian Civil Services, during British India) in 1914. And after Hussain saheb, the next person to clear the exam was Indu Prakash in 1952 and there was no looking back since then and now every youth aspires to join the elite cadre. In fact, at one time, four brothers got selected to the IAS cadre and one of them, Vinay Kumar Singh, retired as chief secretary of Bihar.""
  

  

  Kartikeya Singh, a teacher, said that ""the credit of honing the skill of youngsters goes to Tilak Dhari Singh Post-Graduate Degree College of Jaunpur. Maximum number of IAS officers had pursued their basic studies in this college before opting for IAS and PCS examinations,"" said Girish Chandra Singh, who is the member of executive body of the college started by his ancestors way back in the year 1916. Another village youngster, Mayur Singh, said that the only thing that makes this village different from others is the fact that parents toil hard and encourage their wards to admire villagers who had already become officers.
  

  

  ""It is this feeling, which elders of every household inculcate in their wards, who further work hard. The aspirants compete here with each other and ultimately perform better,"" said Vivek Yadav, a local.

  Despite 47 IAS officers and a sizeable number of PCS officers, the scene in this village is not quite rosy . It lacks basic amenities, including sanitation, health care and educational institutions, because of official apathy .
  

  

  In the name of healthcare facilities, there is only a subcentre in the area, where a nurse provides basic treatment to people. For serious illnesses or injuries, residents have to go to district Hospital, which 10 kilometers away from the village.

  ""Every time they (Muslims) brought a body for burial, there would be an argument over claims that they were burying the body outside the burial grounds,"" said Lalchand Misra of Lachhapur gram sabha. To resolve the situation, a boundary wall was erected around the `kabristan' using gram panchayat funds. More than half of Rutahan's population is Muslim and the villagers pooled in money to get the boundary wall built around the burial ground.

  He was received by Sunil Shastri and other family members. During his half-anhour stay in the house he also sat crossed-legged on a mattress on the floor of room and listened to the recital of a song on Shastri's life by local performers. He was also gifted a portrait of the late Prime Minister by the family members.

  This will be the third consecutive day of electioneering by the Prime Minister in Varanasi.
  

  

  Since Friday, Modi has addressed as many as three public meetings and taken out two processions in open vehicles.
  

  

  The Congress has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission that prior permission had not been sought for Friday's ""roadshow"", taken out hours before a similar show of strength by Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav.
  

  

  The BJP has maintained that these were not ""roadshows"" but ""Jan Sampark yatras"" and there was no breach of model code of conduct as the PM merely waved at the cheering crowds, without uttering a word, on his way to a temple on Friday and the venue of his rally on Sunday.
  

  

  Today's rally appears strategically timed and placed as Modi will deliver his speech when less than a quarter of the day will be left before campaign comes to a close at 5pm.
  

  

  Rohaniya houses Jayapur, the first village to be adopted by the PM under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana.
  

  

  The assembly segment had come into being after the delimitation of constituencies in 2008.It has stuck out like a sore thumb for the BJP in Varanasi, which is otherwise considered a party stronghold.
  

  

  In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Murli Manohar Joshi won the seat for the BJP though the party trailed in Rohaniya behind the candidates of Samajwadi Party, BSP and Apna Dal, one of the reasons why his victory margin remained a slim 18,000 votes.
  

  

  In the 2012 assembly polls, the BJP finished a distant fourth with its candidate securing a paltry 9.67 per cent of votes and forfeiting his deposit.

  The team mobilised the youth in IIT-BHU and other local institutes by speaking about the campaign and the situation in Varanasi.
  

  

  Most of the volunteers are young educated professionals and students from the universities and villages who had voted for Modi three years ago and were ""disappointed"" with his performance and there are many others who are ""impressed"" with Akhilesh Yadav's vision of development and the works undertaken by him in his five years in power, he said.
  

  

  This is one of the many efforts to ensure that young voters also take active part to get a first hand experience of running an election campaign.

  ""Chandrapal (Prajapati's PSO) was arrested near Police Lines here,"" Additional Superintendent of Police (East) Shivram Yadav told PTI.
  

  

  ""We are interrogating Chandrapal and trying to extract information and whereabouts about rest of the minister's accomplices. The police is also conducting raids at locations revealed by the arrested gunner,"" he said.
  

  

  He added Chandrapal will be produced before court tomorrow.
  

  

  ADG (Law and Order) Daljit Chaudhary said efforts have been intensified to track down the minister against whom a non-bailable warrant has been issued.
  

  

  ""UP Police Special Task Force has been roped in to trace the elusive minister,"" he said.
  

  

  The continuance of Prajapati as a minister has raised serious questions of ""constitutional morality and dignity,"" with Governor Ram Naik writing a letter to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, seeking to know if he ""justifies"" having the tainted minister in his Cabinet.
  

  

  Prajapati's passport has already been impounded and a look-out notice issued against him. The UP Police had already asked the Ministry of External Affairs to cancel Prajapati's passport.

  Prajapati was booked on Supreme Court directive and the case pertains to alleged gangrape of a woman and attempt to rape her minor of daughter.
  

  

  Chandrapal, when approached by mediapersons, said, ""False allegations have been levelled against me. I went to Police Lines to voluntarily deposit my service pistol. I was arrested there. I was told my name is there in the FIR.""

  He clarified that he was not absconding or hiding along with the minister. ""I did not even have any telephonic conversation with him (Prajapati),"" he said.
  

  

  Asked whether he was involved in the gangrape, he said, ""The victim is lying. I perform my duty. I was with Prajapati till February 27 and have no clue about him after that day.
  

  

  Earlier in the day, Prajapati failed to get relief from the Supreme Court which expressed unhappiness that its order on lodging of FIR against the SP leader was being given ""political colour""."

  After all, this is the second time the Yadav scion had got his favourite rath made at and moved from Chandigarh to Lucknow.
  

  

  ""I got this rath made from a place near Chandigarh. The best part about the man who makes my raths is that woh jiska bhi rath banate hai, sarkaar usi ki banti hai,"" Akhilesh told TOI. ""I had got this same rath made even in 2012.This time, I got two of them made there"" he adds.
  

  

  Described as such, the rath may conjure up images of mythical heroes astride horse-drawn chariots, but the vehicle on which Akhilesh has set out on his poll conquest is actually a modified Mercedes Benz bus.
  

  

  It contains Bluetooth-enabled devices and a 10-feet hydraulic lift that Akhilesh can use to get a better view of the crowd. It also comes with a dais that can accomodate 15 people.
  

  

  The bus has see-through as well as tinted windows and is even equipped with a bed for resting apart from a dinner table and a toilet.

  The seventh and final phase of the high-pitched campaigning saw various issues ranging from local to national relevance being tossed up before the voters, but the ever deteriorating quality of air and water, caused by tonnes of ash generated from thermal power plants, was apparently missing from the political parties' manifestos.
  

  

  Pradushan Mukti Vahini, a social organisation working for the past two years to raise awareness among the locals, claimed they had met a number of political parties to include these issues in their election manifestos but unfortunately none of the leaders bothered to raise them.
  

  

  Its convener Rameshwar Prasad said, ""In January-February, 38 village pradhans sent a memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister drawing his attention towards the pollution of air and water, but, we are still waiting for his response"".
  

  

  Jagat Narayan Vishwakarma, who had moved the National Green Tribunal in 2014 over the issue, said that because of the continuous depletion of quality of air and water, the general health of the local population has also seen a decline.
  

  

  ""For generation of thermal power in the region, 3.26 lakh tonne of coal is ignited every day. But out of this, nearly 40 per cent is reduced to ashes and it floats in the air of Sonbhadra, thereby polluting it. Most of the power projects here are operating for the last 20 years,"" Vishwakarma said.

  40 seats spread over seven eastern districts, including five in Varanasi, will go to polls on March 8, bringing the curtains down on the two month-long exercise staggered in seven phases.
  

  

  Over the course of three days, the Prime Minister visited temples, held a roadshow and attended a number of public events in the holy city along with several rallies in the region, in the final push by the BJP to reach out to voters.
  

  

  Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi also matched it with their own campaign blitz in the region. Joined by Akhilesh's wife Dimple, the two leaders held a roadshow, hours after Modi arrived in the city and paid obeisance at the Kashi Vishwanath and Kal Bhairav temples with much fanfare.
  

  

  BSP chief Mayawati, who is seeking a fifth term as Chief Minister, also addressed a rally in Rohaniya, around 20km from Varanasi the same day.
  

  

  A galaxy of BJP veterans and Union ministers also made a beeline to Varanasi towards the fag end of electioneering, making the poll atmosphere highly-charged.
  

  

  Leading BJP's campaign from the front, Modi mocked Akhilesh and Rahul as ""delicate"" people incapable of taking hard decisions while pitching himself as a grassroots leader who can bring development to the 'Purvanchal' region and the state.
  

  

  Modi said the SP and the BSP are two sides of the same coin - the former being A (Akhilesh) SP and the latter B (Bahujan) SP.
  

  

  Taking potshots at the Congress over its run of losses in the recent polls, he said one day research would have be done to find out if it ever existed, as it is ""disappearing from everywhere.""
  

  

  During his election rally in Sonbhadra towards the end of the campaign, Akhilesh ridiculed Modi's roadshows saying these were bound to fail like the earlier ones and would lead the PM ""somewhere else"".
  

  

  ""A roadshow was held... it failed. He is doing one more... it too will fail and then again a roadshow will be held... Now he will go somewhere else by doing his roadshow,"" he said at a rally.
  

  

  Rahul, in his address, alleged that Modi has waived loans worth Rs 1.40 lakh crore owed by 50 rich people but refused to write off Rs 50,000 crore due of poor farmers.

  At her rally, Mayawati claimed the people at Modi's roadshow were ""mere spectators"" brought from neighbouring states like Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.
  

  

  She said the joint roadshow by Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi reflected they had ""reconciled to defeat"" and added that prayers being offered at temples and shrines ""will be of no avail"".

  Sadanand Pandey, a purohit, laments how the odour of effluents, animal and human excreta that disturb him late evenings after the aarti. Effusive in his praise for PM Narendra Modi for the Centre's initiative, he backs the National Green Tribunal (NGT)'s comment last month rapping government agencies for ""only wasting public money"" in the name of Namami Gange project, launched by PM Modi after his election as Varanasi MP.
  

  

  ""A half-measure is full failure. Modi's a man of determination. But the reason we wanted to move from Akhilesh to him has not been convincing. Tourists step back even now from taking a dip in the smelly river,"" says Sadandand.

  ""But, today, minister Uma Bharati is making an empty promise that she will commit suicide if Ganga is not cleaned by 2019.

  At his rally number 211, his last in this election season, at Kerakat in Jaunpur on Monday at 5 PM, the CM let out a fervent plea: “This is my last rally of this election and my last appeal to you (crowd) is do vote and help me.” Yadav’s real campaign began from February 1, only after he sealed an alliance with the Congress after emerging victorious in the family feud. The state witnessed seven rallies by the UP CM on some days.
  

  

  He covered the constituencies of most SP candidates, combining multiple seats for some rallies. “The CM has done more rallies than any other leader in these elections. He began late, the special rath could not run, still he outran everyone else with his pace,” Sunil Singh Yadav, the party spokesperson who managed the CM’s rallies, told ET. This now rivals 242 rallies done by RJD chief Lalu Prasad and 220 rallies by CM Nitish Kumar during the Bihar polls.
  

  

  In comparison, Congress V-P Rahul Gandhi did only about 40-odd rallies in the state since February, besides three joint roadshows with Akhilesh Yadav. Some SP leaders said Congress could have done more.
  

  

  Nearly 40 rallies were done just by Dimple Yadav. “Her standalone rallies helped SP cover more ground and we found a new and popular star campaigner.

  Earlier, Dimple was to campaign for our women candidates, but later many requests came from men candidates too and she did many more rallies,” an SP leader said.
  

  

  Dimple surprised many with her frontal attacks on the PM, including on the last day when she said she was a soldier’s daughter and was disturbed that BJP was politicising the Army by taking credit of the surgical strikes. On Monday, both Akhilesh and Dimple campaigned separately in Jaunpur, making the CM say in Kerakat that it was hence a “double appeal” by them.
  

  

  There were some constant themes in the CM’s speeches — like attacking demonetisation, invoking child ‘Khajanchi’ born in a bank queue, justifying the tie-up with the Congress and extolling virtues of schemes like Samajwadi Pension scheme, free laptops, expressways.
  

  

  The UP CM was also quick on his feet to counter PMs actions and words, like on Monday when he mockedPMfeedingacowinVaranasi earlier in the day. “The PM, who used to roam abroad, is now roaming in streets of Varanasi for three days due to cycle’s speed,” Yadav said in his last of the seven rallies on Monday.
  

  

  Realising perhaps that many of his candidates may be facing antiincumbency, Yadav in most speeches reminded the crowd that they were voting not just for the local candidates but also to make him the CM."

  Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Khan mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar and said the high court has sought presence of the senior Samajwadi Party leader before it on Tuesday itself in connection with the case.
  

  

  Sibal told the bench, also comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and SK Kaul, that Khan is willing to appear before the high court after March 11, the day when the ongoing Assembly election process gets over.
  

  

  Sibal also told the apex court that being a minister, Khan is the ex-officio chairman of the UP Jal Nigam and that he has nothing to do with the case.
  

  

  The bench said Khan's plea would be heard on Tuesday at 2pm.

  The high court had ordered issue of the warrant against Khan on a service petition filed by the UP Jal Nigam in 2013.
  

  

  The petition was filed challenging the judgement of the UP Public Services Tribunal in favour of assistant engineer DK Singh, against whom the Jal Nigam had initiated recovery proceedings for financial irregularities.

  ""Just like every petha is called Panchhi Petha in Agra, here every lassi comes from one or the other Pehalwan shop,"" says Brijesh. With BHU's intelligentsia around the corner, mahants of temples, and sharp divide on caste including thakurs, dalits, nishads (boatmen) and theosophical socie ties, the Banaras town survives on its endless political talks and gastronomical highs. None of that is complete without a food trail in Varanasi.
  

  

  Be it refreshing paan morsel, zesty kachauri bite, piquant tomato and moong namkeen chaat, sweet langlata (flour recipe) or some bhaang, campaigning is not complete without a halt at the famous local shops that serve these delights. According to political scientists, Vara nasi's food and its purveyors have seamlessly dictated the political campaigns and subsequent victories since 1950.
  

  

  ""We have seen three definite periods of feasts and fares since 1952. The first period from 1952 to 1980 belonged to paan and bhaang when Congressman Kamlapati Tripathi, a Brahmin and SP's Raj Narain chewed paans endlessly in their campaigns and served bhaang on Holi or meetings before elections. From 1980 to 2014, there was kachauri and jalebi as then visiting Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was served these dishes in plenty during her campaigns.

"Don’t know who misled Akhilesh Yadav, says Mulayam Singh’s second wife","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/dont-know-who-misled-akhilesh-says-msys-second-wife/articleshow/57530273.cms","LUCKNOW: Breaking her silence over the recent family feud within the Yadav clan, Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav's wife Sadhna Gupta on Tuesday said Akhilesh was ""misled"" into taking the steps he took. About allegations that she was behind the rift between Mulayam and Akhilesh, she said the accusations were baseless and won't tolerate such disrespect in future.
  

  

  ""I don't know who misled Akhilesh. He respects Netaji and me a lot. I have had more conversations with him since January 1, than we have had in past five years,"" she said referring to date of party's special convention where Akhilesh was elected as the new SP chief. She said Akhilesh had shifted out of the house but his rooms have been locked and are opened for cleaning only.
  

  

  ""Now he has shifted to his new house, but his place in the house is still there,"" she said talking to a news channel in Lucknow on Tuesday. She expressed hope that the party will win a majority in the elections and Akhilesh will become the chief minister again.
  

  

  Coming a day before the last phase of polling for the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the surprise appearance from Sadhna, who has maintained a conscious distance from the media so far, has created a flutter among the political circles, giving rise to speculations over the timing of the statement.

  ""A lot was said against me when it (family feud) was under way. I have been disrespected in the past but I will not let that happen now,"" she said adding that people who have no standing had levelled charges against her. ""They would not have dared to say what they did, had I been actively involved in political activities of the party,"" she said. Expressing her strong reservations against the manner in which Mulayam was removed from the post of SP chief, Sadhna said irrespective of the reasons and circumstances, nobody should have disrespected him. ""It is he who founded and nurtured the party"".
  

  

  Admitting that she initially had political aspirations but decided to look after the family complying with her husband's desire, she said: ""Netaji ne nahi aane diya, par haan background mein kaam karte rahe"" (Mulayam did not allow me to enter politics, but I contributed my bit behind the scenes). Sadhna said she was no longer interested in politics and will take to social work but wanted to see her son Prateek become a Member of Parliament.
  

  

  ""I feel bad about what has happened in the family, but I don't blame anyone,"" she said adding: ""Woh ek samai tha ...,"" (The time was not on our side) she said adding that on one had thought that Akhilesh will rebel. After the family feud, Akhilesh became the SP national president after replacing Mulayam. After the ""coup"" the election commission of India acknowledged Akhilesh as the SP chief and awarded him the party symbol.
  

  

  Giving a clean chit to Shivpal in the recent battle of supremacy and control over the party Sadha said he should not have been insulted and sidelined. ""He has stood by Netaji all through his life like a younger brother or a son would do,"" she said admitting that the family feud will have its impact on the party's prospects in the elections"

They are rooting for them not because they are fans of the `yuva jodi', but due to the faith that the duo, if win elections, would help them get adequate compensation and rehabilitation package as per the Land Acquisition Act 2013.
  

  

  Kanhar Irrigation Project is located downstream of the confluence of Rivers Pagan and Kanhar, a tributary of river Sone, near Sugawan village in Dudhi, UP's last constituency and one of the two reserved for scheduled tribe, in Sonbhadra district, which has history of Naxalism and shares border with Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhatisgarh and Jharkhand.Its an inter-state project, which proposes around three km long earthen dam and will submerge around 4000 hectare of land, forests, in UP , Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Though the project saw protests in all the three states, it did not become an issue in the ongoing UP elections. As a result, villagers decided to take it forward themselves. ""I sought time to meet Rahul Gandhi on Sunday when he had come to address election rally along with Akhilesh Yadav . Rahul ji not only gave a patient hearing, but also assured that he will do whatever he can to get justice for the family facing displacement threat,"" said Gambheera Prasad, head of the Kankar Bandh Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti, an association formed by locals to oppose construction of the dam. Other villagers, cutting across all castes and faiths, too have com plete faith in the Land Acquisi tion Act 2013, which they said was now their only hope, besides courts. When asked it was the Samajwadi Party government under Akhilesh Yadav which resumed the project, Raju Gond, a local tribal, claimed ""It was not Akhilesh, but his uncle's `karnama'."" Shivpal Yadav as irrigation minister revived the project.

  The revival of the over 40-year-old project was announced on December 5, 2014. Officials then said project though will affect 2000 families, but will provide livelihood, irrigation and drinking water to over 100 villages in the underdeveloped region. They also claimed that adequate compensation had been offered and many are ready to accept.
  

  

  The villagers, however, said only a handful accepted the offer, but majority opposed the project as it will submerge 11 villages completely and partially affect 85. Besides, it will destroy dense forests in the area, hitting livelihood of over 50,000 people. Over 60% population is tribal and remaining 40% comprises Yadavs, Muslims and most backward classes. All are dependent on agriculture and forest produce. Soon after the revival of the project, villagers and activists approached the National Green Tribunal, which stayed the work on December 24, 2014. Their case was based on the Land Acquisition Act 2013, which made environment and social impact study mandatory before initiation of any such project.

  It also allowed assessment of a project in retrospection. However, the work at the site did not stop and in the meantime, Modi government brought land acquisition amendment ordinance. ""We saw that the state government was not listening to us and Centre was diluting the 2013 Act, we decided to hold a massive protest on April 14, 2015, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb BR Ambedkar with the support of All India Union of Forest Working People (AIUFWP), an association fighting for the rights of tribal and Dalits,"" said Sukalo Gond, a tribal leader. According to locals, as they were as sembling at the spot, heavy police was deployed. Some policemen tried to remove protesters through force, leading to a clash. Police cane charged and opened fire, leaving 50 injured, five serious including with gun shot.
  

  

  ""Instead of a big dam, a smaller one or lift canal can provide irrigation and drinking water facility ,"" said Roma Mullic, AIUFWP deputy general secretary , who was not on the spot on April 14, but supported the agitation. ""When Rihand dam was built in the region in 1960s, it was showcased as irrigation project, thousands were displaced from over 100 villagers, but later most of the water was diverted to cement factories and power plants in the district,"" she added."

  Hitting at Modi and BJP leaders for ""misguiding"" people of the state with ""false"" promises and slogans, Akhilesh said, "" It is shocking to see the prime minister presenting false and baseless figures regarding development work, crime and power supply. His claims that the Samajwadi Party's social welfare schemes were discriminatory were false as I have produced names of beneficiaries of Samajwadi pension scheme and free laptops.""
  

  

  He also said that the prime minister had no answer when asked what he or his 73 MPs have done for the state in the last three years.
  

  

  Responding to Governor Ram Naik's query regarding continuance of tainted minister Gayatri Prajapati in the government, the chief minister clarified the government will take action against the minister if he was found guilty and that was the reason he had not been sacked. He hinted there was BJP hand behind the Prajapati issue, saying the party had also raised the Badaun suicides by three girls in the same manner and the allegations were later proved false and baseless.

  In reply to yet another charge levelled against him by the BSP chief Mayawati of leading a lavish lifestyle and using imported stones for construction in his bungalow, Akhilesh Yadav said it was interesting how the BSP chief had learnt from BJP leaders to peep into people's bathrooms and houses. He was referring to Modi's taunt on former prime minister Manmohan Singh of bathing with a rain coat on.
  

  

  Replying to a question related to the outburst of Sadhna Gupta—second wife of former chief of Samajwadi Party and his father Mulayam Singh Yadav—against him, Akhilesh said he had not idea of what she has said as he had just landed after completing his election campaign.

  Taunting at the prime minister's remarks that power outage was such a big problem in the state that there was power cut even when the CM was worshipping at the Kashi Vishwanath temple, Akhilesh said, ""The prime minister had wrong information, because inside the temple during the pouja I had asked for the fan to be turned off before the aarti but mistakenly the light was turned off, causing darkness for a few minutes.

  He is effusive in praises on Modi for at least taking the initiative but doesn't mince words while expressing his concern as the National Greet Tribunal (NGT) only last month rapped the government agencies for ""only wasting public money"" in the name of Namami Gange project which was promised and launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he was elected MP from Vara nasi.

But today, ministers like Uma Bharti are making empty promises that she will commit suicide if the Ganga is not cleaned by 2019. No suicide can save this river unless they respect her like their God."" He adds, ""Our organisation had brought it to the notice of then PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1986 and then to Modiji in 2014.

Local residents still avoid visiting Pashchim Chhor (western end) of Basuka village, the portion dominated by members of Nat community of Muslims.
  

  

  Villagers who had shunned the community for decades, elected Razia Begum, a young Nat woman in her early 30s as Pradhan in 2015. ""The historic movement could not have been achieved without support of Shri Shambu Nath Rai,"" said Razia talking to TOI on phone, adding, ""A lot of families started sending girls to schools. The community is also taking interest in weaving and embroidery."" She was out with her husband Shoaib to campaign for a candidate covering villages off Tarigat-Bara state highway. Razia is an important figure as she has the capability of swinging close to 1,200 Nat and 700 minority votes in her favour.
  

  

  The community is also trying to convince six to eight houses which are still in business, to join the mainstream society. ""But they have been asked to solicit clients outside the village. They travel with troupe to perform (mujra) in other states apart from different districts in eastern UP,"" said a village resident.

  There was a time when people used to visit for entertainment Basuka, which was infamous for nurturing tawayaf (female dancers/courtesans). Women forced their daughters into the trade and the girls grew around tabla, harmonium, ghungroo and ustaad, not knowing who their father was. For an outsider, it was difficult to access the ghetto without knowing a local.
  

  

  Till up to three decades back, a lot of women in Pashchim Chhor made a living as courtesan of well-heeled zamindars. It was an era of mujras. But by late 1980s and early 90s, fed up of constant harassment, many females shifted to Mumbai, Kolkata and other places as bar dancers or sex workers. Immoral trafficking act was amended in 1986 and policemen often landed at their doorstep for money. But things are changing now.
  

  

  Meanwhile, a man with strong views on social issues is meeting 8,500 people in Basuka, Shambu Nath Rai (75) is advocating NOTA. As a youth, Rai led from the front during the JP movement while he worked as advocate in Bihar and ensured Razia's victory in panchayat elections. He would vote for the first time on March 8. ""Parties talk about development but in reality UP election is being fought over religion or caste,"" shared Rai airing his views on existing political scenario.
  

  

  Rai lambasted the sitting MLAs from Mohammadabad assembly segment (BSP's Sibghatullah Ansari) and Zamania assembly segment (SP's O P Singh) for not developing important roads. ""Pregnant women have been forced to abort child due to complications. The road is so bumpy they had miscarriage while going to the hospital,"" said Rai. He feels Supreme Court will take a strong view on the existing political system if significant number of voters will press NOTA. ""And that is why I have decided to vote for the first time,"" he said."

  Earlier, Neera also accused the UPA government of removing his names from the textbooks in schools and college courses.

Though having lived in the commercial capital for last 25 years, many of them have ceased to be UP voters, they reached their home state for first-hand feel of the elections.
  

  

  ""I moved to Mumbai in 1992. Prior to that I was a carpet weaver like several others in Bhadohi but it was not giving returns so I decided to join others from this village in Mumbai,"" said Sheshmani Yadav. He took a fortnight's break from his dairy business to present during elections in Bhadohi.
  

  

  Ashogapur is one of the 10 gram sabhas in the Amwa nyay panchayat in Bhadohi. Yadavs voters are in majority in all the 10 gram sabhas. Bhulaipur, meanwhile, has 87% Yadav population while Ashogapur has more than 50%. Yadavs have migrated to Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra from all the gram sabhas.
  

  

  ""It was my father Munni Lal Yadav, who first migrated to Maharashtra in 1980s and set up a dairy there since he had the skills. Later, he called my uncle and gradually many from the village followed,"" said Ashogapur pradhan Jilajit Yadav.
  

  

  Some of the Yadavs from Bhadohi have set up dairies in Mumbai, while others have opened shops selling milk and dairy products. But in the process, many like Mangta Prasad Yadav have stopped being voters in Bhadohi.
  

  

  But he said he had no regrets. ""In Ashogapur, Brahmins hold big chunks of land but now, all the land here has been purchased by Yadavs and it's because of our hard work for had we stuck to carpet weaving we would have been starving like other artisans here,"" he said.
  

  

  The village has a lone Ramsanjivan Yadav in the region who is still working as carpet weaver. His sons work in Mumbai and he weaves in his spare time when there is nothing to do in the fields. Yadavs were not carpet weavers traditionally but living with Muslim artisans in the same villages helped them learn the craft.
  

  

  ""Younger people no nothing about the craft,"" he said. Ashogapur has natives into farming. Out of 500 residents of the village, at least 150 are working in dairies in Mumbai, which comes to at least one member per family. ""Yahan ek khoonta lagaane ke liye Brahmin ko ek kilo desi ghee dena padta tha (Yadavs had to pay 1 kg of desi ghee to a Brahmin to tie a cow or a buffalo in his field).

""Our village does not have even a single solar light but Dhanapur, a Brahmin village, has been given eight,"" said Phaguram Yadav. The village has only one beneficiary under Ujjwala scheme of the central government.
  

  

  Yadav families in the village have hardly been beneficiaries under the Samajwadi Pension Yojna either.

  ""Please do not do any type of injustice with Akhilesh,"" Shah said sarcastically. ""After all, he has made UP the number one state in the country in terms of murder, loot and crime against women.

The words of this man, who they believe embodies their deity Ghasi Ghanshyam, is final.
  

  

  So, if he tells them to go to the city and see a doctor, the Gonds will. But chances are the ojha will `handle the situation' himself by applying some `divine ash' on the body and prescribing some `magic potion'.
  

  

  One reason why UP's tribal voters, present in small numbers in Mirzapur and Varanasi, opt for the ojha is because the nearest primary health centre in Hallia is about 25km away . The road is strewn with boulders and there is no conveyance. In any case, most Gonds have no money to bear the cost of treatment in Hallia or Mirzapur.
  

  

  As they are wooed by various parties, the 1,500-odd followers of the ojha say they have to vote because it is their `dharma', although they have no idea about the candidates in the fray in their constituency Chhanbe.
  

  

  Some have heard of the big names running UP's election show. Describing PM Narendra Modi, Amarti Devi said, ""woh to budhwa admi hai...baal pakey hain.. muskiyat hai (he the old man with white hair... he smiles).""

  But who is Modi? To this, another woman, Jayapati, says, ""Woh Bharat varsh maa hain kuch... kuch bahut bada (he is something big in Bharat Varsh."" But the women weren't sure where or what `Bharat Varsh' was. The women claimed they hadn't heard of Mulayam and Akhilesh Yadav but some were aware of a party with the `cycle' symbol. ""Akhilesh.. naam suna laagat baa... par ham janit nai ki oo kaun baa (I seem to have heard the name but don't know who he is),"" said Basanti Devi. Some have heard of Indira Gandhi, but don't know her grandson Rahul. About Mayawati, Samudar Devi said, ""Thi hiyan bahut saal bhaye... kaa pata kaha chali gaiyen (she was here many years ago...no idea where she's gone).""
  

  

  All of them knew their MP Anupriya Patel as one who promised to come to a neighbouring village for a meeting but never turned up.

""Neta log sab lariyaat hai... godh lagat hain.. binti karat hain ki ham batan dab dei (Netas roam around, touch our feet, plead to press the button in their favour),"" she added.
  

  

  The issues of these villagers, who live along the Adwya river, fail to find a place in any party's manifesto. "" Approach roads are the biggest issue... there are times when men and women walk overnight to come return from Hallia,"" said Bibhuti Mishra, founder of Prabodhini Foundation, which is working to empower women in the area.
  

  

  ""Most of these people have never seen the world beyond Vindhyanchal Temple. But they are strong people who struggle to suron savings as small as Rs 40-50 per month,"" said Mishra, who's helping these women form a self-help group."

  Now well-off, they've have bought land in their village, something they couldn't have dreamed of had they not left. What they lost, they say , is their right to vote in UP . This poll season, many of the Mumbai Yadavs are back in their village ""for a first-hand feel of the elections"". UP ""I moved to Mumbai in 1992. Before that, I was a carpet weaver like others. But there were no returns. So I joined other villagers in Mumbai,"" says Sheshmani Yadav. Yadavs are in the majority in the 10 gram sabhas, including Ashogapur, in Bhadohi's Amwanyay panchayat. While Bhulaipur has an 87% Yadav population, Ashogapur has over 50%.
  

  

  ""My father Munni Lal migrated to Maharashtra in the 1980s and set up a dairy there. My uncle followed and then many others joined the dairy business across Maharashtra,"" says Ashogapur pradhan Jilajit Yadav. Some set up dairies in Mumbai, others run shops selling milk and dairy products. Many, like Mangta Prasad, fell off the electoral roll over the years. He does not regret that.

  ""It's okay . In Ashogapur, Brahmins used to hold big chunks of land. But now, much of the land's been bought by us Yadavs. Had we stuck to carpet weaving, we'd have been starving like other ar tisans here,"" he says. Yadavs are traditionally not carpet weavers but alongside Muslim artisans in these villages, they learnt the craft. Of the 500 Yadav villagers, at least 150 work in dairies in Mumbai -a member per family .
  

  

  ""Yadavs had to pay a Brah min 1 kg desi ghee to simply tether a cow in his field. But now the game's changed,"" smiles the pradhan. But they rue that they can't avail `sarkari' favours.

  They have barely benefitted from the Samajwadi Pension Yojna either.

  The highlight of the acrimonious campaign for the March 8 polls for 40 seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh was the show of strength by the BJP, the SP-Congress combine and the BSP in PM Narendra Modi's Varanasi constituency where he camped for three days.
  

  

  Manipur will see polling in 22 seats across five districts in its second and final phase, where the fate of almost all the big names in the north east state's politics -- including Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, Deputy CM Gaikhangam and human rights activist-turned-politician Irom Chanu Sharmila -- will be decided.
  

  

  In Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister visited temples, held a roadshow and attended a number of public events in the holy city along with several rallies in the region, in the final push by the BJP to reach out to voters ahead of the seventh and last phase.
  

  

  Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi also matched it with their own campaign blitz in the region. Joined by Akhilesh's wife Dimple, the two leaders held a roadshow, hours after Modi arrived in the city and paid obeisance at the Kashi Vishwanath and Kal Bhairav temples with much fanfare.
  

  

  BSP chief Mayawati, who is seeking a fifth term as Chief Minister, also addressed a rally in Rohaniya, around 20 km from Varanasi the same day.
  

  

  A galaxy of BJP veterans and Union ministers also made a beeline to Varanasi towards the fag end of electioneering, making the poll atmosphere highly charged.
  

  

  The poll in Manipur this time is billed as a major test for the 15-year-old Congress regime which is facing a stiff challenge from the BJP. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who has not been keeping well, did not campaign in the state. The task of spearheading the Congress campaign was left to party vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who addressed a rally in Imphal on February 28.
  

  

  BJP held rallies by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 25 and by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on February 19 in Imphal.

  Sharmila, who fasted for 16 years for repealing the AFSPA from the state, is in the election fray for the first time and is pitted against Ibobi Singh himself in Thoubal constituency.
  

  

  The high-decibel campaign in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa was set rolling after the EC announced polling dates on January 4.
  

  

  In Punjab and Goa polling was held on February 5, while Uttarakhand went to polls on February 15.
  

  

  In Uttar Pradesh polling was announced in seven phases between February 11 and March 8. The EC announced a two-phase exercise for Manipur, the first of which was on March 4.
  

  

  After the final phase of the polling on March 8, all eyes will be riveted on March 11 when results of elections in all five states, dubbed as a litmus test for the Narendra Modi government, will be declared."

  In an interaction with reporters here on Friday , Shah said, ""After ruling for five years, UP CM Akhilesh Yadav asks `When will good days come for UP?' The answer to his question is that good days for UP will come on March 11 at 1pm with BJP coming to power.""
  

  

  Highlighting UP CM's ""helplessness"" by asking ""tainted minister"" Gayatri Prajapati to surrender, Shah said, ""I noticed CM on TV appealing Prajapati to surrender. Those who are in power do not show helplessness in such matters and share responsibility with the police. There is still time before poll results and CM should ensure arrest of Prajapati.If not, BJP after coming into power will ensure immediate arrest of Prajapati.""
  

  

  Shah said that BJP will win with two-thirds majority .""As per information, BJP is ruling the charts in the last five phases and is heading towards victory in the last two phases. I can see that enthusiasm of people is far more than the BJP workers and the storm which was there in 2014 Lok Sabha elections can be seen during assembly elections,"" he said.

  He said frustration of people towards SP-led state government is visible. Later, Shah attacked CM for rising crime and corruption in UP and lack of employment opportunities. He also slammed Mayawati's BSP and said that how can a party with leaders like Afzal Ansari and Mukhtar Ansari promise to ensure a `goonda-mukt' administration.
  

  

  Shah also expressed disappointment over dismal law and order situation in state.He said that despite release of funds worth Rs. 1.70 lakh fo development in state, no work was visible. ""CM should give answers where was the money used,"" said Shah.
  

  

  ""Even villages of highprofile places like Amethi and Rae Bareilly had no power supply . It was only after BJPled government came into power that electrification of such villages was done,"" said Shah.
  

  

  Shah said that an extensive framework pertaining to development of UP had been prepared. ""Infrastructure development of over a thousand crore rupees for east UP and Bundelkhand has been worked out and more schemes are in the offing, including 40 new dairy firms, 80 engineering colleges and over 20 medical colleges."""

  Banarasis looked on as the biggest leaders of political parties crossed each others' path on the banks of Ganga, covering the busy cobbled-up bylanes, between landmarks Banaras Hindu University in Lanka and the Dashashwamedh Ghat.
  

  

  If it was saffron umbrellas and gamchhas, 3-D lifesize posters of Prime minister Modi put up by the BJP, it was a cycle atop vans with cutouts of UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav morphed into a gladiator and of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi.
  

  

  Till 9 am, when steamers and boats were ferrying buoyant Brahmins and boatmen from Nishad community waving lotus and saffron flags, it was clear BJP had run its script with as much elan as it did in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. And all this was long before Modi arrived at noon.
  

  

  'Har har Modi, ghar ghar Modi,' chanted BJP's army as the ensconced themselves in tiny shops, perched on terraces of old homes, electricity poles or parapets of business centres, in a throwback to Modi's debut elections.
  

  

  Though BJP has changed its election discourse with comments on Hindu-Muslim divide including kabrastan and shamshan ghat and discriminatory electric supply on festivals, all eyes there were on Modi's roadshow as it passed through a prominent Muslim ghetto Madanpura, known for its Bunkars (weavers) who stitch Banarsi sarees for years.
  

  

  ""Bahut zyada utsaah nahi tha. Jab Modi ji 2014 mein lade thhe, aur nomination kiya tha. Hum ne bhi unko vote daala tha (There wasn't as much as fervour as when Modi filed nomination in 2014),"" said weaver Kabir, refusing to take the call on who will win the polls.
  

  

  By the time Modi took an about turn outside the Kalbhairo temple, SP's men had stormed the streets. On many occasions, SP's men, sporting 'Akhilesh ki Army' shirts had a direct face-off with BJP's supporters.
  

  

  Despite anti-incumbency, their posse of supporters looked jubilant. They went along distributing sweets, shirts and SP's red caps.

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to select Ghazipur MP Manoj Sinha as Union minister of state for railways has much to do with the special focus for the allotment of new development projects for eastern Uttar Pradesh.
  

  

  The new projects undertaken by railways are expected to connect the BJP with the farmers and poor people in this region.
  

  

  Apart from expansion and beautification works for Manduadih railway station to ease pressure on Varanasi Cantt railway station and introduction of escalator facilities at Manduadih and Ghazipur railway stations, the Centre has sanctioned major projects such as doubling of Mau-Ghazipur-Tarighat new railway line (at a cost of Rs 845 crore), doubling of Varanasi-Madhosingh-Allahabad city railway line (Rs 702 crore), electrification work of Ghazipur-Aurihar-Manduadih-Allahabad (Rs 100 crore), construction of rail overbridge at Manduadih crossing in Varanasi (Rs 42 crore) and electrification of Chapra-Ballia double line (about Rs 200 crore). Work on all these projects is in progress.
  

  

  Ghazipur, Ballia and Mau are among the most backward regions of the state from where people used to migrate to big cities such as Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi by train in search of employment.
  

  

  Railways minister Sinha has introduced a number of trains originating from Ghazipur. For example, Suheldev Express runs between Ghazipur and Anand Vihar terminal in Delhi three days a week.
  

  

  The decision to name the train Suheldev Express clearly indicates BJP's plan to play the ""development with caste, card in this region on the pattern of Bihar, where Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has successfully cultivated the most backward castes as his party's vote bank. Suheldev is projected by Rajbhars as a king and is thus, their icon.
  

  

  Another new train, Shabdabhedi Express, which Sinha has introduced, runs between Ghazipur and Kolkata. Earlier, there was a lack of fast trains connecting Kolkata with Ghazipur and Ballia.
  

  

  Most of the residents of Ballia district had to catching a train from Buxar or Varanasi in the past.

  ""The situation is such that even people from Varanasi who fail to greserved berths in the trains originating or crossing from Varanasi, now prefer to go to Ghazipur to catch Suheldev Express, which passes through Sultanpur-Lucknow-Moradabad railway route,, said Kamlesh Singh, a passenger at Ghazipur railway station.
  

  

  Besides these projects, railways ministry has selected a place near Ghazipur Ghat railway station to construct a cargo centre for perishables.
  

  

  This centre is meant to help the farmers who grow vegetables and fruits in this region. The project is all set to start functioning very soon.
  

  

  Almost all the railway stations which fall in Ghazipur, Ballia and Varanasi have got a new look, with railways ensuring augmentation and upgradation of passenger amenities. These stations include Jakhania, Sadat, Dullahpur, Saidpur Bhitri and Aurihar.
  

  

  In the last two years, the projects which have been completed by railways in PM Narendra Modi's Varanasi Lok Sabha seat include mechanised laundry for cancer hospital, provision of additional entry with cabway and upper class transit lounge, and provision of 120 low-cost shelters for passengers at various stations in Varanasi division."

  The Congress has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission over the ""unauthorised"" roadshow of Modi and urged the SP, its alliance partner for Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, to do likewise.
  

  

  Trouble began around 6.30pm, minutes after a joint roadshow of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and his wife and SP MP Dimple Yadav crossed the Maidagin locality, a stone's throw from the Town Hall.
  

  

  A section of SP workers, who had come out on the streets in large numbers and were walking beside the leaders' vehicle, dispersed and headed towards the Town Hall, surrounded the premises and started raising slogans, sending police and administrative officials in a tizzy.
  

  

  Some of the officials rushed to pacify the agitated SP workers, while others got busy preventing the BJP activists, who had begun to gather to attend the PM's rally, from picking up a quarrel with the other side.
  

  

  The workers of the BJP and the SP had clashed barely two hours ago, while the roadshow of Rahul, Akhilesh and Dimple was crossing the Chukaghat locality.
  

  

  The SP workers raised slogans alleging that Modi was scheduled to simply visit and pay obeisance at two temples but he ended up taking out a roadshow, travelling in an open vehicle, in a virtual show of strength in his parliamentary constituency though no permission had been sought for the same from the administration.

  Meanwhile, a written complaint was lodged by the district unit of the Congress with regard to Modi's roadshow.

  The highest jump of 4.14% was recorded in Gorakhpur—known as stronghold of BJP firebrand MP Yogi Aditya Nath—where voting percentage this time shot from 52.75 in 2012 to 56.89% . In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the district registered 52.47% voting.

  Why did you quit SP after such a long association with Mulayam Singh Yadav?
  

  I have no issue with Netaji (Mulayam) but it was increasingly becoming difficult to survive under Akhilesh Yadav's regime. Some of his aides want to change the principles of SP which veteran leaders like us have always followed. I waited till the final word of Netaji but when he also sided with his son, I had to leave SP.
  

  

  Did Mayawati asked you to BSP or you made the first move?
  

  This is a very private question. In politics we need not necessarily discuss all the details on public forum. But anyway I am happy joining the BSP and all workers here have welcomed me.
  

  

  How difficult it would be for you to work with a totally different set of ideals in BSP?
  

  I still believe in social jus tice and ideals of socialism. I have always been against parties which promote communal forces. I think today BSP is the only party which is working for social justice and equality . My ideals very well fit with BSP's ethics.
  

  

  It is said that you quit SP after being denied ticket?
  

  Let me tell you that I didn't leave party because I was denied ticket. In fact, my name was in the first list released by the party.
  

  

  You always said Mulayam is like a father figure to you.Do you still speak to him?
  

  I have not spoken to him or to anyone in SP af ter leaving the party. Now, Mayawati is my team leader and I follow her in structions.
  

  

  

  
    Neeraj Shekhar, Samajwadi Party
    

  
  

  

  Senior SP leaders like Ambika Chaudhary left the party before elections? Won't that affect SP's performance?
  

  No. SP is going strong because of public support and trust with CM Akhilesh Yadav. Ambika Chaudhary didn't leave on his own but he was expelled from the party because he was pitting family members against each other.

  Ballia is infamous for copying nexus during board exams.Even PM has termed it as a problem of east UP. What's your take?
  

  I am sorry to say but PM often tends to indulge in loose talk which has no research to back it, be it graveyard or calling east UP a ground for cheating nexus. Yes, I accept until a few years ago, massive copying used to take place due to negligence of education authorities. But, of late, things have changed and action is being against fake colleges.

  Lack of clean drinking water in most parts of Ballia is the main problem. I would like to prepare a supply network throughout Ballia to ensure safe drinking water to locals. Also unemployment and lack of industries are other issues that need attention."

  Modi's roadshow that started from Lanka near BHU at 10.45 am- 45 minutes behind schedule- traversed through the narrow lanes of the city with BJP supporters raising slogans like 'Subah Banaras, Shaam Banaras; Modi Tere Naam Banaras' and 'Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi' all through the 4.5-km route till Kal Bhairav temple.
  

  

  Around almost the same time, another area of the city was transforming into a sea of red as Akhilesh and Rahul started their much-anticipated road show from Kutchery Chauraha. Hundreds of supporters wearing the SP's red 'topi' and waving flags and banners bearing symbols of both the parties lined the streets- a little more open than the route taken by the PM's cavalcade- cheering Akhilesh and Rahul with slogans like ""Akhilesh nahin ye aandhi hai, saath mein Rahul Gandhi hai"". Akhilesh's wife and Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav, too, joined the jamboree after a while as it travelled more than 8 km.
  

  

  At a rally in Unchahar, in reply to PM's allegation of discrimination in power supply, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had asked the PM to swear by the Ganga if there was no 24-hour electricity.

  Coining a new acronym, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the BJP stands for ""Bahut Jhoot Paathshala"" with Modi as its principal.
  

  

  ""Modi has lowered the dignity of his office and it was not expected from a Prime Minister that he would stoop so low that he who would indulge in cheap politics and make remarks about graveyards and cremation-ground,"" Surjewala said.
  

  

  Addressing a news conference here, he accused the Prime Minister of ""spreading hatred"" in the society and ""dividing people on religious grounds"".
  

  

  Recalling that PM Modi in a recent rally had accused the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh of discriminating in power supply on religious grounds, saying ""electricity is provided on Ramadan but not on Holi or Diwali"".
  

  

  Lashing out at the PM for ""not doing"" anything to benefit the farmers, he said, ""Modi tells the farmers you leave your crops as when you (farmers) will suffer crop losses then we will give insurance and he provokes countrymen saying when they will die then he will give them insurance.""
  

  

  Surjewala asked, ""Do our farmers need to wait for their crop loss to get insurance and our countrymen need to die to get their insurance from him (Modi)?""
  

  

  He slammed the central government following the steep hike in LPG cylinder prices saying the international crude and gas price were not so high that the government needed to hike the LPG cylinder prices.

  Surjewala also hit out at BJP over ""gender bias"" in Banaras Hindu University (BHU), saying girls do not get the facilities given to boys.
  

  

  Congress leader Pramod Tiwari took a jibe at PM Modi saying the BJP had not declared its chief ministerial face in UP election as ""PM would take the additional charge of UP CM"".
  

  

  He added that Modi ""landed as a superman"" but turned into a ""supertax man"".
  

  

  Taking dig at PM for his jibe at Rahul for coconut remark, he said Modi's English was weak as he could not understand the meaning of pineappale and coconut."

Rahul’s sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will, however, not participate in the event.
  

  

  Though there was speculation that she would be the face of the Congress’ UP campaign, Priyanka just appeared at two rallies in Rae Bareli and reluctantly spoke for about five minutes at one of them.

  When the alliance with the Samajwadi Party was finalised, there were also reports that Priyanka and Dimple would appear together at few events, but it never happened.
  

  

  Congress insiders, however, insisted that Priyanka had played an important role in the UP election campaign by strategising from behind the scenes. “She has been monitoring the election campaign, 24X7, and is in constant touch with campaign strategists and Congress leaders about the messaging, determination of locations of road shows and analysing the response.

   UP elections has seen her maximum involvement this time,” a Congress insider said. The alliance had also planned to allow Akhilesh and Rahul hog all the attention and they were the two faces on the posters. In a few constituencies like Jaunpur, where Nadeem Javed of Congress is contesting, campaign material and hoardings do feature Priyanka and Dimple.
  

  

  An eye injury to her son is also being cited for Priyanka keeping away from active campaigning. “It is over to 2019 now. Priyanka may enter active politics then to contest the Rae Bareli seat if Sonia Gandhi does not wish to contest,” said the Congress insider.
  

  

  Dimple, on the other hand, is in active politics and cannot be compared to Priyanka, the insider said, adding that Congress had never officially announced that Priyanka would be the face of the UP campaign or hold rallies outside the family boroughs of Amethi and Rae Bareli. “The important question is who said so to the media,” the insider said."

The party sees a possibility of maximising gains here, in comparison to the stiff contest it expects in the 40 seats voting in the last phase on March 8.
  

  Watch blockbuster film Bahubali online on Amazon Prime VideoAmazon Prime VideoWondering if you need term insurance?MAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  Targeting 25 to 30 of the 49 seats in this backward region, BJP is wooing non-Jatav Dalit and non-Yadav OBC votes across Maharjaganj, Kushi Nagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia - beyond its traditional Brahmin and Thakur votes.
  

  

  Dalits constitute Mayawati's support base and Jatavs among Dalits considered her core voters. The BJP strategy is to wean away a chunk of the Dalit vote that's traditionally BSP's. It's also to be seen if the non-Yadav OBCs — Kurmi and Santhwar— shift loyalty from Mayawati to BJP.
  

  

  Since this region has the maximum concentration of upper caste voters that's typically voted BJP, the party hopes that it will as always rally in its favour. But in this backward rural area, where agriculture suffers, social indices are poor, and caste rivalries common, whether Brahmins and Thakurs come together for BJP is the big question. With Yogi Adityanath leading the BJP charge in this belt, Brahmins will need to back him for his campaign to bear fruit. This region will also test the Modi government's pro-poor policies, including demonetisation.
  

  

  The region is best suited for BJP's Hindutva brand of politics. Polarisation of voters works best in these regions dominated by the upper castes and a substantive Muslim population."
"SP-Congress and BSP-QED alliance have benefited BJP: Manoj Sinha","http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/assembly-elections/uttar-pradesh/news/sp-congress-and-bsp-qed-alliance-have-benefited-bjp-manoj-sinha/articleshow/57474974.cms","The chopper is about to land on a patch of barren land at
  Deedarganj in Azamgarh, our first stop. Thousands of people wave from below. They are here to meet ""hamare chaheete rail mantri (our dear railway minister)"". That is Manoj Sinha, telecom minister, MoS for railways and Ghazipur MP. Om Prakash Rajbhar, president of the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP), has come along and has made the crowd swell.
  

  

  The two men hit the ground running. Rajbhar is the first to engage and he does that in his inimitable style in warm Bhojpuri. ""Kaa bhaiya! Koi laptop-smartphone milal kaa? (So, people, did anyone of you receive any laptop or smartphone?)""
  

  

  ""Naaahiiii,"" is the response, in perfect unison. That's the cue to go in for the kill. ""Ab piraat ba! (Now it must be hurting)! Ee log revadi bhi cheen-cheen ke baatat hai (These people distribute even sweets after identifying one's caste). Ab ee baar aapan galti dohrai ka naahi (Do not repeat the mistake of electing this party). UP ke Sappu miya aur Dilli ke Pappu miya se bachna ka chahi (Beware of UP's Akhilesh and Delhi's Rahul). Ek se mahtaari pareshan, ek se pita pareshan (The mother is fed up with one, and the father with another).""
  

  

  Soon it's the turn of the BSP to be at the receiving end of Rajbhar's jibes; it, of course, doesn't matter that he was with Mayawati in the last assembly elections. ""Ek bakhat mein haathi peepal ka patta khaat ba, aaj-kal rupiya khaat hai — toh kaha se motaai (There was a time when the elephant used to feed on foliage but these days it is swallowing money — no wonder it is not gaining weight).
  

  

  Aaj Modiji ki leher jo Noida se chali, woh Poorvanchal tak aate-aate tsunami ban chuki hai, jo Sapa-Basapa ko Hind mahasagar ke oo paar jaa phekegi (The Modi wave that emanated from Noida has transformed into a tsunami by the time it hit Poorvanchal; it will wash away the SP and the BSP across the Indian Ocean).""
  

  

  The crowd is by now hysterical, with many recording the speech for after-laughs. Almost half of those gathered sport bright mustard turbans — a sign
  

  of being a follower of Suheldev, a legendary warrior king who stopped the invasion of Mohammed Ghazni's nephew in the region.
  

  

  The main event
  

  The Rajbhars represent one of 17 extreme backward classes in UP and constitute 18% of the population in eastern UP and 2.5% in the country. BJP chief Amit Shah unveiled a statue of Suheldev and launched a book on him in Bahraich district in February. The rail ministry, at the initiative of Sinha, also started the Suheldev Express to send the message far and wide.
  

  

  The SBSP is contesting eight Poorvanchali seats in alliance with the BJP, whose other partner in the state is the Apna Dal faction led by Anupriya Patel, which is fighting in twelve seats. While Rajbhar is in the fray from Zahoorabad in Ghazipur, his son Arvind has staked claim from Bansdih seat in Ballia.
  

  

  It's now time for the main show, and the junior rail mantri gets into the act. ""Aaj kal TV par do hee vigyapan dikhte hai -- Baba Ramdev ka utpaad aur Akhilesh ki sarkar (These days only two ads are visible on television: one of Ramdev's products and another of Akhilesh's government).
  

  

  Vigyapan jaisa sukhi-sampann kisan aap mein se kisi ne dekha hai? Maine ab tak ki beeso sabhao mein ek aesa chehra nahi dekha (Has anyone of you seen such prosperous farmers like in the ad in real life; at least I haven't in the scores of rallies I have attended)."" If anyone does, he declares he will quit politics and serve Akhilesh for life. The gallery erupts.
  

  

  The junior rail mantri's next station is Lucknow Metro. ""The credit for starting the world's first invisible metro goes to Akhilesh."" The rally by now resembles a comedy club.
  

  

  The crowd is swelling and Sinha is elated. ""This is the same venue that Akhilesh visited yesterday -- the crowd today is more than one and a half times, I have been told,"" he tells ET Magazine, pointing towards Nizamabad, our second stop in Azamgarh.
  

  

  After the by-now-familiar Rajbhar hijinks, Sinha invokes Kalyan Singh. ""Remember what he used to say: begunah to chhedo matt aur gunehgar ko chhodo matt (Do not touch the innocent and do not let go the culprit).""

  Eastern UP's 49 assembly went to the polls yesterday. The last phase of 40 seats will be contested onMarch 8. The belt is also home to the Quami Ekta Dal (QED), led by the jailed Mukhtar Ansari. The QED merged with the BSP last month.
  

  

  Sinha's next stop is Mohammedabad in Ghazipur to campaign for Alka Rai, the widow of slain BJP legislator Krishnanand Rai. Ansari, the prime accused in the murder, is fighting for Mau Sadar constituency from jail.
  

  

  Sinha corners the Ansari brothers (the others being Afzal and BSP candidate from Mohammedabad Sibgatullah). Sinha says the beneficiary of the BSP-QED alliance -- as well as the SP-Congress tie-up -- is the BJP. ""The Muslim vote will now split between the SP and the BSP, in effect giving us the advantage,"" Sinha tells ET Magazine, just before the chopper is about to land at the day's last stop at Zamania in Ghazipur.
  

  

  Sinha is a Bhumihar, the community that represents 8% of Poorvanchal; he knows the importance of OBCs as well. Today, non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits are also with us.""
  

  

  As the whirlwind tour comes to an end, it's time to fly back to Babatpur airport in Varanasi. Sinha sits back and declares the party is going to win in all the six seats of Ghazipur. It's been a long day. The days leading up to March 11 may be even longer."

Fielded by Bharatiya Janata Party, the candidate Ratnakar Mishra is no less than the party's chief priest.
  

  

  Having performed religious ceremonies for all top guns in BJP, from Lal Krishna Advani to Amit Shah, 58-year-old Mishra is said to have performed special pujas for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure his victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. His importance in the party is evident from the fact that he was a special invitee at the PM's swearing in ceremony.
  

  

  The Vidhan Sabha ticket is a return gift from the 'jajmaan' (clients) including home minister Rajnath Singh, Uma Bharati and Amit Shah. Locals feel his presence and popularity in the RSS paid off. ""I have been associated with the shakha since 1977,"" said Mishra.
  

  

  But the fifth generation Brahmin panda claimed he entered poll waters for the sake of Mirzapur. ""Vindhyachal is the core of all positive energies in the world but it doesn't seem to benefit from it. Mirzapur has lagged behind badly in the race for development because of regional parties' indifference. I promise to give the city its long pending due,"" Mishra told TOI.
  

  

  He claimed he had readied a roadmap for Mirzapur's development. ""The roads in the city are in a bad state which affects public life and leaves a bad impression on the tourists. Given a chance, I shall get new roads built. Completion of the Bhitauli bridge and revival of the brass industry subsequent priorities. I shall also try to get Vindhyachal an official tourist destination status,"" he said.

  Mishra has been challenged by sitting Samajwadi Party MLA Kailash Chaurasia and BSP's Parvez Khan. Locals feel there is a triangular fight on the seat.
  

  

  ""Ratnakar may have to face difficulties from enemies within the party. Actually, the name of BJP candidate Manoj Jaiswal who lost in 2012 Vidhan Sabha polls was doing the rounds before the official announcement for Mishra came in. So, some workers are demoralised. Besides, he is a first-timer,"" said Shubh Kumar, a school teacher.
  

  

  Kailash is known for his people's connect despite strong anti-incumbency. Parvez Khan, popular for his clean image, may upset caste-religion equations on the seat which can make things difficult for Mishra. As per district election office, there are 3.35 lakh voters on the Sadar seat.
  

  

  In 2012, SP won the constituency by 22,299 votes during assembly elections. Chaurasiya from SP bagged 69,099 votes followed by Rang Nath Mishra of BSP who got 46,800 votes. The voter turnout was 56.48%."

  This seems to be the case especially in the constituencies where the Samajwadi Party or Bahujan Samaj Party have fielded strong candidates from upper castes.
  

  

   SP and BSP have over time succeeded in weaning away chunks of Thakur and Brahmin supporters respectively from the BJP, which has remained a weak political force in eastern UP for the past two decades BSP’s attempts at forging a Dalit-Brahmin combination were highly successful in the 2007 assembly polls.
  

  

  SP, on the other hand, continues to enjoy support among Thakurs in this region.
  

  

  BJP hopes to gain from what appears to be a triangular contest for most of the 89 seats going to the polls in the sixth and seventh phases of the election on March 4 and March 8.
  

  

  Its alliance with Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP), which has a strong support base among the OBC Rajbhar community in this region, is expected to widen its catchment area. Besides, it is seeking to gain from potential anti-incumbency against the SP government.
  

  

  In this election, BSP has fielded upper caste candidates in several constituencies of eastern UP including Azamgarh’s Sagari and Atraulia, Ghazipur’s Jangipur and Zamania, Ballia’s Rasara and Sadar, and Mau’s Madhuban.
  

  

  SP has a few sitting MLAs from upper castes in this region. A prime example is former minister Om Prakash Singh, considered to be SP’s Thakur face in eastern UP, who is working hard to retain support of upper castes in his Zamania seat of Ghazipur. Here BJP has fielded Sunita Parikshit, who hails from the Thakur dominated Gahmar village.

  “This village has more than 10,000 votes and thus, it is a difficult task for Om Prakash Singh to keep the BJP candidate from making a dent into his own vote bank. This village has a good population of serving and retired army men,” said Ashish, a native of Ghazipur’s Medanipur village.
  

  

  SP’s Sanatan Pandey and BSP’s sitting MLA Umashankar Singh are facing a similar challenge in Rasara seat of Ballia district.

  A section of upper castes had supported BSP in the last assembly election. With Rajbhar voters showing open support to BJP in this area, BJP’s candidate Ram Iqbal Singh is expected to bag upper castes’ votes in Rasara.
  

  

  In Bansdih in Ballia, however, BJP appears to be finding it difficult to get the upper castes’ votes transferred to its alliance partner SBSP’s candidate Arvind Rajbhar.
  

  

  The presence of BJP rebel Ketki Singh as an independent candidate has put a question mark on the BJP’s potential to get the upper caste voters to support the SBSP candidate."

  However, a top police official dismissed as ""baseless"" the allegations levelled by the party and said the administration was acting in an ""impartial"" and ""non-partisan"" manner.
  

  

  BJP spokesman Shrikant Sharma said, ""The entire city is dotted with posters and banners put up by the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state and its ally, the Congress.
  

  

  ""However, we have observed that the district administration has been selectively pulling down those put up by our party, especially the ones featuring the Prime Minister Modi who is in the city"", he charged

  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived in his Lok Sabha constituency this morning, is scheduled to address his first public meeting here, for the assembly polls, in the evening.
  

  

  Sharma said, ""What is, however, shocking is that the administration is acting in such a partisan manner. The administrative machinery, once the model code of conduct is in place, becomes answerable to the Election Commission and no other authority.
  

  

  ""But the culture of serving political masters has become deeply ingrained in the state's bureaucracy. All that will change by March 11, though when results will be out and the BJP will get an absolute majority and form the next government, paving way for restoring rule of law in the state"", Sharma added.
  

  

  Dismissing the allegations levelled by Sharma, Inspector General of Police, Varanasi zone, N Ravinder told PTI over phone, ""The allegation (of BJP posters and banners being selectively pulled down) are baseless.

  Several SPSB nominees are in the fray in constituencies of some mighty rivals.
  

  

  So, if Om Prakash is NDA candidate from Jahurabad, his son, Arvind Rajbhar, is fi ghting against Akhilesh Yadav loyalist Ram Gobind Choudhary in Bansdih, Ballia. His brother-in-law, Mahendra Rajbhar, is up against BSP strongman Mukhtar Ansari in Mau.

Two-time MLA and the BSP nominee here, Kalicharan Rajbhar, says Om Prakash is obsessed more with family than the community. Om Prakash's own fate in Jahurabad may hang in balance but his community — followers of 11th century king maharaja Suheldev — is strongly rallying behind BJP. Suheldev, a warrior king, wielded influence around Bahraich and is revered by both Rajbhars and Pasis. Much before allying with the SBSP, BJP had started wooing Pasis and Rajbhars, resurrecting Suheldev as an icon. His picture was put up at the spruced up BJP state headquarters.
  

  

  Last February, Amit Shah unveiled a Suheldev statue in Bahariach and released a book on him. The BJP chief called Suheldev a national hero. Later, the government launched the Suheldev Express, a superfast train from Ghazipur to Anand Vihar. And then came the alliance with Rajbhar's party."

But it was not to be.
  

  

  The Varanasi administration has heaved a sigh of relief that the leaders, who have mocked each other throughout the campaign, will not cross each other’s paths at the holy city’s busiest intersection as they might have as per their original schedules.
  

  

  With the PM on Friday changing his plan, this unprecedented security nightmare will be avoided, people familiar with the matter told ET. Earlier, both sides had proposed to cross the chowk at about 5:30 pm on Saturday evening, sending the administration into a tizzy.
  

  

  Yadav and Gandhi are due to hold a road show from 1pm to 7 pm on Saturday, two days before campaigning ends, and are expected to reach the chowk with about one lakh people in tow.
  

  

  The PM’s cavalcade, as per the original proposal of BJP to the district administration, was to start from BHU at 4:30 pm to reach Kashi Vishwanath temple at 6 pm, raising the possibility that it might have reached Godowlia Chowk at the same time as the Yadav-Gandhi duo.
  

  

  As per the PM’s revised plan, though, he will now land in Varanasi earlier in the day and proceed from BHU helipad at 9 am to Kashi Vishwanath temple.
  

  

  “We had to turn left from Godowlia Chowk and Modi’s cavalcade had to turn right,” a Congress leader said.
  

  

  One road from the chowk branches to the temple while another leads to Dashashwamedh Ghat.
  

  

  In view of the PM’s plan, the district administration had on Thursday approved the Yadav-Gandhi roadshow with one condition – that they must cross the Godowlia Chowk before 5 pm and proceed to the roadshow’s last point, Girjaghar Chowk, where they will be holding a public meeting. That would have ensured the chowk was clear of crowd when the PM’s cavalcade was to pass from here.
  

  

  However, now the PM has decided to visit Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples earlier in the day.
  

  

  BJP leaders said Modi is not doing a roadshow and will travel in his car from BHU to Kashi Vishwanath temple and then to Kaal Bhairav temple. Even so, two hours have been kept for the 8 KM journey from BHU to Kashi Vishwanath temple and Modi “may acknowledge or interact” with the crowd that is expected to gather along the route through areas such as Ravidas Gate, Lanka and Assi.
  

  

  JAN DARSHAN
  

  Instead of going first to Jaunpur for a 2 pm rally and then coming to Varanasi for the temple visits, as proposed earlier, Modi will now go to Jaunpur after his twin temple visits and return to Varanasi around 5 pm for a “jan darshan (public appearance)” at a rally in townhall.
  

  

  This ensures the paths of the political adversaries will not cross. “The earlier proposal was pending with the PM for many days. We already had requisite permissions for it. PM has now desired that he will start his day with the temple visits, go to Jaunpur and return to Varanasi for townhall rally. He wants it this way,” said a BJP leader said, who did not wish to be identified.

  Samajwadi Party’s Varanasi district president and MLC Rajesh Yadav, however, told ET that “undue pressure was put on the Varanasi administration from the Prime Minister’s Office in Delhi to impact our roadshow”. He said he had applied on February 25 for permission for the Yadav-Gandhi roadshow on March 6, the last day of campaigning.
  

  

  “But we were told BJP president Amit Shah had already been given for a permission for a roadshow for that day. We then asked for permission for a roadshow on March 4 from 1pm to 10 pm,” he said.

  BJP had on February 28 night sought permission for Modi’s visits to the two temples between 4:30 pm and 7 pm on March 4. That was when the district administration realised that the Godowlia Chowk could turn into a meeting point for the two sides and it asked the SPCongress side to clear the chowk before 5 pm and end the road show at 7 pm at another crossing.
  

  

  “Why should we have done that? When we had permission till 7 pm, why should we have passed Godowlia Chowk by 5 pm?”Yadav said. “Is a CM less important than a PM? We would have crossed the spot only at our own pace. Good that BJP has changed its programme.”
  

  

  As planned earlier, Modi is scheduled to return to Delhi from Varanasi on the night of March 4 and go back to Varanasi the next day to stay for two days, hold two more rallies and go to the Gadwaghat Math."

  Modi was addressing a campaign rally in Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, after an hours-long roadshow that started this morning in
  Varanasi which goes to the polls on March 8+
  , in what will be the last phase of the Assembly elections in the state.
  

  

  The PM criticised UP's Akhilesh Yadav government for paying scant attention to the safety of women. To prove his point he referred to a former SP minister
  Gayatri Prajapati who's accused of rape
  and
  has gone into hiding

  ""But, a girl is crying for justice and the police and chief minister are sleeping...Such a government needs to be punished,"" he added.
  

  

  Modi's buffalo remark was in the context of the Uttar Pradesh police running from pillar to post to
  track down the milch animals of state minister Azam Khan+
  which were stolen.
  

  

  The PM also slammed the ""political opportunism"" of those who ""question the army and the surgical strikes"" in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir last year and called them ""shameless"" for ""politicizing national security.""
  

  

  Modi said only the BJP really cares for the Army. The previous UPA government, he said, allocated only Rs 500 crores for the One Rank One Pension (OROP) scheme for Army veterans. ""Imagine our surprise when we came to power and saw that OROP was massively underfunded. We allocated Rs 1200 crores for it,"" Modi said, adding that his government was also swift in imp

  The Prime Minister also used the opportunity to talk about ""the success of"" the note ban.He said the opposition parties criticized it because they are corrupt.
  

  

  ""The note ban was criticized by the SP, the BSP and the Congress. All three, Buaji (auntie), bhatija (nephew) and bhatija's friend, got uncomfortable,"" he said, referring to BSP chief Mayawati,SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, respectively. The SP and the Congress are, of course

  In fact, the PM's statements about those who question the army, was also likely a comment on the controversy about ""nationalism"" that has roiled public sentiment over the last 10 days. Almost all the BJP leaders who commented on the controversy criticized a
  young Delhi University student+
  for saying ""Pakistan didn't kill my father, war did"". They called her ""unpatriotic"".
  

  

  Modi had thus far refrained from commenting about it, and didn't do so directly today either, but the context seemed to be apparent. ""It neither is India's misfortune that people in politics lose humanity and commit such sins that neither time will forgive them nor people,"" he said, referring to people who questioned the surgical strikes."

  He also paid obeisance at two temples.
  

  

  The prime minister's road-show was scheduled on a day when 49 constituencies went to the polls in the sixth phase of the state Assembly election. BJP leaders believe that the hours-long event, broadcast live on most of the regional TV news channels, will help their cause when the 40 remaining seats go to the polls in the final phase on March 8.
  

  

  The roadshow started from the Banaras Hindu University after Modi paid tributes to the statue of noted Hindutva ideologue Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya there.
  

  

  People turned out in large numbers as the prime minister's cavalcade moved at a snail's pace. 'Subah Banaras, sham Banaras; Modi tere naam Banaras' and 'Modi, Modi' slogans were raised by the supporters as he waved at them.
  

  

  Modi later offered prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples, two foremost Hindu holy places in the ancient city.

  The BJP, which is locked in a tight electoral battle in Uttar Pradesh with the SP-Congress alliance and the Mayawati-led BSP, hopes that a good performance in the eastern parts of the state will take it past the majority mark in the 403-member state Assembly.
  

  

  The only other time Modi held a road-show here was in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha polls after he picked Varanasi as one of his seats. The BJP swept the 2014 polls in Uttar Pradesh, winning 73 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats, along with its ally Apna Dal.

  Three years later, the saffron camp is once again relying heavily on Modi to deliver the goods in Uttar Pradesh where it has been out of power for 15 years. It has organised many more public meetings of the prime minister than was anticipated earlier.
  

  

  Quite a few public events of Modi are lined up in the region tomorrow and the day after, the final day of campaigning for the seventh and last phase of polling on March 8.
  

  

  Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi are also holding a road-show in the city. BSP chief Mayawati too addressed a public rally at Rohaniya, around 20 kms from Varanasi."

  The Samajwadi president's remarks were a reference to the infamous Juicegate episode, when the Prime Minister pointed out to Rahul Gandhi that coconuts contain water and not juice. The Congress
  denied that Rahul had ever mentioned the words 'coconut juice'+

  Then, Akhilesh invoked the Ganges and claimed PM Modi's lies would not be forgiven by 'Ganga Maiyya'.
  

  

  Addressing a crowd of supporters after an
  hours-long roadshow through the narrow lanes of Varanasi+
  , the UP chief minister said, ""The BJP is spreading lies, while we're talking about development, and giving laptops to students.""
  

  

  Continuing in a similar vein, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi too attacked the Prime Minister for his 'false promises'.
  

  

  ""Modi promised solar lights, free internet and four-lane roads. He promised to clean the Ganga and Kashi. Has any of this happened? No, he hasn't fulfilled even a single promise,"" Rahul railed.

  The two leaders also made sure to apostrophize the success of the SP-Congress alliance's show of strength in Varanasi.
  

  

  ""There were two roadshows in this city today, and you gave PM Modi the answer without saying a word,"" Rahul said.
  

  

  Thanking the people for their unstinting support, Akhilesh added, ""This was a historic roadshow. But this roadshow will be successful only when SP wins all the seats from this region.""

  Pandey's family in Ballia complains that whatever development work is being done in his name is skewed towards Nagwa village — known for being his birthplace — while his actual family is deprived of all facilities just because it is living a few kilometres away, in an old, dilapidated house in Bandhu Chak village, about 8km away from Ballia Nagar.
  

  United Bag Travelon Spacious Small Travel Bag  - Large GreenShopcluesLet's understand the need for a term planMAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  A water tank was built around 15 years ago in the freedom fi ghter's memory in Nagwa by a neta. However, he apparently missed the fact that Pandey's immediate family lived 2km away from Nagwa and hence wouldn't receive any water from the tank. His family complains that because Pandey is associated with Nagwa, most funds and development works are purposely directed to Nagwa.
  

  

  Though the tank's supply reaches about 10,000 people daily, Pandey's immediate family is deprived of it and has to depend on handpumps for water. Pandey's fourth generation daughter-in-law, Tettri Devi, says, ""The pipeline ends barely 100m away from our house. Politicians often refer to Ballia as the hometown of Mangal Pandey and use his name in speeches to gain public support, but fail to acknowledge his family's grievances. We are living in extreme poverty with no government help ever.""
  

  

  This confusion emerged many decades ago when Ganga engulfed the original Nagwa during fl oods and villagers had to relocate to surrounding areas. Santosh K Pandey, one of Mangal Pandey's great grandsons, recalls, ""Villagers settled in different parts within a 3km periphery. These settlements gradually took shape of villages and four villages were formed from one Nagwa village (Nagwa, Mohan Chhapra, Saurban Dada Ka Chapra and Bandhu Chak).""
  

  

  Rajiv Prakash Pandey, a local, says, ""A government inter college, a martyr's memorial, a library and, very recently, a girls' inter college has been opened in Nagwa but our village is still struggling for basic facilities like roads, water and a primary school. Just because we settled a few kilometres away doesn't mean we are not entitled to facilities being provided in Mangal Pandey's name."""

  ""The polling was about 13 per cent till 10 am. It's going on peacefully,"" office of UP Chief Electoral Officer said here.
  

  

  The Assembly segments of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency, represented by firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, and Mau, where jailed gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari is in fray, also figure in this penultimate phase of polling.
  

  

  This phase will also cover some districts bordering Nepal.
  

  

  Around 1.72 crore voters, including 94.60 lakh men and 77.84 lakh women, are eligible to cast their votes in this round to decide the fate of 635 candidates, including 63 women.
  

  

  The districts where polling is going on in the sixth phase are Mau, Gorakhpur, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Deoria, Azamgarh and Ballia.
  

  

  Azamgarh Lok Sabha constituency has 10 Assembly seats of which the SP had won nine in 2012 but this time party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav has not addressed a single meeting in his parliamentary constituency.
  

  

  The prestige of Adityanath and Union minister Kalraj Mishra, who represents Deoria in the Lok Sabha, is also at stake.
  

  

  The BJP is contesting 45 seats and its ally, the Apna Dal, one. Another BJP partner, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, is contesting three seats. While the BSP has fielded candidates on all the 49 seats, the SP is contesting 40 seats and the Congress nine under an alliance.
  

  

  Prominent candidates in this phase include BSP turncoat Swami Prasad Maurya from Padrauna (Kushinagar), former BJP state president Surya Pratap Shahi from Pathardeva (Deoria), Shyam Bahadur Yadav (SP), son of former Governor Ram Naresh Yadav from Fulpur Pawai (Azamgarh) and SP turncoats Ambika Chowhdury and Narad Rai who are contesting on BSP ticket from Fefna (Ballia) and Ballia Sadar.
  

  

  Mukhtar is contesting from Mau and his son Abbas is in fray from adjoining Ghosi seat in Mau district. In the 2012 Assembly polls, of the 49 seats, 27 were won by the SP, 9 by the BSP, 7 by the BJP, 4 by the Congress and 2 by others.
  

  

  There will be 17,926 polling booths and 10,820 polling centres in this phase.

  The incumbent SP, which won 27 seats, and its new alliance partner, Congress, which had won four seats in 2012 elections, is battling the impact of pre-poll feud within the party.
  

  

  While SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is Lok Sabha member from Azamgarh, has kept away from campaigning, the rescinding of the Quami Ekta Dal (QED) merger with the party by CM Akhilesh Yadav has also put pressure on the party.
  

  

  The CM has sought to compensate for his father’s absence by intensive campaigning in Azamgarh. His wife Dimple Yadav, too, has campaigned extensively, invoking her status as the “daughter-in-law” to seek public support.
  

  

  However, QED leaders Afzal and Mukhtar Ansari have put a spanner in the works of SP, especially in its bid to win support of backward and Muslim communities in Mau and Ballia districts.
  

  

  Two senior SP leaders, Ambika Chaudhary and Narad Rai, have also joined BSP, upsetting SP’s calculations in Ballia district.
  

  

  BSP, which has only nine MLAs in the constituencies going to the polls in the sixth phase, is expecting to better its tally after the induction of Ansari brothers in the party by capitalising on the feud within SP.
  

  

  BJP’s Lok Sabha member from Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanath, has a lot riding on him in this phase. Having campaigned extensively across the state, Yogi has been talked up as a potential CM candidate by his supporters in the BJP in this region.
  

  

  BJP currently has only seven MLAs from among the seats going to the polls in the sixth phase on Saturday and the party hopes to improve upon this.
  

  

  The party’s performance in Gorakhpur, Maharajga n j , Kushinagar and Deoria, in particular, is expected to reflect on the clout of Yogi and consequently his future stature within BJP after UP election.
  

  

  Union minister Kalraj Mishra’s clout will also be tested here as he is a Lok Sabha MP from Deoria, which goes to polls in this phase.
  

  

  BJP hopes to benefit from the alliance with local parties – Bharatiya Samaj Party, which champions the cause of OBC Rajbhar community, and Apna Dal, which derived its support from among OBC Kurmi community.

With modern amenities including schools, banks, ATMs and two police stations in place, the village has 18 puras (localities). Youth here invariably opts for career in armed forces prompting Indian army organise special recruitment camps in the village where mobile army canteens come every month for hundreds of retired personnel.
  

  

  Welcome to Gahmar, known worldwide as one of the most populated villages in the world. Around 130km from Varanasi, Gahmar is part of the Zamania assembly constituency in Ghazipur district. State minister and sitting MLA, Om Prakash Singh, as SP nominee, is pitted against BJP's Suntia Singh, a resident of Gahmar only. However, village pradhan, Meera Chaurasia's husband, Durga Chaurasia, is the ""de facto"" functionary in her place—'pradhan pati' as they are called in UP.
  

  

  Gahmar grabbed the limelight recently when Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his two rallies —at Ghazipur last year and Mau a few days back —recalled an incident of 1962 in the Lok Sabha when then sitting Ghazipur MP, Vishwanath Singh Gahmari— a native of Gahmar— made an emotional appeal in Parliament about extreme poverty in the region. His appeal had moved the then PM Pt JawaharLal Nehru and he formed the Patel Committee to make suggestions about poverty eradication in Purvanchal.
  

  

  As Modi recalled, Gahamri had cited as how people of the region picked cereals from the animal excreta (gobar) and eat, explaining extreme conditions people were forced to face. ""While harvesting, bulls often used to eat wheat and gram and used to release undigested. And the labourers filtered the gobar to use it as their meal,"" recalls Arun Kumar Singh, the only of the four sons of Gahmari, living in his native village.
  

  

  Gahamri passed away in 1974 but the Patel Committee, at his initiative, made several suggestions including construction of railway bridge over Ganga connecting Tarighat near Gahmar with Ghazipur. In an emotional appeal to voters of the region, Modi had mentioned about how the suggestions of the committee were ignored by the Congress for decades and his government has now started constructing the Tarighat-Ghazipur over bridge.

  ""Our only wish is to dedicate the under-construction bridge to our father,"" demands Gahmari's son, Arun Singh, who lives on the five bigha ancestral land in the village. He says it will be a fitting tribute to his father as there is no memorial in his name in the entire district.
  

  

  Billed as vistas of prosperity in the region, Tarighat-Gahmar bridge is one of the fulfilled promises that the BJP boasts of while wooing the voters in the ongoing polls as the region will witness polling in the last phase on March 8. ""The Congress and other parties had dumped the suggestions for years and it was the BJP, which took the initiative of constructing the bridge after prime minister laid the foundation stone two months back,"" says BJP nominee Sarita Singh, who seems strongly placed thanks to the non-Yadav OBC and upper caste voters rallying behind the saffron party.
  

  

  Bihar leader Dadan Pehalwan's son Kartar Yadav is also in fray and his presence means split in the Yadav vote-bank damaging prospects of SP nominee Om Prakash Singh. BSP candidate Atul Rai, who was allegedly part of the Mukhar Ansari gang, pins his hopes on Dait-Muslim combination.
  

  

  As caste factor continues as key to polls, few talk about issues like handicaps in the farming sector despite being a fertile region across Ganga. ""Opium factory was closed years ago and sugar mills are also defunct. We don't grow cash crops despite being in the most fertile region,"" laments a Gahmar elderly, Ramashray Prajapati."

Late on Thursday night, the administration pasted notices on the houses of the organizers of a proposed mahapanchayat and announced a ban on the event.
  

  Earton MenBoys Grey Sports Running ShoesShopcluesDo you think term insurance isn't affordable?MAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  Now RLD has come out against the mahapanchayat, claiming Bijnor is a peaceful city and no such activity should take place in the region that leads to communal unrest. Tension began to mount in and around Peda village as saffron outfits planned a mahapanchayat of 10,000 people on March 6 to protest alleged inaction by police in investigating the murder.
  

  

  On Friday, the district magistrate and superintendent of police summoned a delegation of Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, including its leader Shoorvir Singh, and told them not to hold the mahapanchayat as it would vitiate atmosphere in the region. However, the samiti members insisted that police must arrest all the accused in the 17-year-old's murder if it wanted them to call off the event. ""We were called at the collectrate and asked to withdraw our agitation. But we stuck to our demand of arrests of all the accused before March 6. We weren't offered any assurance and will go ahead with the mahapanchayat on the said day if our demand is not met,"" Shoorvir Singh told TOI.
  

  

  Singh claimed that police were trying to falsely implicate innocent men and were not arresting those named in the FIR as they are from another community. ""We are preparing for a mahapanchayat to mark our protest and will ensure at least 10,000 people participate in the event. Police cannot suppress our voice by pasting notices or issuing warnings. We are fighting for the right of the victim's family,"" he said.
  

  

  Meanwhile, RLD's lawyers wing on Friday took out a peace march in the city and submitted a memorandum to the superintendent of police urging the law enforcing agency not to allow the mahapanchayat. ""We are not in favour of holding the mahapanchayat. We should maintain peace and communal harmony in the area. Police should investigate the youth's murder honestly and the real culprits must be jailed,"" state president of RLD's lawyers wing, Vidhi Prakoshth, Praveen Deshwal said."
