"2","Congress pitches for opposition unity after MCD poll drubbing","NEW DELHI: After losing to the BJP in Delhi civic polls, the Congress today pitched for opposition unity, saying the regional parties should realise that ""blind anti- Congressism"" will not work.
  

  

  AICC incharge of communications department Randeep Surjewala said the parties must put the country first in the ""battle of ideologies"", remarks which come in the backdrop of attempts by leaders like JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee to rally anti-BJP forces to stop the saffron juggernaut.
  

  

  He also congratulated the BJP for its emphatic victory in Delhi MCD elections, in which Congress has been relegated to the third spot, and hoped it will work for a clean, corruption-free and development driven Delhi.
  

  

  ""Hope all regional parties will now realise that blind anti-Congressism is not the way. Country must come first in the battle of ideologies,"" Surjewala said on twitter.

"3","Old hands to train fresh faces before passing baton","NEW DELHI: It will take another week before BJP can start a fresh innings in the three municipal corporations. The state election commission has sent the final results of the civic polls to the LG, who will notify them. Following this, the newly-elected councillors can initiate the process for nomination and election of mayor and other positions.
  

  

  BJP won in 181 wards out of the 270, which went to polls on April 23. AAP bagged 48 seats and Congress just 30. ""Once the LG notifies the results of the elections, the newly elected representatives can take charge,"" said a senior official at SEC.

  While 50% of the seats are reserved for women in each corporation, the DMC Act stipulates appointment of a woman councillor as the first mayor during the five-year term of the municipal corporations. The mayor is changed every year. The mayors, deputy mayors and members of standing committees of the three corporations will be elected in the first meeting of the elected councillors.
  

  

  BJP has initiated the process of shortlisting names for the mayor's post in each corporation. There are over 200 candidates who will become councillors for the first time. Sources claim that the new members will be trained by former councillors in the next few days and help them understand their role.
  

  

  Sources in BJP say that Kamaljeet Sehrawat and Shikha Rai are the front runners for the mayor's post in the south civic body. Sehrawat won from Dwarka B ward by 9,000 votes, which was the highest margin this election, while Rai emerged winner from Greater Kailash ward by more than 8,000 ballots.
  

  

  BJP had fielded new faces for this year's polls and won by a bigger margin than the last civic elections.","delhi-mcd"
"5","Yawning gap or narrow win, it’s a talking point","SDMC's Chhattarpur ward saw a nail-biting contest between the BJP and AAP candidates that wasn't decided till the last round of counting. ""I was trailing after the first seven rounds of counting, but we astonishingly began making up up in last two rounds,"" said Anita Tanwar of BJP. Even then, it was only the last few votes that gave Tanwar the narrowest of wins by 2 votes over Pinky Tyagi. ""The ward was equally divided between AAP and us. We eventually got 8,145 votes, while they got 8,143,"" Tanwar said.
  

  

  Bhajanpura in east Delhi also saw a close race, but the story here was a bit different. Although BJP candidate Gurjeet Kaur managed to beat Congress rival Rekha by 58 votes, the counting wasn't a comfortable experience for either. ""We had a healthy lead initially, but it kept decreasing every round, leaving us nervous and shaken,"" Kaur's husband admitted.
  

  

  While Yasmin Kidwai of Congress beat Meeta Bhambry of BJP by 59 votes in Daryaganj, Pooja Jakhar of AAP triumphed in Chirag Dilli by a trifling margin of 73 votes, the fourth closest contest.
  

  

  ""We maintained our lead even when other candidates demanded a recount,"" said Surender Singh Kohli, AAP observer in the counting centre.
  

  

  
  

  

  Dwarka B saw the most lopsided contest
  

  

  Kamaljeet Sehrawat had the distinction of being the winner with the most resounding victory in the municipal polls. In the Dwarka B ward, BJP's Sehrawat, with 14,613 votes, left behind Sushma Bansal of AAP lagging far behind — 9,866 ballots behind to be precise. The runner-up could only manage 4,747 votes.

  Sanjeev Kapoor of BJP recorded the second highest margin of 9,322 votes while beating Naveen Kumar Gupta of AAP in the east Delhi ward of Krishna Nagar. The button next to his name was pushed by15,889 voters, with only 6,567 doing so for Gupta.
  

  

  It was a humiliating loss, by the third highest margin in these polls of 9,115, for veteran Congress member and outgoing leader of the Opposition in EDMC Varyam Kaur in Kanti Nagar. BJP's Kanchan Maheshwari proved the giant killer, getting the support of 15,491 voters to 6,376 for Kaur.

"6","92 Congress, 40 AAP candidates lose security deposit as BJP sweeps MCD polls","NEW DELHI: Over 70 per cent of the 2,516 candidates, including 40 of the AAP and 92 of the Congress, lost their security deposit in the Delhi municipal elections.
  

  

  ""As many as 1,790 candidates lost their deposit. In the 2012 municipal polls, 1,782 out of the 2,423 candidates in the fray had forfeited their deposit,"" Delhi State Election Commissioner S K Srivastava told reporters.
  

  

  The BJP, which scored a hat-trick in the municipal polls with a resounding victory, saw only five of its candidates losing their deposit.
  

  

  According to the Commission, about 40 AAP candidates lost deposit, while 92 of the Congress met the same fate.
  

  

  ""192 of the BSP and 94 of the JD(U), 55 of the 56 Shiv Sena candidates forfeited their deposit,"" he said.

  The BJP won 181 out of 270 wards for which the elections were held on April 23. The saffron party added muscle to its decade-long domination of the corporations effortlessly bucking anti-incumbency by riding on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
  

  

  
  

  

  

  The BJP's corporation-wise tally is: SDMC - 70, North Delhi - 64 and EDMC - 47 as against the AAP's tally of 16, 21 and 11 respectively. The Congress finished last with 12, 15 and 3 wards.","delhi-mcd"
"7","Change of guard in AAP after defeat","NEW DELHI: Chastened by the humiliating results of the municipal polls, the Aam Aadmi Party began restructuring the party set-up in the capital. On Thursday, the Political Affairs Committee led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appointed state labour minister Gopal Rai as the convenor in Delhi.
  

  

  A day after the results, Kejriwal met the AAP MLAs and asked them to fan out in their constituencies to assess the reason for the party's poor show. In the meeting, many MLAs discussed factors other than AAP's official line that the voting machines were unreliable. Some key issues broached included organisation building, re-assessment of the party's mass communication and outreach strategies and the need to enhance interactions with volunteers. BJP's campaign strategy centred on PM Narendra Modi also came up for discussion, sources said. There was admission that with back-to-back elections in Punjab, Goa and Delhi, the party had not got enough time to come up with a counter to BJP's strong pitch.

  On the key reason that AAP thinks it lost the polls — manipulation of EVMs — party MLAs corroborated the accusations by submitting information at Thursday's meeting about specific booths where they alleged the election process had been compromised. The party leadership would look into such cases to take them up with the authorities concerned.
  

  

  However, there were others in the party who felt they should move away from EVMs and consider strong communication strategies such as better outreach through jan sabhas. This was necessary, the AAP members said, because the party had failed to acquaint the masses with the good work done by Delhi government. On Wednesday itself, Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra, in a video message, had expressed the hope that AAP would introspect about the electoral route instead of simply blaming the EVMs.

  On Thursday evening, the Political Affairs Committee ratified the decision to make Gopal Rai, known for his skills in team management, the convener of the Delhi unit. Rai replaced Dilip Pandey, who was in the post ever since AAP came to power in Delhi in 2015. Pandey submitted his resignation soon after the poll results put AAP at a distant second with 48 seats against the 181 that BJP won in the three civic bodies.
  

  

  The party will also have to deal with a spate of other resignations. Delhi in-charge Ashish Talwar had resigned on Wednesday night, while APP's Punjab in-charge Sanjay Singh and co-in-charge Durgesh Pathak submitted their resignations on Thursday over the party's unexpectedly poor performance in the Punjab assembly elections. Both Singh and Pathak had offered to resign right after the Punjab results were announced, but were refrained from demitting charge till the Delhi municipal polls.","delhi-mcd"
"8","In high-stake contest, PM Modi BJP lifeline","NEW DELHI: Unlike 2015, the 'Modi wave' this time has helped BJP not just tide over strong anti-incumbency but improve its tally -- from from 138 to 181-- in the three corporations and crush the ruling AAP. In a strategic move, the party planned the election campaign around the Narendra Modi government's achievements and asked voters to make the national capital 'Narendra Modiji ke sapno ki Dilli'.
  

  

  Though corporation elections are largely about local issues, BJP focused on the Centre's work as this was a high-stake election. Victory in this election was crucial for BJP, which is on a winning spree, to remain relevant in state politics. ""Unlike other political parties, we decided to run a positive campaign to tell people about the achievements of the Modi government. And people have responded positively to our campaign,"" said Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.
  

  

  Though BJP had to fight strong anti-incumbency due to its poor performance, it successfully turned the municipal elections into a ""referendum on the AAP government"". Party members say people could connect with BJP's campaign due to ""lack of governance"" in the city under AAP's rule. The party has been running a sustained campaign, attacking the AAP government for lack of development in the city, citing the ruling party's political ambitions as the prime reason.

  Another major decision, which many said would harm the party, was to deny tickets to sitting councillors and their relatives. There were protests by councillors and some decided to contest the election independently. But this didn't impact the party, which was quick to expel 21 rebels days before polling. ""It was a bold decision which all our party workers accepted. There was no major opposition within the party. We could take this decision as we have strong organizational base,"" said Shyam Jaju, Delhi BJP in-charge. Wednesday's verdict showed that rebels couldn't cause much damage to the party.
  

  

  After its crushing defeat in the 2015 assembly elections, BJP had carefully worked out its strategy to revive the party in the state. The first major step in this direction, BJP members say, was to appoint the Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician as its state unit chief. ""The demography of Delhi has changed over the years. Tiwari is an MP, a celebrity and party's Poorvanchali face. His appointment has infused the party with new energy,"" said a party member. Tiwari successfully took forward the party's campaign to highlight lack of development in the city by staying in slums and villages.
  

  

  BJP members say the party's decision to field 34 Poorvanchalis played a crucial role in its victory in wards with a large number of unauthorized colonies and slum clusters that were considered AAP strongholds.
  

  

  It also helped BJP that senior Congress leaders like Arvinder Singh Lovely, Barkha Shukla Singh and Amrish Gautam crossed over to its fold ahead of the elections.","delhi-mcd"

  Shah termed the party's resounding win in the civic polls as another public endorsement of Modi's leadership and rule.
  

  

  He said people have rejected politics of negativity and excuses, and given a clear message ""they want politics of development and positivity"".
  

  

  ""The Modi-led BJP government has been in power at the Centre for almost three years. The message given by this government through its work has raised the acceptance level of Modiji's leadership. This victory has only reaffirmed it,"" Shah told the media at the Press Club here.

  However, the party also talked about the need for introspection. Yadav said unlike AAP, Swaraj India is in no hurry to expand its political footprint in the country. ""We will be careful in our selection about where to contest. It will depend on our organisation's preparedness. We will contest elections on a positive agenda,"" Yadav said.

""It was after our sustained protest that the AAP government decided that it will not give any new licence for liquor vends. They proposed changes in the Lokpal Bill after we raised the issue.

    Vinay Sahasrabuddhe
    , tells that the party's track record of good governance has earned it great credibility. Excerpts:
  
  

  

  What were the key factors in BJP's win?
  

  

  First, it is the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, who has become a symbol of national aspiration for development and good governance. In our national president Amitbhai Shah, we have a master strategist. Besides, there was our track record of good governance which has earned us great credibility. And let's remember that people always vote for those who are seriously into politics with a robust organisational network and clear and sound policies.
  

  

  
    Whose idea was it to drop sitting corporators?
    

  
  

  In our party, all decisions are taken collectively under the leadership of our president. Dropping incumbent corporators was an experiment that we have done in the past too. This decision was not unusual, at least in BJP.
  

  

  
    But there was a risk of rebellion.

  Well, one can always expect some rumblings and unpleasantness after this kind of decision. But we know that ideology-driven and cadre-based parties can digest such decisions and that is what actually happened. We could, at the end of the day, manage such issues.
  

  

  
    Amit Shah was actively involved in the polls.
    

  
  

  Yes and he was supremely effective. In fact, there are three Ds that go with Amit Shah's name. First is dedication. He works for nearly 16-17 hours and makes others work too. Second is his decisiveness. He is known for taking even difficult decisions very firmly. Then, his discipline. He remains and also makes everybody accountable.
  

  

  
    How do you see the AAP's politics?

"15","Last-placed, infighting cost Congress heavily","NEW DELHI: As Congress finished a poor third in the municipal elections with a seat tally of 30 as against its previous tally of 77, hopes for its revival in Delhi appear bleak. Taking responsibility for the party's dismal performance in the polls, Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken resigned but not before blaming former CM Sheila Dikshit and other senior politicians for not extending a helping hand during election campaigns.
  

  

  The Congress revival story was badly hit by infighting, which peaked when former PCC chief and former Delhi minister Arvinder Singh Lovely joined BJP just before the polls. Another former MLA and Mahila Congress president Barkha Singh too crossed over to BJP.
  

  

  In this backdrop, the poll results saw Congress win 12 seats in the south corporation, 15 in north and just three seats in the east corporation. The number of seats has gone down from 2012, when Congress won 19 seats in the east corporation, 29 each in south and north civic bodies.
  

  

  In the east, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had joined the safai karamcharis who were on strike in 2015 and the party's main agenda, for this election, revolved around the same issue but it failed to make an impact.
  

  

  Despite its complete marginalisation, Congress is comparing this year's municipal poll results with the assembly election results of 2015 when it failed to open its account and claims that there has been a rise in the vote share by 11%.
  

  

  Leader of the opposition in the east corporation Varyam Kaur, who contested from Gandhi Nagar ward, lost to BJP by a margin of 9,000 votes. Kaur, who was considered a heavyweight, lost to Kanchan Maheshwari, a first-timer from BJP. Another heavyweight Virender Kasana, councillor from CR Park, lost to BJP's Subhash Bhadana and Praveen Rana from Bijwasan ward lost to AAP candidate Narender Rana.
  

  

  On the brighter side, Andrews Ganj councillor Abhishek Dutt retained his seat—he won by more than 4,000 votes and Yasmeen Kidwai, who contested for the first time from the Daryaganj ward in place of leader of the opposition in south corporation Farhad Suri, won the seat. A total of 92 candidates forfeited their deposits.

  Last week, Maken had confidently announced that Congress would come to power in the three corporations, claiming that the party was on a strong wicket after the Rajouri Garden bypoll. In the bypoll that held on April 9, Congress vote share had gone up from 9% to 33%. But what followed next was a string of resignations from the party and posts.
  

  

  The first blow came when former cabinet minister A K Walia threatened to quit the party over ticket distribution. Thereafter, several other senior functionaries, including Sandeep Dikshit and Mangat Ram Singh came out in open and criticised Maken's alleged high-handedness in the managing the election affairs.
  

  

  After Congress retained the second position in Rajouri Garden bypoll, the major blow came from former DPCC chief Lovely, who joined BJP.
  

  

  Former Sheila Dikshit and senior functionary Harun Yusuf stayed away from the campaign. Dikshit had said she was not asked to campaign while Maken claimed to have sent a letter to every senior leader of Congress to join the poll campaign.","delhi-mcd"
"16","Muslims lose faith in AAP, inch back to Congress","NEW DELHI: The municipal poll results indicated that the Muslim vote — which helped Aam Aadmi Party substantially in the assembly polls of 2015 — was divided between Aam Aadmi Party and Congress. Though Arvind Kejriwal's party did win in a number of Muslim-majority areas, the margins were lower than those recorded two years ago.
  

  

  A day after BJP astonished Delhi by retaining the corporations for a third consecutive term, many Muslims confessed that on polling day they had been unsure of AAP's prospects due to, as one put it, the ""media's insistence that there is a wave against AAP"", and this had affected their voting decision. Iftikhar Ahmed, a watch seller in Batla House in south Delhi, nuanced this by explaining that AAP's loss was ""because every election has a wind in favour of one party, and this time there was a wave against AAP"".
  

  

  However, Ahmed was unwilling to blame only a wave to the exclusion of other factors. In fact, he said, ""AAP's reputation has dwindled due to its inadequacies in managing the city after coming to power."" And this perception that Kejriwal's party is doing little for the community is driving voters away.
  

  

  In Okhla, Muslims did not support AAP — as it had in electing the party's Amanatullah Khan as MLA in 2015 — because ""the promises made to us have not been fulfilled"", according to Zia Ul Haque, a plywood shop owner. Haque said that the CM often tweeted about new schools and hospitals in other areas, ""but nothing of this sort has been done for us"".

  Perhaps the division of votes to the detriment of AAP was most stark in Zakir Nagar in south Delhi, where Shoaib Danish of Congress retained his seat by just 1,070 votes, despite, as a voter grumbled, ""poor maintenance of the area for many years"". AAP's Mehmood Ahmad lost out because many of his supporters opted for RJD's Muslim candidate, even as Congress retained its base.
  

  

  Besides the divided support, Muslims voters suggested AAP has lost their trust. ""People had given AAP a chance thinking that it was new and would usher in progress in areas like ours,"" said Naeem, a butcher in Chitli Qabar in the Walled City. ""But we have only heard AAP leaders talking about how powerless they are."" Others said they had great hopes from AAP MLA Alka Lamba, but ""she is rarely seen in our localities"".
  

  

  Parvez Akhtar, a Turkman Gate shop owner, accused the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation of not providing enough funds to sitting corporator Aaley Mohammad Iqbal of Congress, who, he said, ""spend from his pocket to help the people"". Iqbal vanquished AAP's Riyazuddin by 7,519 votes.
  

  

  Kejriwal's image of a confrontationist also alarmed Muslims. Raeesuddin, a restaurant owner in Jama Masjid area, said, ""While the councillors say the MLA doesn't give them funds, Kejriwal told us the central government doesn't let him work."" Fed up, Raeesuddin said, the Muslims voted for the party with which they have always been comfortable.","delhi-mcd"

  As many as 2,537 candidates contested for elections to the Cpital's three civic bodies on Sunday. The polls saw a 53.53% voter turnout, better than the previous occasion.

  On its charge of ""manipulation"" of EVMs, Yadav said - ""It's not the software of EVM, but it's the software of the ruling party that needs to be changed"".
  

  

  He added that municipal elections in Delhi were ""foundational elections"" for the Swaraj India Party and its leaders had ""zero expectations"" of winning any seat. He also said his party focussed on ""real issues"" that the people of Delhi were facing, like cleanliness, hygiene and health.

  While there is still time to finalise the candidates, several names are already doing the rounds for the key posts — Kamaljeet Sehrawat, Shikha Rai and Nandani Sharma are among the potential candidates for south Delhi.
  

  

  Sehrawat, a former president of Delhi BJP's women's wing, is a strong contender as she has won from Dwarka-B ward by 9,866 votes, the highest margin in the polls this time. Party members said she was very active as the president of state unit's women's wing. Rai, who is a vice-president in Delhi BJP, too has a strong hold in the party.
  

  

  While most councillors are first-timers, BJP members said the party's s election for mayoral candidate would be based on experience and seniority. ""We will start the process soon. It will be a mixture of experience and fresh faces. We will select candidates who can ensure smooth implementation of party's agenda,"" said Harish Khurana, Delhi BJP spokesperson.

Party members said Anju Jain, a second-time councillor, might also be considered due to her experience. She was elected a councillor in 2007.
  

  

  In east Delhi, Neema Bhagat, who won from Geeta Colony, is the top contender as she is a second-time councillor.
  

  

  While BJP members said there would not be much problem in selecting the mayors, the real challenge would be in appointing the standing committee chairmen, leaders of the House, zonal chairmen and members of various committees on health, education, horticulture, etc. ""The party plans to strengthen the leadership at the zonal level, as the zone chairmen will ensure proper implementation of all policies, which will be prepared by the corporations,"" said Praveen Shankar Kapoor, media in-charge, Delhi BJP.

"21","3 AAP councillors brave the wave","NEW DELHI: In an election where sitting councillors were steamrolled by the freshers of BJP, three AAP incumbents, elected to the municipal corporation in the by-polls last year, retained their seats. There weren't too many others on Wednesday, who like Ashok Kumar, Mohammad Sadiq and Ramesh Matiala, could boast of beating both anti-incumbency and the saffron wave.
  

  

  Kumar, who represented Vikas Nagar but was moved to Hastsal this time, was ahead of BJP's Harish Harjai by 965 votes. ""I humbly thank the people of my ward who gave me this opportunity to serve them. I had given my best in serving the people after last year's by-elections,"" Kumar said.
  

  

  The councillor, who has studied only up to Class X, said his humility and hard work had obviously caught the eye of the electorate. After moving to the new ward, Kumar strove to meet as many people as possible. ""I interacted with people from all sections, heard their problems and promised them my complete attention,"" he said.
  

  

  Matiala had a more comfortable relection from Matiala ward, beating his BJP rival Surendra Kumar by 3,857 votes. ""I thank the people of my ward for reposing faith in me,"" he said. AAP's sitting councillor from Ballimaran, Mohammad Sadiq, also weathered anti-incumbency handsomely, vanquishing Congress' Mohammad Qazzafi by 6,970 votes. Less than a year after winning the by-polls in May last year, Sadiq seemed to have a comfortable trust level with his electorate. ""I will use the opportunity to further help the people of my ward,"" Sadiq vowed.
  

  

  Rakesh Kumar too returned to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. Originally a member of Rashtriya Lok Dal, he had shifted to AAP in 2013 and won this year's contest from Ajmeri Gate triumphing over Congress' Abhay Singh Yadav by 1,952 votes.

"23","Divided Opposition makes all the difference in BJP tally","NEW DELHI: The BJP lost marginally in terms of vote share compared to the last
  MCD elections+
  in 2012, dropping from 36.7% to 36.1%, but enhanced its seat tally from 138 to 181.
  

  

  In comparison to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, its vote share dropped by 10.5 percentage points from 46.6% and yet the number of wards where it finished in front came down by only 25 from 206 in those elections.
  

  

  Put that down to a more divided opposition vote this time and the vagaries of the first past-the-post system.
  

  

  The comparison with the 2015 assembly polls is equally dramatic. The
  BJP has gained+
  a relatively modest 3.9 percentage points of vote share since then but has seen its tally of wards jumped in the process from a mere 26 two years ago to 181 now.
  

  

  The explanation lies in what's been happening to the non-BJP vote in the meantime.
  

  

  In 2012, the Congress was the only major opposition to the BJP and polled over 30% of votes. As a result, it was able to restrict the BJP to just over half the total seats in the three municipal corporations.
  

  

  Two years later, in the Lok Sabha polls, the AAP had become a major factor in Delhi politics acquiring a vote share similar to the Congress in 2012, but the
  Modi wave+
  meant that the BJP's own vote share rose to nearly 47%.
  CATBIRD Blue Stylish Loafer For Girls 517-F W048-517-F-BlueShopcluesसिर्फ 2 हफ्ते में खत्म हो रही डायबिटीजGlyxGoRecommended By Colombia

  

  As a result, the BJP led in 206 of the 272 wards. The 2015 polls saw the BJP's vote share dipping to 32.2%, not drastically lower than in 2012, but with the Congress collapsing and AAP touching over 54%, a 30-something vote share was good enough for leads in only a little over two dozen wards.
  

  

  Does the fact that the BJP's vote share now is hardly different from 2012, when there was no Modi factor at all, mean there was no Modi effect in these polls?
  

  

  That would be a simplistic conclusion.
  

  

  For the BJP to have held on to its vote shares from five years ago in the face of a huge anti-incumbency after ten years of running the MCDs is no mean achievement, particularly considering that the polity has in the meantime become triangular rather than just bipolar. And much of that must be put down to the Modi effect neutralizing anti-incumbency. What the drop of over 10 percentage points since 2014 does mean however is that the Modi magic does not quite have the same effect in a municipal poll as it did in a national election. But that's hardly surprising.","delhi-mcd"
"24","Sweep for BJP, Delhi dumps broom: Test for Kejriwal to keep his flock together","NEW DELHI: BJP's gambit in replacing all its sitting municipal councillors, putting an outsider, actor Manoj Tiwari, at the helm of the state unit and using
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi+
  as a trump card has paid it handsome dividends in the elections to the three
  municipal corporations in Delhi+
  .
  

  

  It steamrolled AAP and restricted Congress to a modest revival by taking 181 of the 270 seats — that's over two thirds — for which polling took place last Sunday. Tiwari,
  Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav+
  — a former colleague of Kejriwal — and state Congress chief Ajay Maken have all invoked the idea of 'Right of Recall' to urge Kejriwal to step down as CM.
  

  

  ""A party which won 67 assembly seats just two years back couldn't win even 67 wards,"" said Tiwari, rubbing it in. For AAP, the outcome could not have been worse, coming as it did on the heels of its humiliating defeat in the Rajouri Garden bypoll and soon after its loss in Punjab and Goa.
  

  

  It was left vying with Congress for seats and vote share, doing marginally better than the latter. It got only 16 seats in south (BJP 70, Congress 12), 21 in north (BJP 64, Congress 15) and 11 in east (BJP 47, Congress 3). AAP had hoped it would be able to favourably contrast its performance in the state government with BJP's in the MCD, but the strategy didn't work.
  

  

  Also, by dumping all its sitting councillors, BJP managed to signal a clean break from its 10-year-old legacy even as it rode on Modi's huge post-UP popularity. Raising a scare over disease outbreaks because of the insanitary conditions in the city didn't serve AAP well. The party needs to introspect if it wants to remain a credible player in Indian politics, according to most political analysts. It, however, appears to be in a state of denial, having worked out a consistent strategy of blaming
  EVM-tampering+
  for defeats.
  

  

  ""BJP has done nothing but spread corruption, dengue and chikungunya in Delhi. There's no reason for people to vote for BJP again. It is unbelievable. If the margin of victory had been low we could have accepted it. But the huge difference is not possible without rigging the elections,"" said deputy CM Manish Sisodia.
  

  

  However, later in the day, Kejriwal congratulated BJP on its victory, saying in a tweet that his government ""looks forward to working wid (sic) MCDs for the betterment of Delhi"".
  

  

  The question on many lips is: Will Kejriwal & Co now get serious about engaging with the real issues - such as repairing roads and augmenting the bus fleet - instead of being in a permanent state of conflict with the Centre and bristling at every criticism.
  

  

  Kejriwal, who has stayed out of Delhi for long periods, will have to guard his flock that will now be more vulnerable to temptation from BJP.
  

  

  In case of an adverse verdict from Election Commission of India in the office-of-profit case, which will lead to the disqualification of 21 party MLAs, such attempts will assume urgency and could pose an existential crisis for AAP.
  

  

  For its part, BJP, after this massive mandate, cannot afford to let the rot within the municipal corporations it rules continue, say civic experts.
  

  

  It will have to bring about a perceptible change in the way the corporations function - from streamlining processes to sticking to deadlines to cutting out corruption.
  

  

  Blaming Kejriwal for denying funds to the corporations won't work because state party chief Tiwari had indicated that they would find new ways, like direct funding by the Centre.
  

  

  The fact that there has been a marginal decline in its vote share - from 36.7% in 2012 to 36.1% this time - should be a sobering thought.
  

  

  Tiwari's strenuous campaigning has helped him shake off the outsider tag; he also enjoys the central leadership's solid backing.
  

  

  The party's immediate challenge is to ensure sanitation and salaries for MCD staff. In this tri-polar contest, Congress chief Ajay Maken's efforts to revive his party's fortunes with virtually no support from other state leaders failed.
  

  

  Former chief minister Sheila Dikshit stayed away and no other leader was visible during campaigning. They say they were not made to feel welcome. There were rumblings within the fractious state unit over ticket distribution.

  Former minister A K Walia threatened to quit and east Delhi strongman Arvinder Singh Lovely dealt a severe blow to the party by actually doing so in a huff, promptly joining BJP.
  

  

  He was followed by former Delhi Commission for Women chief Barkha Singh, who even questioned Rahul Gandhi's state of health. Having improved its vote share in the Rajouri Garden byelection, Maken ran a largely positive campaign with multiple manifestoes on various issues.
  

  

  Given the heavy odds he was up against, there is no great surprise over the party's third-place finish. Although he has already sent in his resignation, he is seen as Rahul Gandhi's choice to run the party in Delhi and the options for Congress are limited.
  

  

  ""Our vote share went down to 9% in the 2015 assembly elections and from there it has improved. I took charge as DPCC president when Congress couldn't open its account in the 2015 elections. It has been a difficult journey and party workers worked really hard. We have made a reasonable comeback but it is not what I had hoped for,"" said Maken.","delhi-mcd"

So it might seem like the pollsters got it more or less right. But the reality is that they got what they actually measure horribly wrong but were saved by seat forecasts that weren't wildly off the mark.
  

  

  Exit polls actually measure voting intentions, that is which party is getting what vote share, and then try and convert that into votes. But the two exit polls for the MCD elections gave the BJP a vote share that was way higher than what the party actually got when the results were out.

  The India Today-Axis poll predicted that the BJP would win 43% of votes in the three municipal corporations put together, with its share varying between 41% in the North and 44% in the South and East. The ABP News-CVoter poll gave even higher vote shares to the BJP - from a minimum of 49.2% in the South to 52.3% in the North.
  

  

  The actual vote shares bagged by the saffron party varied between 34.9% in the South and 38.6% in the East to total 36.1% for all three corporations. That means the Axis poll got the figure wrong by about 7 percentage points and the CVoter poll by nearly 15 percentage points. Those are not small errors.
  

  

  Not surprisingly, both pollsters underestimated the AAP vote shares, though not by as large a margin. The Axis poll put it at 24% and CVoter at 18.6% while it actuall;y won 26.2% of the votes. Interestingly, the error in the case of the Congress was on either side of the actual number. The Axis poll overestimated the party's shares while the CVoter poll consistently underestimated it, but again not by huge margins.
  

  

  Fortunately for the pollsters, the gap between the BJP and AAP or Congress was so huge that these errors did not matter too much when it came to seat tallies. Thus, against the 200-plus seats that both had predicted, the BJP won 181, which seemed close enough for them to get away with the impression that they had gauged the vote right.","delhi-mcd"

"29","MCD election results: Demonetisation, Narendra Modi worked wonders for BJP","NEW DELHI: BJP's success in retaining its votebank and managing a 3.9% increase over the 2015 assembly polls is being read by the party as benefits of demonetisation, the Centre's Mudra Bank loan and Ujjwala schemes that gave it a ""pro-poor"" orientation.
  

  

  The strong welfare push seems to have given BJP a crucial edge in making inroads in the wards where it has fared poorly earlier and where delimitation was expected to favour its rivals. The demonetisation effect clubbed with focus on Poorvanchali community seems to have helped it gain votes in slums and unauthorised colonies. The JJ clusters, which have a sizable Poorvanchali population, had voted AAP to power in 2015.
  

  

  The party sealed its victory due to three-way division of votes and AAP's share falling steeply from 54.3% to 26.2%, as compared to 2015. Delhi BJP in-charge Shyam Jaju said, ""People have recognised the work done by the Modi government in the last three years.""
  

  

  ""We held camps in east Delhi for Mudra scheme and helped many take benefit of Ujjwala (cooking gas for BPL) scheme,"" said Virendra Sachdeva, member of BJP's good governance cell and former district president of Mayur Vihar.
  

  

  BJP's decision to appoint Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari as Delhi unit chief worked well in capturing the Poorvanchali vote, which is now a key component in Delhi politics.
  

  

  For the first time, the party gave tickets to 34 Poorvanchalis, including some from slums. ""It was a major step that helped us win in areas like Trilokpuri west, which had never voted for the party. Tiwari's night stay in slums and villages helped,"" said Sachdeva.

  In 2013, party candidate Vijay Bhagat had lost from Badli assembly constituency, but won from Sharda Nand Colony in 2017 municipal polls. Similarly, BJP has won in many wards in Burari, Kirari, Badarpur, Karawal Nagar, among others.
  

  

  ""In six assembly constituencies around Patparganj (represented by deputy CM Manish Sisodia), we have won close to 25 wards. We lost Jhilmil and our candidate's nomination was rejected from Vinod Nagar,"" said Abhay Verma, state vice-president.
  

  

  Focussing its campaign around PM Narendra Modi and people's perceived anger against AAP helped neutralise anti-incumbency. The three corporations had failed on numerous counts during the party's decade-long rule.
  

  

  Even delimitation seems to have worked out in BJP's favour. The party won three out of five wards in Najafgarh, the assembly constituency that BJP has won just once in 2013. Similarly, in Badarpur, the party won four out of five wards. The party also managed to retrieve more of its middle-class areas, ike Vishwas Nagar, Greater Kailash and Malviya Nagar that voted for Modi in 2014, but went with AAP in 2015.","delhi-mcd"
"30","MCD result may spur opposition unity talks","NEW DELHI: In a local election that went national,
  BJP's sweep of Delhi's municipal polls+
  emphatically underlines the party's political domination and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popular appeal with voters across the country and could spark moves to stitch opposition unity.
  

  

  The result, with
  Aam Admi Party and Congress+
  jockeying for second spot, gives BJP the satisfaction of settling scores with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for the humiliating drubbing it received in the 2015 assembly poll and the concerted manner in which the leader has attacked the PM since then.
  

  

  The implications of the election are far wider than a decision on who will fix the city's drains. For a party that was once seen as an alternative model in politics and a leader who could capture the popular imagination, AAP's slide on its home turf is nothing short of a May Day call for the outfit. BJP held onto its middle class support but seems to have made some inroads, aided by demonetisation, in AAP ""constituencies"" like unauthorised colonies and slums where Congress seems to have revived its fortunes too.
  

  

  The big gamble of changing almost all sitting councillors along with a decision to sideline the older guard in the city by installing north east Delhi MP and popular Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari as the Delhi party chief paid off handsomely. BJP president Amit Shah, who along with the PM, was instrumental in the crucial decision to junk all serving councillors, some of them known favourites of state and central leaders, was the game changer that wiped out a two-term incumbency that had delivered very average performance.
  

  

  Modi and the BJP chief had advocated a similar shock therapy for BJP candidates in Punjab but the plan did not go through due to concerns that it was too risky a gambit to attempt. With the UP win boosting confidence and adrenalin running high, Shah decided to brook no protest even though some BJP councillors had a good record to run on.
  

  

  BJP's continued rise can quicken opposition talks for a presidential candidate with Sonia Gandhi meeting Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.
  

  

  Regional parties facing BJP might be prompted to look at joining hands in an alliance though there remain strong contradictions within them. But with Congress on the decline, anti-Congressism could weaken.

  BJP's victory in wards comprising slum clusters, below poverty line and irregular colonies was enabled by the demonetisation which propelled Modi and BJP into the minds of the city's poor. The gambit to admit Congress leaders like Arvinder Lovely worked to demoralise the party that looked to be gaining.After UP polls, the Delhi outcome is yet another evidence that ""note ban"" has added new adherents from among con stituents of its rivals without loss of BJP's own voter base.The important win in Delhi cements BJP's string of wins in urban civic elections in several states and will encourage efforts to showcase itself as the party of the poor as Congress did under Indira Gandhi. During the third anniversary of the Modi government, there may be attempt to amplify the message further.
  

  

  BJP has become the party of choice for voters and politicians and Shah has pragmatically opened the doors for cross overs from Congress and other parties. The decimation of AAP should shrink the possibility of Kejriwal cutting into anti-BJP votes which have so far been cornered by Congress.

  The failure to make a significant mark even though its vote went up compounds Congress's problems not the least because its face Ajay Maken enjoyed the ""most-favoured person"" status under Rahul Gandhi and this enabled him to ride roughshod over protests from peers and seniors in Delhi politics -from Sheila Dikshit to A K Walia to Arvinder Lovely who joined BJP.
  

  

  The question of who should lead Congress as Sonia fades, will acquire a sharp focus though whether the veterans reeling under neglect from Rahul, given the unquestioning dependence on the family , will articulate fear of irrelevance agitating them, remains a big question. The outcome gives rise to serious questions about AAP's future, if Kejriwal continues to blame the defeat on AVMS and does not get down to diagnose the cause for the desertion of voters.","delhi-mcd"
"31","From tea stall to Civic Centre: A Modi-fied story","NEW DELHI: A tea seller becoming an elected leader of the people — if PM Narendra Modi made this a paradigm of the Indian dream, Avtar Singh has lived out a similar dream too. If you don't quite recall Singh's name, you can be forgiven. For, it was only this week — when the returning officer in the Civil Lines municipal ward signed a certificate bearing his name — that the saffron-turbaned Sikh moved out of Ajmeri Gate's shadows and into the limelight.
  

  Mutual Funds ke liye FundsIndia Sahi HaiFundsIndiaDelight customers with a cognitive journeyIBMRecommended By Colombia

  After Singh lost his job as a hotel waiter in the 1980s, Singh eked out a living sell syrupy tea under a peepal tree in Ajmeri Gate for over a decade. But this was only an augury of good things. ""Selling tea is not a small job,"" he pointed out to TOI on Friday. ""You get to interact with people, so I made lots of friends."" His large circle of friends propelled him into local politics, and like the PM, he became strongly influenced by RSS.
  

  

  Destiny dealt a second ironic blow when he was jailed in 1994. As an organiser of the Ajmeri Gate Ramlila, Singh put up a religious hoarding on a site meant for government advertisements and was booked. In Tihar Jail, he despaired over his wife having to vend tea to be able to feed their two children. But it was also in jail that he came in contact with some political leaders. ""Before the court acquitted me of all wrongdoing, these leaders influenced my thinking and encouraged me,"" Singh recollected.
  

  

  Now, mindful of the many difficulties he has faced in life — dropping out of school after his father's death, doing odd jobs to pay for a diploma course on store-keeping, working as a waiter, selling tea for a living — Singh disdains the better life that his current courier business affords him. He continues to live in a humble 20-yard house.
  

  

  Singh today represents the upscale Civil Lines in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. But his elevation has not changed his outlook on life. The man who looks up to Atal Bihari Vajpayee as a role model rides on his modest grey scooter through Civil Lines every day, ensuring civic order in the ward.","delhi-mcd"
"32","Can't just blame EVMs, time to introspect: AAP leaders divided after defeat in MCD polls","NEW DELHI: Delhi Minister Kapil Mishra on Wednesday joined several AAP members in calling for introspection over the party's rout in the MCD polls, saying the loss cannot be blamed only on EVMs even as the party leadership alleged ""rigging"" of voting machines.
  

  

  ""This is the time to introspect why we had to see this day after two years. Whether it a Modi wave or not, it has become clear that people have not voted for us. Today's reality is we have got very few seats in comparison to the massive mandate we got in 2015. The results cannot be viewed only by blaming the EVMs,"" Mishra said.
  

  

  He also admitted that looking at poll results, a ""BJP wave"" exists in Delhi.
  

  

  Interestingly, senior AAP leader and Labour Minister Gopal Rai had said there is ""no Modi wave"", but an ""EVM wave,"" alleging tampering of electronic voting machines.
  

  

  Several volunteers, the backbone of the party, are also refusing to buy the claims made by the leadership.
  

  

  An MLA from Central Delhi echoed the minister's sentiments.
  

  

  ""The reasons are shocking as we did not expect to do so badly. Although the party blames EVMs for the defeat and we need to look into the reasons behind the loss, my view is different. But I shall toe the party line on this,"" the MLA said.
  

  

  In Punjab, party MP Bhagwant Mann said there was no use in finding fault with EVMs and the party should introspect on the reasons behind its defeat in the recent Assembly polls.
  

  

  He also slammed the leadership for ""behaving like a 'mohalla' (local) cricket team,"" and said AAP had committed a ""historic blunder"" in Punjab with regard to the overall electoral strategy.
  

  

  AAP Punjab state convener Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi also endorsed Mann's remarks.

  After the party won only 20 seats in Punjab, Kejriwal had alleged tampering of EVMs in the polls.
  

  

  Reacting to Mann's position on EVMs, Delhi deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the party would introspect on reasons behind its defeat, but that it does not mean EVMs were not tampered with.
  

  

  ""Looking at the situation, it seems that there is an EVM wave in Delhi,"" Sisodia said.
  

  

  ""There is no reason why people should vote for the BJP (in the MCD polls). We will analyse the reasons behind our defeat. We would have understood had there been a difference of 2-4 seats, but the margin between the two parties can only happen by rigging the EVMs,"" Sisodia said.","delhi-mcd"

  BJP tried the tactic in the 2013 assembly polls where it put sports minister Vijay Goel's face as the challenger to Kejriwal even when the saffron party had not declared a CM nominee.
  

  

  AAP managed 27 seats then and formed the government with Congress support. This time, the ploy did not work even as Gupta protested that the posters depicted a ""distorted"" grumpy visage.

The loss came despite AAP's promise to waive house tax on residential properties besides holding out a vision of a cleaner Delhi. Its promise to provide cheaper water and electricity, besides other factors, had led to a landslide victory in assembly elections just two years ago.
  

  

  ""BJP has done nothing but spread corruption, dengue and chikungunya in Delhi. There is no reason for people to vote for BJP again. It is unbelievable. If the margin of victory had been low, we could have accepted it. But the huge difference is not possible without rigging the elections,"" said deputy CM Manish Sisodia.
  

  

  Sisodia said BJP was earlier vocal against the vulnerability of EVMs but has now changed its stance. ""After losing elections in 2009, BJP did research on tampering of EVMs and they are winning elections on the basis of what they learnt in five years,"" he alleged. His cabinet colleague, Gopal Rai, was sharper in his comment. ""It's an EVM wave, not a Modi wave,"" he said.

  Except in Vinod Nagar, BJP-supported candidates did not even get the second-highest votes. AAP won four wards and Congress got one.
  

  

  The party had decided to support these candidates after the nominations of its candidates were rejected by the state election commission. While the party alleged that the candidates were rejected on ""frivolous grounds"", it had little option but to support Independent candidates. BJP workers in the five wards had helped these candidates in their election campaign.
  

  

  In Abul Fazal Enclave, a Muslim-dominated area, BJP had supported Gulfam who got just 870 votes, while AAP candidate Abdul Wajid Khan got 10,374 votes. Similarly, in Bapraula and Lado Sarai, AAP candidates won by a margin of more than 2,000 votes. Only in east Delhi's Vinod Nagar, the BJP-supported candidate, Rahul Singh, lost by just 151 votes. BJP members said that Singh, who filed his nomination on an NCP ticket and later accepted support from BJP, was a strong contender. BJP members said that the party would have won the seat if its candidate's nomination was not rejected.

  However, celebrations at Delhi BJP headquarters were low key in the wake of the Naxal attack at Sukma in which 25 CRPF men died. There were no drums, no sweets and no loud music; instead, a few BJP workers blew conches while welcoming Tiwari to the party office. Tiwari dedicated the victory to the martyrs and their families.

""We lost because people did not vote for us,"" he said.
  

  

  ""This is our sixth defeat because we were disconnected with volunteers,"" Vishwas said while apologising to the party volunteers for going against their wishes. He also cautioned the party against taking decisions behind closed doors, which volunteers could not defend on the ground.
  

  

  ""There was a big gap in AAP's communication due to which the party was unable to convey what the Delhi government did for the people. Another reason could be that people were angry with us on some issues,"" he said. ""BJP was able to communicate its message to the people and we were a unable to counter that.""
  

  

  Admitting that ""there are short-comings"" in EVMs, Vishwas said this issue could be taken up at appropriate forums such as the election commission and the court. But AAP, he said, needs to think what was the aim of the fight that started from Jantar Mantar. ""Corruption, Congress, Modi or EVM...the short-comings in EVMs is one part of it."" The party's top brass has lost the connect with grassroots workers and the party needs an overhaul, said Vishwas, who has been with AAP since its inception in 2012.
  

  

  Vishwas's remarks are significant considering that chief minister and AAP's national convener Arvind Kejriwal had been blaming ""faulty"" EVMs since the party's disappointing performance in the assembly elections in Goa and Punjab. He had even threatened to launch an agitation over alleged manipulation of EVMs.

  severe blow to the AAP+
  and dashing the Congress' hope of a revival.
  

  

  Winning 181 out of 270 wards where elections were held, the saffron party added muscle to its decade-long domination of the corporations effortlessly bucking anti-incumbency by riding on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
  

  

  The BJP's corporation-wise tally is: SDMC - 70, NDMC - 64 and EDMC - 47 as against AAP's tally of 16, 21 and 11 respectively. Congress finished last with 12, 15 and 3 wards.
  

  

  The BJP had won 138 wards in the last election.
  

  

  

  

  
  

  

  

  Modi expressed his gratitude+
  to the people of Delhi for reposing faith in the BJP and ensuring its resounding victory in the polls.
  

  

  
  ""I laud the hardwork of team @BJP4Delhi which made the resounding MCD win possible,"" he tweeted.
  

  

  In his first reaction, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised all cooperation to the civic bodies and refrained from commenting on EVMs, the alleged ""manipulation"" of which has been identified by him as the reason behind AAP's string of poll upsets.
  

  

  ""I congratulate BJP on their victory in all 3 MCDs. My govt looks forward to working wid MCDs for the betterment of Delhi (sic),"" Kejriwal, who went into a huddle with top leaders of the AAP as the results trickled in early in the day, tweeted.

  The victory is especially sweet for the BJP as it comes two years after it suffered a shock defeat in the Delhi assembly polls where a near-absolute majority had catapulted the AAP to the national stage.
  

  

  For the AAP, the rout comes after successive jolts in Punjab and Goa assembly polls and the Rajouri Garden assembly bypoll here and has led to murmurs of discontent in the party becoming louder.

  The opposition called it a ""referendum"" on the Kejriwal government and demanded that the CM resign.

"45","MCD Results 2017: BJP rides on Modi wave, AAP's political bubble bursts, say experts","NEW DELHI: While the Bharatiya Janata Party's landslide victory in the Delhi municipal polls can be credited to a ""Modi wave"", the Aam Aadmi Party's debacle signals the bursting of a political bubble, experts said on Wednesday.
  

  

  The director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Sanjay Kumar, believed that AAP's defeat would ""reduce its chances of survival"" as a political party.
  

  

  ""If you see AAP's report card in terms of state governance, the score isn't really bad. But the Modi wave helped the BJP garner more votes and register a historic win,"" he told PTI.
  

  

  ""Parties contest elections all the time; they win and they lose as well, it should not be too worrisome for them. But AAP's case is different,"" he said, referring to the fact that the party was formed barely four years ago on the strength of popular support.
  

  

  Kumar also said that since the poll results could not be seen as a ""referendum of AAP's work in governance at the state level"", the party needed to look into the reasons for defeat instead of blaming electronic voting machines (EVMs) for it.
  

  

  ""AAP must accept its defeat and go to the people to understand the reasons,"" he said.
  

  

  Kumar said the Delhi MCD elections were important for the three main political parties in the fray for different reasons.
  

  

  For the BJP, a victory would mark its return to the national capital. For the AAP, more seats would have ensured its political survival, while for the Congress, it would have meant a revival, he said.
  

  

  Kumar Rajesh, Fellow at Delhi University's Developing Countries Research Centre (DCRC), described AAP's slide as ""steep"" but predictable.
  

  

  ""While they entered Delhi's political scene with a bang the slide for AAP has been steep,"" he said.

  He added that the DCRC had conducted a survey in all the 272 wards of the MCD, interviewing nearly 40000 people for their views.
  

  

  ""The burst of the political bubble was predictable,"" he said. ""We can't deny that the BJP somehow managed to convince the voters that the party had been working for them,"" he added.
  

  

  The initial results show that the BJP has won 103 seats declared so far, while the AAP and Congress have bagged 26 and 8 seats respectively.
  

  

  The setback for AAP comes after its defeat in the Goa and Punjab assembly elections in March.","delhi-mcd"
"46","A Purabia who dons many hats and leaves his mark","NEW DELHIi: As he applauded his party's landslide in the Delhi municipal polls, BJP chief Amit Shah specifically mentioned Manoj Tiwari, the Bhojpuri singer-actor and member of Lok Sabha from Delhi northwest constituency.
  

  

  Shah must be feeling vindicated since it was he who, defying resistance and misgivings, picked Tiwari to lead the Delhi unit when it was reeling from the humiliation of 2015.
  

  

  Tiwari did not let Shah down. Though the first Bihari to head a unit dominated by Punjabis and Vaishyas and, on top of that, a late entrant to BJP, Tiwari plunged into the job with great gusto, coming up with populist moves like spending nights in slums as part of his effort to connect with a constituency which had powered AAP's rise.
  

  

  He was easily the most sought-after campaigner, addressing 243 meetings.
  

  

  He composed and gave his voice to the party's theme song ""Bhajpa dil mein, dil mein, bhajpa Dilli mein"" for the MCD polls. For someone who contested and lost the 2009 Lok Sabha elections on a Samajwadi Party ticket from Gorakhpur against UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Tiwari has indeed come a long way and his confidence showed through in the presser he held after the result.
  

  

  He made no bones about his identity of being a 'Purabia', a Bihari to be precise, as he chose to address the media in Bhojpuri, a clear indication that he wants to build upon the gains he has made among a burgeoning constituency which has established itself as an important factor in city politics.

  ""We have only seen negative politics in Delhi that attained a new low in the last two and a half years. Our first priority was to develop an atmosphere of positivity and we are grateful to the people of Delhi for responding to our call,"" Tiwari said.
  

  

  Being an acclaimed Bhojpuri singer with several hits like ""Jiya ho Bihar ke Lala"", ""Assiye se BA kaike, babua hamaar"" and also a popular actor in dozens of Bhojpuri films, Tiwari was chosen by the party top brass, a decision laced with the possibility of resentment among local leaders.
  

  

  Originally a resident of Atarwali village in Kaimur district of Bihar, Tiwari was one of the most sought after campaigners in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and also the recent assembly polls in UP and Uttarakhand thanks to his popularity as a singer and actor and also as a mature speaker.
  

  

  He had won the Lok Sabha polls just after joining the BJP and passing the baton to him had created much heartburn. However, Tiwari has successfully silenced his critics by the good show.","delhi-mcd"
"47","AAP nursery stands by party","NEW DELHI: Barely five feet tall, 31-year-old Vimlesh Koli is invisible at the centre of a joyous, raucous procession of AAP workers. ""Jhaduwale chha gaye"", they shout into the narrow lanes of Sunder Nagri in northeast Delhi. Her victory in the municipal election is some solace for the Aam Aadmi Party, which has been trounced by BJP in all three municipal corporations.
  

  

  Sunder Nagri is part of AAP's origin myth. This is where Arvind Kejriwal began his NGO Parivartan, did his high-visibility social audits and campaigns. Vimlesh Koli and her crew have been part of that movement, and stayed loyal to Kejriwal for two decades now. Born and raised in these slums, she has campaigned for ration cards, against water privatisation, for the inclusion of EWS children in private schools, against the 2013 gang rape that shook Delhi. Her comrades are equally fervent. ""AAP is my junoon (obsession)"", says 60-year-old Habisun Nisha, who also takes part in the procession. ""This is where Kejriwal and Anna Hazare began their fasts,"" she says.
  

  

  An AAP volunteer displays the results of Ward Sunder Nagri 33E, to show the party's emphatic victory over BJP, Congress and AIMIM. Its disappointing show elsewhere in the city doesn't dampen their joy.
  

  

  Gaurav Garg (25), son of former BJP councillor Kamlesh Garg who runs a big cloth shop, reels off his mother's achievements. Sunder Nagri has a significant Muslim population, of 55-60%, but she had goodwill here, he says. ""The main road has been made pucca, there's end-to-end closed drainage. Around 25 parks have been named, Hanuman Vatika, Abdul Kalam Vatika, Valmiki Vatika and so on. A couple of schools have been made into proper buildings. Three months ago, a ward office was set up for better coordination of services.""
  

  

  Nearly everyone here complains about how dirty the place is. ""Cleanliness depends on the public,"" says Garg. Even if the sanitation worker comes here, by mid-morning it is dirty, because people throw their peels and packets on the street. ""People here are largely illiterate,"" he says. Now that the seat is reserved for SCs and for a woman candidate, ""prabuddha log"" (enlightened people) could not emerge here, he claims.
  

  

  Meanwhile, the slums are still squalid, and many residents have their grouses against AAP. ""They worked best in that first 49-day government. They have slacked off since,"" says Pooran Singh. He is unemployed, though he wanted to be an engineer. He is not particularly inclined towards any party and despises politicians, but is willing to be proved wrong.
  

  

  ""We're not happy at all with AAP. She (Koli) might turn out okay, but the CM has just taken us for a ride,"" says Santoshi (who doesn't use a last name). She waves an electricity bill that she claims is double of what it used to be. Water has always been free here, that's no credit to AAP, she says. What she would like to see is a BJP government along the lines of Yogi Adityanath's in UP.
  

  

  Sunder Nagri is struggling for basic amenities, but identity issues are clearly simmering. Some, who favour BJP, even blame AAP for municipal matters, it had no control over, pointing to the open drains and the clouds of flies. ""We need development,"" says a local. Phool Singh (24) says that AAP should have installed the CCTV cameras it promised since women here often face harassment.
  

  

  Much of AAP's big talk about mohalla clinics and swanky schools has not materialised here. While schools have slowly improved over the years, nearly everyone complains about the public health centre and the nearby GTB hospital.

  Saligram, 70, is a BJP voter, but he's happy the AAP has won because he's started getting a pension of Rs 2,000. Municipal elections are about local issues, about the candidate's own appeal, community and all that. It's not about the party, like a Vidhan Sabha election is, he says.
  

  

  Even his defenders say that AAP's promises haven't panned out . ""Uske pair jame nahin hain. He (Kejriwal) will work when he is fully settled, but BJP doesn't let him work,"" says Zamruddin Ansari, a wage labourer who says he has been in dire straits since the demonetisation decision. Others, like 50-year-old Mohammed Shabir, applaud him for having the ""jigra"" (courage) to speak truth to Modi.

""These colonies were settled by Indira Gandhi after the 71 war,"" says a Congress worker. It can still be wrested back, if the party chooses the right candidate who cares about the constituency, he claimed.
  

  

  In other words, there is a committed core of AAP loyalists in Sunder Nagri and surrounding areas. But there is also a clear, hot current that favours BJP, even in the slums, and the non-BJP vote will go wherever it is likely to matter most.

""It no longer remains a free and fair elections if we can't make an informed choice,"" Gupta added.

Yogesh Verma, the BJP candidate from Ashok Vihar termed it as a conspiracy. ""How can this happen after notification, after the campaigning is over?"" he said. Ashok Basoya, the complainant and Congress candidate for Ashok Vihar said that his complaint was based on difference between delimitation report and electoral rolls.

  The campaign was marked by high-pitched rhetoric with
  AAP trying to pin BJP down+
  on its record of running the three corporations for many years, but it seems that the latter successfully managed to counter any fallout of anti-incumbency. It showed all its sitting corporators the door and put Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision at the centre of its campaign. It also put AAP on the defensive by making it seem that this would be a referendum on Delhi government's performance. The results will show whether people bought that argument or not. BJP, however, has been jubilant over the exit polls which have given it a huge mandate.
  

  

  AAP made the big-ticket promise of scrapping property tax to sway voters besides highlighting how the insanitary conditions in the capital had led to the outbreak of malaria, dengue and chikungunya and that the BJP-administered corporations were responsible for that.

  In an interview, the Aam Aadmi Party leader also accused the Modi government of trying to cripple state governments not with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
  

  

  Saying he was ""100 per cent"" sure EVM tampering prevented an AAP victory in Punjab, Kejriwal told IANS in an interview that this would be tried on Sunday too in Delhi's municipal elections.
  

  

  He said there were three reasons he feared Electronic Voting Machine tampering on Sunday.
  

  

  ""One, pre-2006 EVMs without security features are being used in Delhi; two, these EVMs have no VVPATs; three, the EVMs are coming from Rajasthan (where he said EVMs were tampered with).
  

  

  ""The only way to fail EVM tampering is to vote for the AAP tomorrow in huge numbers... People must defeat the EVM tampering.""
  

  

  Kejriwal denied he was complaining about EVMs because the AAP lost the assembly elections in Punjab and Goa.
  

  

  ""We did not make these allegations earlier when BJP won in Maharashtra and Jharkhand. In the last four months, evidence is emerging of tampering... from Pune, Bhind, Dholpur, Punjab, UP.""
  

  

  He said the Election Commission's refusal to hold an independent investigation into any allegation had only increased the suspicion about EVMs.
  

  

  Kejriwal said the AAP would certainly respond if and when the poll panel invited it to check the EVMs.
  

  

  ""They have not invited anyone... Only stories are planted in the media. They first agreed to let us check the EVMs before the Delhi polls. Then they said they could be checked after the polls. Why not earlier?""
  

  

  Accusing the Modi government of doing ""everything to stop us from working"", the AAP leader said his party wasn't the sole victim of such vindictive politics.
  

  

  ""In the whole country, BJP seems to have just one aim: if people don't vote for them, they won't let the governments function... Be it Arunachal, Manipur, Goa... They break governments... they lure MLAs.
  

  

  ""The tragedy is people who do now what Bhajan Lal once did are being painted as 'master strategists' while the parties which lose MLAs are blamed for the situation.

  Kejriwal said the BJP-controlled municipal corporations had turned Delhi into a garbage dump in the last decade. ""Now they want to cover up their 10 years of failure and corruption in the name of Modi.""
  

  

  If the AAP won the municipal polls, ""we will start cleaning up Delhi on a war footing and we will make the city sparkle in just one year"", he said.
  

  

  ""House tax will go. And in less than three years, Delhi will be free of dengue and chikungunya.""

  ""We have provided voice to migrants from Bihar and eastern UP who were used not just by BJP and Congress but also by Arvind Kejriwal as fodder, but were denied a say in decision-making. JD(U) entered the fray because of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's desire to find space for those who have so far languished on the margins despite having enough numbers to influence the outcome,"" JD(U) general secretary Sanjay Jha said.

  Jha denied the suggestion that his party was just a ""nuisance factor"" and would achieve little beyond being a spoiler in a few seats where Poorvanchalis are preponderant. ""This is an arrogant assumption typical of those who have taken the Poorvanchalis for granted and continue to see politics through a prism which has been rendered irrelevant by change in Delhi's demography. Just wait for the result and you will see,"" said the JD(U) leader who was hand-picked by Nitish Kumar to oversee his party's campaign in Delhi.
  

  

  The party's ambition has been fuelled by its assessment that a huge chunk of Poorvanchalis — a sprawling constituency which played a big role in Kejriwal's landslide in the assembly polls — are angry with AAP for not reciprocating its support. These migrants from Bihar and eastern UP, so goes JD(U)'s calculation, are unlikely to vote for Congress or BJP because both gave them a raw deal.","delhi-mcd"
"112","Might of crores versus spirit of ‘ordinary’: Who’ll win?","NEW DELHI: It is a fight between Rs 50 crore and Rs 5,000. BJP candidate Rajpal Singh in Sriniwaspuri has assets worth Rs 50 crore, while independent candidate Gayatri Devi has a measly Rs 5,000 against her name. ""Devi will not even get 100 votes,"" declared Singh. The statement isn't borne of financial arrogance, only the lawyer's optimism as a veteran BJP activist with the advantage of having the prime minister to inspire voters with.
  

  

  However, 37-year-old Devi, who has studied only up to Class XII, remained unfazed. ""People do not vote for a moneyed man, only for those who help them,"" she countered. The social worker hopes to leverage her reputation as a social worker against Singh's rupees and his party at the hustings.
  

  

  Democracy can be quirky, slating billionaires on the same voting machine as humbly endowed rivals. Singh vs Devi for a place in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation is intriguing, but the richest in the fray is Geeta Yadav in Mehrauli. Contesting for an SDMC seat as an independent backed by Swaraj India, Yadav's affidavit puts her assets at Rs 84 crore, the highest among the 2,537 men and women aspiring to the corporation seats. Yadav's rival, BSP's Poonam, only has Rs 30,000 in cash and Rs 1,000 in a bank account though she has jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh and her husband, Rs 7 lakh.
  

  

  ""I may be the richest candidate, but my campaign style is very simple,"" claimed 46-year-old Yadav. ""My husband and I ride a scooter, and I have no paid helpers."" But it is a clever ploy, because the housewife-politician herself confided, ""Mehrauli's people are frustrated with candidates who come in big vehicles to seek votes and disturb them."" Yadav thinks she will win handsomely, not because of her money, but the voters' confidence in her, not to forget that Congress is hobbled by two rebel candidates and BJP is beset by infighting.

  Like Yadav, her rival Poonam, 36, too entered politics because of deep unhappiness over the non-existent civic services. ""My people are my assets,"" asserted Poonam, an uneducated, self-made woman who runs a boutique. She is assured that her involvement in social work will see her through.
  

  

  Some municipal seats have gaping financial disparities. In Sadar Bazar, Mohammad Usman, the Congress nominee with assets of Rs 57 crore, is taking on Naveen Sharma, an independent with a less than Rs 35,000. In Vishnu Garden, Congress candidate Dhanwant Chandela, worth Rs 55 crore, is tussling with a rival who has just Rs 7,000. And in Preet Vihar, the richest candidate has Rs 42 crore against one of his rivals' Rs 12,000.
  

  

  According to the Association of Democratic Reforms, there are 74 candidates who possess assets worth over Rs 10 crore, 106 candidates, over Rs 5 crore, and 517 candidates, over Rs 1 crore.
  

  

  At the other end of the spectrum, Priya Jha, independent candidate from Sant Nagar, and Sunita Gill, NCP candidate from Adarsh Nagar, do not have a single rupee to their name.","delhi-mcd"

  Most exit polls have predicted a clean sweep by BJP in the three corporations and poor show by AAP. Party sources said Kerjiwal's call for an agitation related to EVMs and the growing doubts over their reliability.
  

  

  ""Now if we lose on Wednesday....if the results are what was being said last night (referring to exit polls), toh hum eent se eent baja denge,"" Kejriwal is heard telling a meeting of partymen in a video clip uploaded on Twitter. AAP was born out of a movement and it will not hesitate to go back to its roots, he is heard saying in another clip.
  

  

  ""If such results come, then it would prove that manipulation has happened, like in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Pune, Mumbai, Bhind and Dholpur. We are the product of a movement. We are not here to enjoy the pleasures of power. We will return to the movement,"" he said.
  

  

  Kejriwal said more than winning or losing, he was bothered about the ""unabated tampering of EVMs"" across the country and ""betrayal"". He cited alleged instances of AAP getting barely two votes in villages in Punjab, ""even in places where people booed the Akalis out"".
  

  

  Party sources who were present at the meeting explained that his statement — ""eent se eent baja dengey"" — referred to an agitation on the lines of the anti-corruption movement on the issue of EVM tampering.

  While the India Today-Axis poll gave the BJP between 202 and 220 seats of the 272 up for grabs, the ABP News-CVoter poll gave it 218 seats.
  

  

  Both polls gave the BJP three-fourths majorities in each of the three corporations and suggested that AAP and Congress would finish up with fairly similar tallies in the region of 20-odd seats each.
  

  

  If the predictions are proved right, it would be a remarkable achievement for a party that was battling ten years of incumbency in the corporations and replaced all its corporators. It would also be a huge setback for AAP on its home turf.
  

  

  Coming on the back of a poor performance in Goa and a worse than expected showing in Punjab, it would raise the question of whether the fledgling party has run out of steam after a stunning performance in the 2015 assembly polls.
  

  

  The India Today poll forecast that the BJP would win 78-84 seats in the 104-member North corporation, 79-85 in the 104-member South and 45-51 of the East's 64. It put the Congress neck and neck in the North with 8-12 seats each and the AAP perhaps marginally ahead of the Congress in the South and East.
  

  

  Overall, it predicted 19-31 seats for Congress and 23-35 for AAP.

Exercising her civic right for the first time in her life, the 19-year-old had queued up with the goodly crowd to vote in the municipal elections. But her mood turned glum when the polling officers turned her away at the polling booth. ""I have my voter ID card and I was looking forward to casting my first ever vote today,"" the crestfallen Yaseen told TOI.
  

  

  Yaseen's name was missing from the electoral rolls. The first timer might have been thwarted, but like Pawan Chaudhary, she will realise soon enough that people often find themselves disenfranchised for no apparent reasons.
  

  

  Chaudhary, 60, has voted in almost every election. On Sunday too, he walked to the MCD Primary School in Mallikpur to elect the corporator from the GTB Nagar ward. His daughters, Richa and Juhi, were with him. Once there, he found to his dismay that his name was not on the voters' list
  

  

  ""It will be the first time of my life that I did not vote,"" said Chaudhary, resident of Q Block, Model Town. Richa and Juhi were, however, able to press the EVM button.
  

  

  ""In the electoral roll, someone named Gautam Kumar was entered in the slot where my father's name should have appeared,"" said Juhi. The three checked the list of deleted voters, but Chaudhary's name did not appear there either.
  

  

  In the Jama Masjid ward, Rizwan Ahmad similarly found he was not listed as a voter, leaving him wondering, ""I know that names are deleted when the voter dies, but am I not still alive?"" Ahmad argued with the polling personnel, who pleaded helplessness. He had braved the heat to come out around noon to vote, and returned home a downcast citizen.

  If Chaudhary and Ahmad could think of no reason why their names should have been precluded from the electoral rolls, the mother-son duo of Sharda and David Robert reached Deshbandhu College in Kalkaji only to find that though they had got the change of address recorded with the election authorities and had even been given the voter slip by local volunteers, the official list contained no mention of them. ""Our votes have been made worthless by someone else's error,"" said the mother.
  

  

  Noor Nishan, resident of Shaheen Bagh, couldn't nearly vote too. Polling agents told the bemused Nishan that she had already voted. ""I have only now come to cast my vote,"" pleaded Nishan, showing her unmarked left-hand ring finger.
  

  

  On checking back, the agents realised that they had ticked her name instead of the one above her in the rolls. They cross-checked with the signature register and realised the clerical error. ""Had this fact not been brought to our notice, a vote would have been missed,"" said Parvez Alam Khan, the Congress candidate.

Who is responsible for water supply, electricity supply and maintaining sewage system? Answer the public, don't threaten them,"" read the boards at major intersections of the city.
  

  

  Kuljeet Singh Chahal, BJP general secretary, said this party had commissioned these hoardings in response to those put up by AAP claiming that BJP would increase the rates of water and electricity if it was elected to the three civic bodies. ""Misinformation is being spread and people are being virtually threatened,"" alleged Chahal. ""We are asking AAP to respond to the public, not to threaten them.""
  

  

  AAP's campaign has largely centred on its success in providing cheap electricity and free water, while promising the waiver of residential property tax. At every poll meeting, AAP leaders emphasised how the party had delivered on its promise to cut electricity rate by half and to waive charges on water up to 20,000 litres per month.
  

  

  Following its unexpectedly poor performance in the Rajouri Garden assembly by-polls, AAP had announced on billboards placed at Geeta Colony, Khajuri Chowk, Bhajanpura, Akshardham, Mayur Vihar Extension and some other places that if the saffron party won the civic polls, it would increase the rate of water and electricity charges. ""To stop this, vote for Kejriwal,"" the hoardings exhorted. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had reiterated these charges at an election rally in Burari. ""Do not vote for BJP, otherwise you will stop getting free water and cheap electricity,"" the CM had said.

  ""As per an internal survey conducted with a sample size of 52,000 voters in 13,000 polling booths, Congress will win 208 wards among a total of 272 in three municipal corporations,"" Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken said in a press conference here.
  

  

  He hit out at BJP and AAP, accusing them of running a ""negative"" campaign instead of suggesting solutions to the problems faced by the people.
  

  

  He said hoardings of both the parties, instead of highlighting their achievements, are focusing on opponents and charges against them.
  

  

  ""Arvind Kejriwal started this trend, but the people of Delhi want to know what parties can do for them and what have they done,"" he said.
  

  

  However, Congress has come out with road maps on sanitation, primary health and education, financial self reliance of municipal bodies, with an aim to solve the problems once voted to power, he said.

  ""We request the people to vote for positive governance. Making use of the best brains in the party, we have made seven road maps for the development of Delhi,"" he said.
  

  

  39 top leaders of the party, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Shashi Tharoor, Oscar Fernandes, Bhoopinder Singh Hooda, Salman Khursheed, Raj Babbar among others campaigned for the Congress in different parts of the city.
  

  

  The All India Congress Committee (AICC) had appointed 70 Assembly observers and 14 district observers for the MCD elections.

"121","EVM snags make AAP, Swaraj India cry foul","NEW DELHI: Electronic voting machines suffered snags at various polling booths on Sunday, which resulted in AAP and debutant Swaraj India crying foul.
  

  

  Voting was halted for over half an hour when one of three EVMs at a polling booth in Chandni Chowk stopped functioning. ""When the button next to the BJP symbol was pressed, it didn't return to normal. The snag was rectified after 30 minutes,"" said a policeman who didn't wish to be named.
  

  

  Elsewhere at Ashok Vihar, a non-functional EVM halted polling at a police colony booth. It was quickly replaced, though.
  

  

  ""In 2015, I voted at the same booth but the EVM looked new. The one today looked old and worn out due to overuse,"" said one Sanjay Tiwari.
  

  

  At Shaheen Bagh, there were several complaints related to booth management at polling station number 29. From EVMs malfunctioning to booths being unmarked, officials gave a range of explanations.
  

  

  Parvez Khan, a local candidate present at the polling station, said, ""Polling here started an hour late due to problems with EVMs and the staff being poorly trained. On top of it, the rooms were poorly marked so people didn't know which room to go to.""
  

  

  The returning officer blamed poor electricity supply for voting starting late. But he insisted that there was a delay of only 15-20 minutes.
  

  

  A source said voting was stopped for around an hour at Kadipur school in Burari ward.

  There were heated arguments between Swaraj India volunteers and ADM. At a polling booth in Mayur Vihar, an EVM was dysfunctional. Apparently, button number 7 that's allotted to Swaraj India didn't return to normal after being pressed.
  

  

  ""When the voters brought this to the notice of the presiding officer, he advised them to press some other button. The candidate requested the presiding officer to lodge a complaint. He refused to do it,"" Swaraj India said in a written complaint to the state election commission.

But around 70% of them were resolved immediately while legal action has been initiated against just 5%, said the police.

  The police had to intervene in a scuffle in Ambedkar Nagar where a political leader alleged that she was attacked by some people.
  

  

  A police team was also put on standby following reports of firing outside a booth in the Bindapur area of southwest Delhi. However, the call was found to be bogus. Around the evening, a candidate from Rohini alleged that he was beaten up by goons outside his house. The police are probing his claim.
  

  

  According to the police data, 127 calls about various issues related to polling booths were received from Rohini alone. A senior official said most of the calls were from members of political parties who complained about defective EVMs, distribution of money and liquor by opposition parties and bogus voting.
  

  

  A multi-layer security arrangement was put in place at 13,022 booths — 197 hypersensitive and 575 sensitive — located in 770 buildings. Besides 56,256 Delhi Police personnel, 40 companies of paramilitary forces and 20,000 home guards were deployed.

"123","Capital contest: Polls to local bodies, but interest is national","NEW DELHI: The stage is set for one of the mostly keenly anticipated
  municipal polls in the capital+
  on Sunday after a hard and bitterly fought campaign pitted BJP, AAP and Congress in a triangular fight.
  

  

  Smaller outfits like the Janata Dal (U), BSP and Swaraj India further spiced up the electoral broth. But one reason why this local contest has sparked national interest is that the BJP campaign sought to cash in on PM Modi's popularity and ""good governance"" promise while there is intense interest in whether AAP holds onto its home turf.
  

  

  Coming just a little more than a month after
  BJP's big success in UP+
  and it's more recent
  win in the Rajouri Garden assembly bypoll+
  , the party is tipped as the front runner despite a two-term incumbency in Delhi's three municipal bodies.
  

  

  The stakes are no less significant for AAP that will hope to reverse a losing streak following a
  disappointing show in Goa and Punjab+
  . For Congress, encouraged by a second place finish in Rajouri Garden, the challenge is to retain the momentum.
  

  

  Interestingly, the civic election is being perceived as much a referendum on AAP's record in office as it is about BJP in the backdrop of an acrimonious row over funding and powers of civic bodies.
  

  

  The campaign has been marked by defections, primarily from Congress to BJP, as the latter seeks to embellish its winning credentials. BJP leaders, however, expect a tough contest as the party changed its candidates, opting for relatively inexperienced newcomers.
  

  

  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has
  campaigned vigorously+
  and AAP faces a crucial test two years past its term in office. A revival will energise the party and indicate that its base of less privileged voters is with it while a poor finish can widen the internal fissures that defeats in Goa and Punjab brought to the surface. Over 1.3 crore people are eligible to vote on Sunday, with predictions of cooler weather raising prospects of a better turnout.
  

  

  The contest will see 270 seats across three municipal corporations of Delhi going to polls. The total number of candidates has gone up slightly this time when compared to the 2012 poll, with 2,537 contesting. Poll officials are, however, keeping fingers crossed for a higher voter turnout.
  

  

  In 2012, municipal polls saw a record breaking turnout with 58% of the total voters casting their votes. Police and state election commission have not left anything to chance with the deployment of over 56,000 personnel drawn from central paramilitary forces, home guards and different units of Delhi Police to ensure peaceful, fair and free elections.

  A few units have been kept in reserve, in case required. Despite aggressive opposition from AAP, the polls would be held on EVMs and voters have been asked not to carry mobile phones inside the polling booths. More than the civic issues, the election has been fought on allegations and counter allegations but the parties have promised moon to the voters. Now it's the time for the voters to decide which party convinced them the most.
  

  

  AAP has brushed aside the unfavourable Rajouri Garden bypoll results and ruled out any reflection of this in the civic elections. Political observers think the civic poll is a referendum on the work of AAP-led Delhi government and a litmus test for CM Arvind Kejriwal.
  

  

  Under Kejriwal's leadership, AAP has come out with a strong manifesto promising clean and corruption-free Delhi like other parties. BSP has fielded 196 candidates, less than 250 candidates it had fielded in 2012. To fill the political vacuum JD (U), which contested on around a dozen seats in 2012, has fielded 91 candidates. The 211 candidates fielded by Swaraj India will be considered as Independent candidates as the party is yet to be recognised by the EC.
  

  

  With 29 candidates from Samajwadi Party and other small parties might take a huge bite of the vote share of key players (BJP, Congress, AAP) in their quest to make their mark in the civic polls. A mock poll will be conducted to ensure all EVMs are working properly and poll officials claimed that they have kept EVMs in reserve in case any machine malfunctions. Polling for two wards - Maujhpur and Sarai Pipal --has been postponed due to the death of contesting candidates. For Maujhpur ward, polls will be held on May 14 and Sarai Pipal on May 21.","delhi-mcd"

  ""If you vote for the BJP and if your child falls prey to chikunngya or dengue, you are responsible for it. I can offer free treatment to your child in (the Delhi government) hospitals, but what led to him contracting dengue.

"126","Some Muslim voters back in Congress fold","NEW DELHI: The Muslim community had played a big part in the Aam Aadmi Party's astounding triumph in the assembly elections of 2015. However, Wednesday's municipal poll results seemed to indicate that the community may have partly reverted to Congress, the party they traditionally support.
  

  

  Wards with Muslims making up more than 40% of the voters did not all return AAP candidates, with the votes being shared by AAP and Congress.
  

  

  Many Muslim voters admitted that AAP's promises had not enthused them this time. ""The promise of property tax waiver, for instance, was of little importance to many Muslims who mostly live in unauthorised colonies where these taxes are not applicable,"" said a resident of Zakir Nagar.
  

  

  AAP, however, maintained that it was wrong to say its Muslim support was migrating. Amanatullah Khan, AAP MLA from Okhla, in fact, accused the other parties of deceit to win over Muslim voters.
  

  

  ""Many poor Muslim jhuggi dwellers were given bribes a day before the polls,"" Khan claimed. He also asserted that the voting machines had been ""managed"" to transfer votes to Congress.
  

  

  Congress, for its part, believed that not only Muslims, but most poor sections of society had shifted loyalties to the party. ""AAP was voted to power by these sections, which now feels betrayed because it has not fulfilled the promises it has made to them,"" declared Farhad Suri, Congress leader and former leader of the Opposition in the south corporation.

  BJP too claimed that the Muslims had lost faith in Arvind Kejriwal. ""AAP has done no work in Muslim-majority areas since coming to power,"" opined Atif Rashid, Delhi BJP's Minority Morcha president. BJP itself could not boast of a single victory from the five seats where it had nominated Muslim candidates. However, Rashid maintained that BJP had gained the support of Muslims ""as is evident from the increase in our vote share in the five Muslim-majority wards"".
  

  

  Rashid also claimed that most Pasmanda, or lower-caste Muslims, had cast their lot with BJP. ""
  

  

  We gave tickets to five Pasmanda candidates. This instilled confidence in the Muslim community,"" said Rashid. AAP's Khan countered this by pointing out that there was ""no such thing as a Pasmanda or an Ashrafi voting for BJP"". ""No Muslim will ever vote for BJP,"" Khan asserted.
  

  

  While the BJP's Muslim candidates had expressed the hope that Muslims would vote in the saffron party's favour because it believed that divorce through triple talaq was not socially just, Rashid differed and said the party's stand on the custom had not played a role in the polls. ""Triple talaq is a social issue, and people voted only on the basis of local issues,"" concluded Rashid.","delhi-mcd"
"127","With inked fingers, youth set agenda","NEW DELHI: The first-time voters — some of them past their teens but exercising their franchise for the first time — were an enthusiastic lot on Sunday as Delhi turned out to decide who will run the three corporations in the city for the next five years. While for many of them it was like a rite of passage and an assertion of their right as a citizen, some were quite focused on the issues that ought to be tackled by the new corporations.
  

  

  Sanitation was identified as a top concern, cutting across economic backgrounds and class. From open drains to dirty roads and unfinished civil works, these voters had a set of concrete demands.
  

  

  Simran, a 20-year-old resident of Laxmi Nagar, said her main concern was cleanliness in the city. ""I have voted for a party which I think will focus on keeping the city clean,"" she said, without revealing her choice. Similarly, Tamanna, a 20-year-old from Kalkaji Extension, complained that the drains in her area were always overflowing. ""I will vote for whoever can deal with the sanitation problem,"" she told TOI, still unsure of the candidate while standing in the queue to cast her vote.
  

  

  Ismat Jahan, a 24-year-old from Trilokpuri, was seeking redressal of her grievances, a councillor ""who would heed our complaints."" Originally from Allahabad, she had shifted to Delhi after getting married. Voting for the first time, she observed that the lack of coordination on completion of civil works had become the capital's bane. ""They had dug up our lane to repair the sewer line but they took many days to do the repair work though we complained several times,"" she said.

  However, there were many youngsters out in the heat, armed with their ID cards, who had turned up just for the experience. They took selfies and enthusiastically posed for photographs, showing their inked fingers. Lakshmi Tiwari, a resident of Nanakpura, said: ""I was encouraged by my sister who is enrolled in the paramilitary forces. She always tells me the importance of taking a stand and exercising my right as a voter which is why I came here"". Her sister, Roli Singh, who had accompanied her to the polling booth, said it was extremely important for the younger generation to participate in the electoral process.
  

  

  A student, Charu Goel, from Karol Bagh looked thrilled. She said she had always wanted to vote and was proud to have finally taken the step after turning 18. ""I believe that if anyone wants to voice their opinion on politics, they must do so after casting their vote and fulfilling their duty as a responsible citizen,"" said Goel. She added that she was a supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that he had inspired her to cast her vote.
  

  

  There were some first-timers though who were unaware of the the exact role of the corporations. Jyoti Das, a 20-year-old from Chittaranjan Park, said her main concern was the lack of cash in ATMs and she wanted someone to address that. ""Students from outside Delhi find it very difficult to function without cash. We have to stand in queues outside ATMs which most of the time don't have money,"" she complained. Simran of Laxmi Nagar confessed that she was not aware of the functions of the municipal corporations but had come to vote nevertheless.
  

  

  The enthusiasm of the youngsters was palpable. Priya Negi , a 19-year-old from Burari, said had she asked her friends to also vote this time as the next generation should develop a habit of casting votes. ""A lot of us skip elections thinking our vote won't make a difference but it does. All of us should vote,"" said Negi.","delhi-mcd"

  But things weren't all smooth for many such voters. At CR Park, Pragya Deora, a 26-year old PhD scholar, had to rely on her sense of touch to select the button on the EVM. ""They had no Braille voting sheets,"" she informed. ""An official read out the order of candidates and told me to count the buttons to select my choice.""
  

  

  At Shaheen Bagh, Mohammed Imitiaz had to brave more than the afternoon sun to reach the polling booth. He looked lost and hassled as he made his way past the uneven schoolground, with no signage or volunteers to assist him. He bore this stoically, insisting, ""I have to vote no matter what the circumstances.""
  

  

  Many voters complained about the lack of wheelchairs and ramps for the disabled. At Sant Nirankari School, wheelchair-bound Alakh Ram made a painful way to the EVM, though he too remained defiant, saying, ""There is no option if you want the right person who can solve the locality's problems."" In Nanakpura, Jayanti Talwar was irked to find that her brother in his wheelchair could not negotiate the stairs to reach the booth. ""This polling station was not in the least disabled-friendly,"" she grumbled.
  

  

  One voting venue in Vasant Kunj was a pleasant exception, however, with two wheelchairs there for the use of voters. Officials at some stations allowed the elderly and disabled to cut to the front of the queues to spare them inconvenience. At Pitampura, officials even allowed such voters to drive to the polling stations.","delhi-mcd"
"129","Low-income colonies saw high turnout","NEW DELHI: Though the capital registered a record turnout in the municipal elections with 53.53% of voting, data for the 270 municipal wards show that the poll percentage was relatively lower in the upscale and middle-class wards than outer Delhi, slums and unauthorised colonies. This indicates that the city's periphery wants it to be heard. The outcome of the civic polls could also reflect the sentiment of a growing migrant population, which is redefining the social profile of the city.
  

  

  The 104 wards in south and north corporations recorded a total of 51.5% and 54.1% of voting respectively, while the east civic body witnessed the highest turnout — 56.05%. Voting figures released by the state election commission show that affluent localities like Greater Kailash, Vasant Kunj, Preet Vihar, Patparganj, Kalkaji and Chittaranjan Park — where RWAs are quite active — were lagging behind when compared to the residents in their neighbouring slums.
  

  

  Areas which recorded 60% and above polling either fall in outer Delhi or belong to unauthorised colonies and slum clusters. The voter turnout in majority of the wards with upscale colonies remained below 50%. For instance, the Greater Kailash ward recorded only 42.4% of voting while the Bhati ward, which comprises slum and rural areas, recorded 65% of polling. Dwarka A, which is a model ward and a home to upper middle-class population, recorded only 40.8% of polling. The turnout in other urban wards like RK Puram, Lajpat Nagar, Hauz Khas, Safdarjung Enclave, Munirka, Malviya Nagar and Defence Colony was below 50%. Vasant Vihar and Vasant Kunj had 46.7% and 45.2% of voting respectively.
  

  

  Similarly, in old Delhi, which has densely populated wards like Chandni Chowk, witnessed 49.71% turnout but wards like Bakhtawarpur in north Delhi recorded the highest with 68.78% voting. In 2012, Bakhtawarpur had the highest share of voter turnout—68%. Affluent areas like Civil Lines and Rajinder Nagar witnessed 49.7% and 48.61% turnout respectively.

Areas like Mayur Vihar, Patparganj and Preet Vihar just crossed the 50% mark. Shakurpur was the only ward to have a turnout below 50%.

  Justice A K Pathak said an order for use of VVPAT (Voter-verified paper audit trail)-enabled Generation 2 or Generation 3 electronic voting machines (EVBMs) cannot be issued at the eleventh hour as it would amount to stalling the election process.
  

  

  The plea, filed by the AAP as also by Mohd Tahir Hussain who is a candidate in the MCD elections, has contended that the EVMs to be used in the polls were obsolete and open to tampering.
  

  

  During the arguments before dismissing the plea, the court asked the state election commission of Delhi why it did not opt for VVPAT EVMs in view of the Supreme Court's observation in Subramanium Swamy's case that such machines should be brought into use in a phased manner.

"131","Smaller players bet big on their poll chances","NEW DELHI: Even as Congress, BJP and AAP have been getting the maximum political footage this municipal election, there are other smaller players that have been slowly but steadily trying to grab a bite of the poll pie.
  

  

  JD(U), Swaraj India, BSP and SP are the more well-known among these smaller players, but there are some nondescript parties that are contesting too. Their size hasn't prevented them from aiming big, though. They have projected themselves as alternatives to the three bigger parties by holding many rallies, public meets and road shows.
  

  

  Yogendra Yadav's Swaraj India will make its electoral debut. But it has not been a smooth ride for the debutante, as it was denied a common election symbol followed by rejection of nomination of 24 candidates. Its candidates are contesting on 211 seats with women candidates fighting on 111 seats. Contesting as Independent, the candidates have got a common symbol of whistle.
  

  

  Swaraj India ran a high-pitched campaign, attacking all parties for their failure in delivering on promises. The party says that local issues have been central to its election campaign. ""Unlike other political parties, we have focused on local issues. We have presented our vision document before the people,"" said Anupam, spokesperson of Swaraj India.
  

  

  JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar invoked the issue of full statehood to Delhi to attract Delhi voters while appealing to Bihari pride at the same time. JD(U) has fielded mostly Poorvanchalis. Even though the Bihar-based party doesn't have a strong foothold in Delhi, it has mounted a strong campaign in Poorvanchali areas by bringing politicians from Bihar.

  ""The crowd at Nitish Kumar rallies and road shows indicated that we are going to win big,"" claimed Sanjay Jha, JD(U) general secretary and Delhi in-charge. JD(U) has fielded 101 candidates—50% of them women—many of whom are Poorvanchalis.
  

  

  BSP has bigger stakes than JD(U) as it has 11 councillors at present. It has fielded 211 candidates across the corporations. The party's Delhi in-charge, Veerendra Singh Ashok, claimed BSP candidates have worked silently and the results would be big bang.
  

  

  Caste equations have been at play too. BSP has fielded 22 Brahmins, four Rajputs, 26 Muslims besides a significant number of Dalits and other castes. ""We have given representation to people from all castes and creed,"" Ashok said, adding that 120 of its candidates are women. However, BSP has had no popular campaigners.

"132","Why the south Delhi rich are poor in casting their ballot","NEW DELHI: It is a paradox: the affluent residential colonies that are more robustly covered by the RWA system are often the least interested in casting votes for the municipal corporations. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that residents of these colonies have the wherewithal to deal with civic problems even if the corporations ignore their complaints. In 2012, the burgeoning RWA movement had created a lot of interest in the civic bodies, and yet the turnout in these areas had been just around 45%. This Sunday, with the unusually hot weather and a general disillusionment with political parties, it would be interesting to watch the turnout in these areas.
  

  

  The voting percentage in the byelection for the Rajouri Garden assembly seat was 47%. That, however, can be attributed to a general trend in byelections. Wing Commander JS Chaddha (retd), who heads the RWA in East of Kailash and is the convenor of URJA (United Residents Joint Action), however, has doubts if the voters from the affluent colonies will turn up at the polling booths on Sunday. ""The problem is not about awareness but about the high level of frustration with the system,"" he said.

  Chetan Sharma, chairman of the Federation of GK2 RWAs, pointed out that in 2012 when the RWA movement was at a peak, the urban colonies had voted in greater numbers than earlier. Despite this, the turnout was less than 50%. ""The RWA movement has since got watered down, so it will definitely have an effect on this year's turnout,"" he said. He also attributed the lack of voter interest to the reluctance of the state election commission to involve the RWAs and citizen groups in election-related activities this time.
  

  

  The delimitation exercise, by geographically balancing the urban-rural presence in the wards, has further diluted the political relevance of votes from upscale colonies. Meena Gangahar, member of the Greater Kailash RWA, argued that the politicians considered jhuggi-jhopdi dwellers and urban villages as their vote banks. ""Our ward now has many JJ colonies and villages included in it. Their population provides the politicians with a reliable vote bank,"" she said. ""Why should we vote for leaders who will have nothing to do with our concerns?""
  

  

  Indeed, in 2012, the east Delhi region largely made up of unauthorised or regularised colonies and urban villages recorded the highest turnout. South Delhi, home to high-profile addresses, recorded the least. Perhaps the apathy also has to do with residents of affluent areas having access to power centres as well as the financial muscle to solve their problems with or without the intervention of their municipal councillor. ""People in the richer areas live in gated apartments where they have power back-up and private workers ensuring sanitary conditions. This parallel civic system is available to them,"" explained BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA Joint Front, who reiterated that turnout in the posher areas would be less than earlier this year.
  

  

  Responding to the RWAs' criticisms, Delhi State Election Commissioner SK Srivastava said that the commission ""had written to the RWAs that if they wished to, they could participate in helping the election commission staff in organising the polling"". The commission had even nominated staff to help RWAs disseminate information about the polling booths and election-related questions, he added.","delhi-mcd"

  The BJP was leading in 160 wards, the Congress in 45 and the AAP in 16 wards in the Delhi civic polls, according to early counting trends, Delhi State Election officials said on Wednesday.","delhi-mcd"
"134","Neglected areas vote loud and clear for change","NEW DELHI: In a historic turnout, the show was stolen by the city's poor and those who live on the peripheries of the urban centre. If Bakhtawarpur ward in Narela assembly constituency outdid everyone, registering the highest voter turnout of 69% among 270 wards, in a far corner of northeast Delhi, Sunder Nagri went all out to secure the second place and take the top slot in east with 63.62% .
  

  

  Sunder Nagri is the place from where chief minister Arvind Kejriwal led the RTI movement for the rights of the poor in the slums under the banner of Parivartan. The area is marked by a significant population living in slums. The highest overall turnout of about 56% registered in east Delhi too reveals that unauthorized colonies, resettlements and slums have come out strongly to have a say in the way the city will be run.
  

  

  In south, the highest turnout was registered in Madipur at 61.6%. Clearly, here too, the marginals may prove to be decisive with the voters living in unauthorized colonies, urban and rural villages and slums.
  

  

  Interestingly, in the Rajouri Garden ward, which is in the Rajouri Garden assembly constituency, the turnout was 48.83%. This assembly constituency saw a bypoll on April 9 with a low voter turnout of 47%. BJP won the seat.
  

  

  Tagore Garden, with a significant middle class presence, registered a turnout of 54.35% while in Punjabi Bagh it was 55.94%. On the periphery, Burari recorded 55.75%, Narela 56.22 % and Rohini 50.83%.
  

  

  Lack of sanitation and public toilets, poor quality of civic services and missing civic infrastructure seem to have forced people of east Delhi to turn out in large numbers and vote for ""change"".

  In the area's villages like Chilla and slum clusters in Trilokpuri, Mustafabad, Sunder Nagri, Shahdara etc, close to 25-30% votes were cast by noon and people stood in long queues waiting for their turn. ""This vote is for change. From public toilets to colony roads, everything is in a pathetic condition. In the past two years, we have suffered a lot due to the strike by sanitation workers. Why can't our areas be maintained like the south Delhi ones,"" asked Satprakash, a resident of Ramesh Park. However, in well-developed areas like Mayur Vihar and Patparganj, residents trickled in slowly through the day.
  

  

  For lakhs of sanitation workers employed with the three municipal corporations, the main issue was ""getting salary on time"". Mahesh Kumar, a sanitation worker with the east corporation, said that he had to pull out his children from a private school and admit them in a government school as he couldn't pay the fees on time. ""I paid a fine for one year, but now I can't afford to do that. For the past two years, we have not been getting salaries on time. I want a party in corporation which can ensure that sanitation workers get salaries on time,"" said Kumar, a resident of Trilokpuri.
  

  

  Meanwhile, the upscale colonies of south Delhi warmed up to the process very slowly. A polling centre in Deshbandhu College at Kalkaji had 8% turnout till 10 am. A similar general sense of apathy was visible in the affluent localities lke GK1, GK2 and CR Park in the morning. Polling officers at CR Park's B Block polling station said they recorded an 11.5% turnout in the first two hours. In stark contrast, the neighbouring Govindpuri and Okhla had hundreds of people waiting outside polling stations to get their voter slips prepared.
  

  

  In minority-dominated areas like Okhla's Shaheen Bagh, too, there was an impressive turnout as people - including many women -- continued to pour in even in the afternoon. A few yards from the historic Red Fort in Jama Masjid ward, too, many Muslim women came out to cast their vote.","delhi-mcd"

  ""Even the election commissioner praised us yesterday. Voting has now become a part of our culture,"" says Om Prakash, 51, a farmer, displaying his ink-marked finger. It becomes clear after TOI spoke with several locals that caste linkages play a key role in the high turnout in this ward comprising over a dozen villages with 55,000 voters. Bakhtawarpur is the big gest village in the ward and located at the centre. Bhule Ram Chauhan, 70, an ex-serviceman and former pradhan, says that enthusiasm and interest for elections has always been a unique feature of the area.
  

  

  ""Even when I contested in 1983, a huge percentage of peo 1983, a huge percentage of people voted. I remember even a pregnant lady was carried to the booth on a cot. It is largely because of the community feeling here. The village has a large number of Chauhans and all families are like relatives in an extended family .And if you don't vote, it becomes a matter of ulahana (grouse),"" he says.
  

  

  Locals estimate that Chauhans make at least 50% of the population. Jats are second in number. Much of the voting happens on caste lines. The previous two councillors from the Bakhtawarpur seat, Rita and Sharad, were Chauhans too. Even this year, all major parties -AAP , Congress and BJP -fielded Chauhans as candidates. Says BJP candidate Sunit Chauhan, ""My ri vals from AAP and Congress are close relatives. Brotherhood has kept Bakhtawarpur a notch above the other areas.""

  Shahid Saifi, 48, a resident from neighbouring village Akbarpur Majra, says intercaste rivalry is also a strong factor in every election. ""The alluvial Yamuna khadar region has a large number of Chauhans and Jats. Both communities want their candi date to win and cajole a large number of people to turn out.Political parties here are irrelevant. Caste is the defining factor. The last councillor belonged to the BSP even though party doesn't have much pres ence in this ward. He was a Chauhan too,"" he says.
  

  

  Largely an agricultural village, Bakhtawarpur has lush green fields. Despite being located in a distant corner of the capital near the Delhi UP-Haryana border, the basic civic infrastructure seems to be in place. Vehicle ownership too is high. Electrician Rajesh Kumar explains how vehicles were roped in to ferry people to the booths.

  ""People in posh urban areas don't even know their neighbours. Here even the marriage invitation goes out to the entire village. The whole family goes out to vote together making the turnout really high,"" he says.
  

  

  Bakhtawarpur, though, continues to have some basic problems. One of them is the absence of a proper healthcare facility . The drainage system too is inadequate.

"145","MCD polls: Officials to get memos for delay in sending data","NEW DELHI: Irked over the delay in sending polling percentages by the officials concerned, the State Election Commission (SEC) has decided to issue memos to them.
  

  

  SEC officials had a hard time compiling the polling percentages at regular intervals as there was a delay in receiving the data from the polling centres.
  

  

  ""There was a delay on the part of the officials concerned in sending the polling percentage data to the control room set up at the SEC headquarters. It has been decided to issue memos to those responsible for it,"" said an official.
  

  

  SEC officials suspect that poor Internet connectivity at the polling centres led to the delay in transmitting the data to the control room.
  

  

  ""There could have been issues with the Internet at the returning officers' end. Such a problem had never surfaced before,"" said an official.
  

  

  Voting to elect the municipal councillors commenced at over 13,000 polling stations across the national capital at 8 AM amid tight security arrangements.

  For the first time, the 'None Of The Above' (NOTA) option was made available in the MCD polls.
  

  

  A total of 1,32,10,206 voters, including over 1.1 lakh first-time voters, were entitled to exercise their franchise to elect councillors for the 270 wards under the three civic bodies -- NDMC (103 wards), SDMC (104) and EDMC (63).

  civic polls in Delhi+
  .
  

  

  In most upscale colonies, the turnout was very low till 11am. For instance, in some polling stations in Mayur Vihar phase-I, the turnout was 10-12% whereas it was close to 25% in the neighbouring Chilla village by noon.
  

  

  Santosh, a resident of Trilokpuri, said it was a much-needed election as there had been no development in the area for several years. ""Sanitation is a serious problem here. People want change. We want someone who can address our problem,"" she said.
  

  

  In upscale south Delhi colonies like Greater Kailash I and II, Vasant Kunj, Panchsheel Enclave, Safdarjung Enclave and Vasant Vihar, residents trickled in slowly through the day. In a stark contrast to this, Govindpuri, a slum cluster near GK, had hundreds of people waiting outside the polling station at Sant Nirankari school to get their voter slips. ""It is just 11am and we have already seen 20% of polling,"" an election official said.
  

  

  People in JJ clusters, slums and unauthorised colonies complained that the problems in their areas were very serious and councillors had done little to address them in the past few years. ""Maximum campaigning happens in our areas, but when it comes to work nobody listens to us,"" said Manoj Vajpayee, a resident of Ramesh Park in east Delhi.

  Ram Kishan, a resident of Govindpuri, has similar grievances. ""Only 10% of houses here have toilets. Women have to go to the nearby jungles to relieve themselves. We don't have regular supply of water. We need a strong councillor to address our problems. People in Greater Kailash and other posh areas can straightaway call the officers if they have slightest of discomfort. But no one will listen to us,"" said Ram Kishan.
  

  

  North Delhi areas like Civil Lines witnessed a poor voter turnout even till 3pm whereas in Burari and Mangolpuri, which have a high percentage of rural pockets and slums, people turned up in large numbers to vote for a ""change"". Voters said these areas were facing a number of civic problems and the elections were a good way to improve the condition and tell political parties that they can't run away from their responsibilities. ""The voter turnout has been very good despite the heat. Over 17% had cast their votes by 11am,"" said an official at a polling station in Burari.
  

  

  Areas like Khyala saw a high voter turnout while poll percentage was dismal in places like Rajouri Garden, Tagore Garden and Karol Bagh. ""Sanitation has always been a problem and we want to vote for candidate who looks promising and can solve the issues of our ward,"" said Raju, a resident of Khyala.
  

  

  In many upscale colonies, people didn't come out to cast vote as they believed this election results won't affect them. Sushila Rawat came to vote around 2pm in Dhaula Kuan. An MNC employee, Rawat blamed the heat for the below average turnout in the afternoon.","delhi-mcd"

However, amid the excitement anxiety was writ large on the faces of AAP and Congress given the fact that exit polls have given a clean sweep to BJP.
  

  

  Tiwari took the opportunity of the two-day gap between polling and counting to fly to Mumbai and shoot a movie. He returned on Tuesday morning to take stock of the preparations of the state unit for the counting day. He met party members at his North Avenue residence and then went to Parliament to attend a meeting of standing committee on shipping.
  

  

  A cricket enthusiast, Tiwari played the sport in the lawn of his residence in the evening to relax and prepare for the civic poll results that may shape his political career in the party.
  

  

  Ajay Maken spent the day conducting meetings. He met district presidents to get their feedback on the municipal elections. In the evening, he met Congress spokespersons and advised them to keep the party's position in the media strongly on Wednesday.
  

  

  The exit polls have not been favourable for Congress. Aspiring to make a comeback in the corporations, the party came up with a detailed manifesto and roped in senior party functionaries in campaigns. It fielded many new faces and gave an impressive representation to women.

  Though the party had to fight defections, it always put up a strong face before the public. The results will show whether Congress maintains the growth in voting percentage it received during the Rajouri Garden bypoll or loses the momentum.
  

  

  Kejriwal met party functionaries at his residence to discuss the civic polls. He expressed apprehension that EVMs may spoil AAP's prospects and threatened to launch an agitation if the outcome of the polls was what the exit polls have suggested.

"148","BJP to sweep Delhi civic elections, predict 2 surveys","NEW DELHI: Two opinion polls on the eve of the
  municipal polls+
  in Delhi have projected a
  sweep for the BJP+
  in all three corporations, with one giving the party that is now in office 195 out of the 272 seats and the other 179. The two polls placed AAP at a distant second at 55 and 45 seats respectively and the Congress even further back.
  

  

  While the poll done by VMR for Times Now did not give a break-up of its seat projection for the three corporations, its tally of 195 for the BJP clearly implies comfortable wins in all three. The CVoter poll done for ABP News forecast that the BJP would win 76 of the 104 seats in the North corporation, 60 of 104 in the South and 43 of 64 in the East.

  AAP, this poll estimated, would win 13 seats in the North, 21 in the South and 11 in the East. The Times Now poll put the Congress tally for all three corporations combined at just 15, while the ABP News poll gave it 26 seats consisting of eight each in the North and East and 10 in the South.
  

  

  The ABP News poll gave the BJP a vote share of 41.9%, which would mean a near repeat of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. For AAP, the projected 27.5% in this poll would mean a massive comedown from the nearly 55% it won in the 2015 assembly polls.
  

  

  Interestingly, both polls suggested that the decisive mandate for BJP would be despite a high level of dissatisfaction with the performance of the corporation in the last ten years when the party has been in office. The Times Now poll estimated that the satisfaction levels with the Delhi government are higher than with MCD.
  

  

  This seems to vindicate the BJP's strategy of fighting these elections primarily in the name of the prime minister and points to a failure by AAP and Congress to get voters focused on municipal issues and the perceived non-performance of the corporations.","delhi-mcd"

BJP claimed that the step confirmed that ""Congress is disintegrating"" in the city.
  

  

  After pledging his unconditional support to BJP in front of party president Amit Shah, Lovely said, ""I am pained and angry at the way I have been treated by the party (Congress) in which I worked for 31 years. I could not tolerate more humiliation.""
  

  

  Referring to the displeasure expressed by another former Congress minister, AK Walia, over ticket distribution, Lovely said, ""If senior functionaries like A K Walia can be sidelined, it is pointless to be here. I felt unwanted and unheard as I struggled to meet Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi."" He addded that he wanted to convey his concerns regarding the way Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee was being run.
  

  

  On his choice of BJP, the former Gandhinagar MLA said, ""Both PM Narendra Modi and Shah work tirelessly day and night to deliver honest governance. I want to work for a party like this. I have come here at a time when there is no election, so I am not here for power.""

  Amit Malik, who was the president of Delhi Youth Congress, and around 200 workers also joined BJP along with Lovely. Another senior leader, three-time Kondli MLA Amrish Gautam, has recently joined BJP.

  Maken believes Congress will have an edge, irrespective of the recent infighting in its ranks, and AAP would cease to be a factor. ""Congress will be the dark horse. Mark my words, people will vote for solutions. They are fed up with the everyday bickering between the Delhi and central governments. People know that Congress has the capacity to give solutions and work on them,"" Maken told TOI in an interview.
  

  

  The DPCC chief is upbeat about getting votes. ""We have brought together the best brains in Congress to come out and give global solutions to local problems of municipal governance. So, when we go to the people we tell them to vote for Congress as that's like voting for a set of solutions,"" he said.

  So, what are these solutions? ""If we plug the leakages in the municipal revenue system, then the civic bodies don't need any financial assistance from the state or Centre to survive. For instance, municipal corporations have huge land banks that are currently encroached upon. These can be turned into critical income generating resources. Streamlining of primary healthcare and education is required to ensure maximum benefit for the poor. We will streamline finances to ensure there are no strikes for want of wages. We will clear pending arrears of Rs 1,563 crore due to sanitation workers,"" Maken said.
  

  

  The hike in its vote share, Congress feels, reflects its traditional voters—the poor and minorities—returning to its fold after abandoning it earlier for AAP. ""The poor people don't see AAP as a factor because of non-delivery of promises and over exaggeration of achievements. These two things have hurt the poor the most,"" he said.
  

  

  Maken also said the recent protests by A K Walia and Mangat Ram Singhal over ticket distribution would have no impact on Congress's performance. ""In- house factionalism and groupism is not new in Congress; it has always been there since Congress was created,"" Maken said.
  

  

  Without commenting on the Congress old guard in Delhi, Maken said he was ""trying to create a Congress with a new thinking"", and that he had been given a free hand by the party brass to work on the new strategies he has chalked out for the party.

  The move comes after Delhi government's Health Department approached the State Election Commissioner urging him to declare all the polling stations as 'tobacco free zones' rather than just declaring them as 'smoke-free' as it used to be in earlier elections.
  

  

  In a letter to Commissioner S K Srivastava, Additional Director (Health) Dr S K Arora noted that since chew-able tobacco, a leading cause of oral cancer, is already banned in Delhi, the polling booths should be declared 'tobacco free'.
  

  

  The decision should be taken in larger public health interest, he stressed.
  

  

  The Commission has now sought cooperation of the Commissioners of all three civic bodies — South, North and East municipal corporation — to create 'tobacco free' poll booths for the MCD polls and display multi-colour banners at each location indicating the same.
  

  

  ""It is an excellent opportunity to sensitise nearly 1.33 crore adults on a single day as they will come to cast their vote at the polling booths,"" Dr Arora said.
  

  

  He said 90 per cent of oral cancers, 40 per cent of all cancers and 30 per cent of tuberculosis cases occur because of tobacco habits.
  

  

  Also, 20 per cent cases of diabetes, hypertension, heart attack and brain stroke are also linked to tobacco consumption, he added.
  

  

  The Health department will also provide signages/banners to be displayed at the entry gate of each polling booth.

  The banners will have content to educate people about the ill effects of tobacco consumption including smoking.
  

  

  The objective is also to make public aware that polling booths being a public place, the use and sale of all kinds of tobacco is prohibited, he said.
  

  

  Besides, teams of health departments will also supervise and monitor to ensure that there are no violations of the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) 2003.
  

  

  In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the Election Commission had asked the state election authorities to implement the no- smoke policy in accordance with the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003.","delhi-mcd"

  Responding to charges levelled by Lovely at a press conference on the Congress leadership earlier in the day, Maken told TOI, ""I will only say one thing, we will win in east Delhi."" Lovely had been an MLA from east Delhi's Gandhinagar and was known to have bolstered the party's performance in East Delhi parliamentary constituency that was represented by former chief minister Sheila Dikshit's son, Sandeep, for two terms.
  

  

  Congress sources said Maken's confidence stemmed from the fact that east Delhi still boasted of Congressmen who wielded much clout among voters. It is learnt that Maken is of the view that in the municipal polls, local factors would hold sway and Lovely's move won't impact the poll result. Senior leaders in the party admitted that if it were the assembly or parliamentary elections, the adverse impact would have been more acute.
  

  

  For Congress, the wards under East Delhi Municipal Corporation will now be a critical battlefield. However, Lovely's statements since joining BJP have made it clear that he won't sit idle in this last leg of campaigning. With just two days left for campaigning, Lovely may be seen at BJP's public meetings in different parts of the city. On Wednesday evening, there were already talks of organising a public meeting for Lovely in east Delhi.

They are after all home to popular commercial nerve centres like Ajmal Khan Road for general shopping, Ghaffar Market for electronics and Paharganj for its conglomerate of affordable hotels. The reality for residents is that all these contribute to the area's almost insurmountable problem: congestion.
  

  

  For the voters in the three North Delhi Municipal Corporation wards of Paharganj, Karol Bagh and Dev Nagar, almost all issues that require attention are related to congestion arising from vehicular presence, illegal parking, encroachments and proliferation of street vendors. Residents admit there are problems with sanitation and stray dogs, but these appear tame in the context of congestion. ""It is almost impossible even to drive our children to school,"" said Shobha at Multani Dhanda in Paharganj.
  

  

  Motia Khan businessman Sadanand Vaish blames no one in particular for the mess. ""Residents and shopkeepers indulge in encroachment, even as the local populace is increasingly turning homes into hotels and shops. These are choking the area to death."" Vaish's woes are supplemented by the corporation's decade-long failure to complete the Rani Jhansi Road flyover and Shastri Park multilevel parking, both of which could have eased the vehicle load from the area.

  ""Yes, we agree that tenders for the Shastri Park multilevel parking project have been floated multiple times, but contractors refuse to participate because of the poor financial status of the north corporation,"" conceded Yogender Chandolia, former mayor and councillor from Dev Nagar. ""Even the public-private participation mode didn't interest anyone.""
  

  

  There is a large SC population in the area — Dev Nagar, for instance, has more than 44,000 SCs among its 64,000 residents — and Chandolia blames Delhi government for depriving many of the benefits of its many SC welfare schemes, especially women and widows. But there is no escaping that the corporation itself hasn't done much to deal with the pressing problems. Chandolia identified water and congestion as the wards' twin bugbears. ""Water doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the corporation,"" he argued, ""and a councillor alone cannot do anything about congestion. Pedestrianisation, like the one being experimented with in Connaught Place, cannot be replicated here because the localities are mixed market-residential areas.""
  

  

  Kamlesh Rana recalled how Dev Nagar was a peaceful locality 40 years ago, but had now become unsuitable for residential life due to a preponderance of commercial buildings and heavy vehicles. In Paharganj, Anita Devi shuddered, ""The public toilets are all overflowing and the stink is unbearable."" Unforgivable perhaps for a place that attracts lodgers and shoppers in hordes.
  

  

  Madhu Khurana, Congress candidate from Paharganj and sitting member, deflected the blame to the BJP-led civic body. ""Nothing has been done in the last five years,"" she alleged. ""The Rani Jhansi Road flyover was started 15 years ago when I was a member of MCD, but has not been finished even now."" Her party, she claimed, would come up with a comprehensive plan to make free the wards of congestion.","delhi-mcd"
"167","AAP government sitting on plan to revive Yamuna, says Uma Bharti","NEW DELHI: Union water resources minister Uma Bharti accused Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government of delaying the ""good plan"" that the centre had on reviving the Yamuna. Addressing a BJP campaign meeting at Chandni Chowk on Wednesday, Bharti also took on AAP for questioning the credibility of voting machines.
  

  

  ""We prepared a good plan for the Yamuna river's revival with the help of experts from the University of Virginia. We gave it to the Delhi government to evaluate,"" Bharti said. ""But they are sitting on it. DJB officials don't have the expertise to assess the project.""
  

  

  However, the slow pace of work related to water resources development, Bharti said, had taught her to be patient, and she quipped, ""I am known as a firebrand leader, but working in this ministry has turned me into a water-brand leader.""

  The minister took a dig at Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for his allegation about the tampering of voting machines. ""The election commission has given an open challenge, so why doesn't he go and prove his charge?"" she said. It is not the EVMs that are tampered, she continued, it is the people who have had a change of heart.

  Praising PM Narendra Modi for ""instilling confidence in the people of India"" and starting schemes like Jan Dhan that benefited a lot of people, Bharti criticised Congress for leaving the country in a mess with its ""poor policy decisions"".

  The party has instructed its MLAs to campaign in every ward. Kejriwal himself has been holding two public meetings every day — in Patel Nagar and Moti Nagar on Sunday. The hoardings and posters, which carry the picture of Kejriwal from the time when AAP was given the 'broom' symbol, were seen in Punjabi Bagh, Kalindi Kunj, Mayur Vihar, Akshardham flyover, along the NH-24 and many other places.
  

  

  AAP's Delhi convener Dilip Kumar Pandey said, ""Garbage is all over the roads and dhalaos are overflowing. One of the main responsibilities of the corporations is to keep Delhi clean...but BJP did not do its duty and has turned the city into a garbage bin.""
  

  

  AAP's chief poll plank is cleanliness. Party members have been going around the city telling people that they will deliver and transform the sanitation system if voted to power, just like they delivered on their promises of free water and electricity at half rate. They claimed that the results of the Rajouri Garden poll will not reflect on the party's performance in the civic polls, adding that the people of Delhi are disappointed with BJP. They also said that the Rajouri Garden voters were upset with them because MLA Jarnail Singh had quit to contest the assembly election in Punjab.

  Under the leadership of Rahul and Maken, she alleged on Thursday, the party has only used the issue of empowerment of women and their security to gather votes but it means nothing to them. ""Maken, Rahul Gandhi's nominee in the party, misbehaved, not only with me but also with several other office-bearers of Delhi Mahila Congress. The same was brought to the notice of Rahul Gandhi, but our plea fell on deaf ears.""
  

  

  Terming the party hypocrite, she said while the party expected women Congress workers to protest against BJP's Vinay Katiyar for making absurd remarks about Priyanka Gandhi, ""we were told by Alankar Sawai in his office that we should take up the matter (of misbehaviour) with Maken himself"".
  

  

  Congress is suffering under the ineffective leadership of Rahul, who is ""mentally unfit"" to run the party, said Singh. ""Why is he hiding? Why is he scared of meeting his own party members? Several senior leaders have quit the party because of his reluctance to address issues within the organisation. He is only interested in meeting sycophants."" It is because of this attitude of both Rahul and Maken that ""five district and 75 block presidents have resigned"", she claimed.
  

  

  However, she made it clear that she would remain a ""loyal soldier"" of Congress. ""But in the current organisation where I myself feel unsafe, how will I empower women in it? That's why I am resigning from the post,"" she said.","delhi-mcd"

On the basis of information sought through RTI from the AAP-led Delhi government, the BJP leader claimed that it had failed to keep 14 major promises — Jan Lokpal, WiFi, CCTV in buses and public places, corruption among others — made during the 2015 assembly elections.
  

  

  The Kejriwal government has accepted its total failure, Gupta said, in implementing the 70-point action plan. ""Directorate of Vigilance took general measures to reduce corruption. Jan Lokpal Bill had procedural lapses which were not corrected."" No unauthorised colony has been regularised since January 1, 2015, though lakhs were wooed with that carrot during the elections, said Gupta.
  Earton WomenGirl Tan Sports Running ShoesShopcluesWondering if you need term insurance?MAX LIFE INSURANCERecommended By Colombia

  

  The government has done nothing for higher education as well and only Rs 1.5 crore out of the annual Rs 10-crore funds has been spent in the past two years, he claimed. ""Even the sites for new colleges have not been decided. Neither any fund has been earmarked nor any administrative sanction has been given."" It has also failed to regularise 17,000 guest teachers and fill up 13,000 posts in its schools, he claimed.
  

  

  Only seven CCTV cameras for Rs 29,000 have been installed in Delhi against the estimated requirement of 1 lakh cameras in public places. ""Not a single camera has been installed in any housing society, college or market,"" Gupta said, adding that 100 out of 4,200 buses have got CCTVs. The government has also admitted that it is still in the process of taking approvals to set up WiFi facilities.
  

  

  On health front, only two primary health centres have been opened against the promised 900. Although AAP showcases mohalla clinics as a ""success"" story, Gupta said, ""There is no action plan for providing health cards.""
  

  

  AAP's Delhi convener, Dilip Pandey, termed Gupta's allegations as an extension of mudslinging ahead of the elections.

"175","If EVMs aren’t tampered with, AAP will get over 200 seats in civic polls, says Kejriwal","Faced with a determined BJP and a resurgent Congress, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tells TOI that only AAP can rid the corporations of corruption, raises questions over use of EVMs and impartiality of election commissioners and accuses LG Anil Baijal of unfair leaks.
  

  

  Q: The use of EVMs has become a big issue and you have even sought postponement of the civic polls so that VVPAT could be used. Do you seriously think the corporation elections will be rigged?
  

  

  A: There are just three or four countries in the world that use EVMs for national level elections. The rest of the world uses ballot papers. Germany used EVMs and then moved back to ballot papers. US switched to EVMs for two years and then went back to ballot papers. The experience of most of the world has been that the hardware and software can be easily tampered with. So, it is wrong to say that the EVMs are tamper-proof. They ask how is it possible to influence such a huge administrative machinery involved in the election process. Two companies make EVMs. They are ECIL and BEL. These two in turn import chips from two companies - Renesas, which is Japanese, and Microchips Technologies which is based in US. They say the code is put in the chips by BEL. They put the software in the chip, seal it and send it. They claim that neither can it be seen, nor read. We asked that when the chip comes here, do you check what software has been put by the companies. To this, in an RTI reply to different people, ECI has said that this software cannot be checked as it is masked. All that is needed is to introduce a small bug in these machines...
  

  

  Q: Why are you raising doubts over EVMs now?
  

  

  A: In the past four months, many developments have put a question mark over the reliability of EVMs. In Pune, an independent candidate got zero votes and he wondered where did his own vote and those of his family go. An investigation is needed. In Bhind it happened before so many journalists. There, whichever button was being pressed, the machine was voting for BJP. That is not malfunctioning, that is programming the machine in a manner that it will vote only for BJP. Something did happen to that machine. Was the motherboard changed? Was the chip changed? What happened? Two days later, ECI said the machine was fine. How? Next, questions were raised on 18 EVMs in Dhaulpur where on pressing the button, the vote was going to BJP. This means that the software of many machines has already been changed.
  

  

  Q: Do you still stand by your accusation that EC is acting like Dhritarashtra who wants Duryodhana or BJP to win?
  

  

  A: The reason for saying that is the fact that it is EC's responsibility to instill confidence in the minds of the people of this country about the election process being fair. So, whenever a question is raised on EVMs, EC should get an investigation done and put the findings in public domain. What they are doing instead is saying that they have found the machines to be fine.
  

  

  Q: You are questioning the impartiality of ECI. In this backdrop, what do you think is going to be the outcome in the office-of-profit case? Are you apprehensive that the EC will rule against AAP?
  

  

  A: There is a big question mark over EC. One of the election commissioners, A K Joti, was chief secretary of Gujarat under Modiji. After retirement, he was made chairman of Kandla Port Trust. So, he has worked with the Prime Minister for many years. The second election commissioner has come from Madhya Pradesh and has been very close to Shivraj Singh Chauhan. So, independence of both these election commissioners is under question. The only independent person is Syed Nasim Ahmad Zaidi, who is retiring in two months.
  

  

  Q: Now that you are sending all files for approval to the LG, has decision-making become easy or are there projects still on hold?
  

  

  A: All files are being sent to LG and everything is on hold. There are a lot of things that are not moving. For instance, there was a project for making 10 elevated corridors. That file is pending with the LG's office for one year. Similarly, we had said that we would redesign 10 roads on a pilot basis to end bottlenecks. The file for the architect's appointment is pending with the LG's office. Everything is going there and getting stuck. I now meet the LG regularly, every Wednesday, and seek approval for these files. He says he is studying it, looking at it
  

  

  Q: Your interaction with LG Anil Baijal has been very different from your dealings with Najeeb Jung. You have not publicly taken him on.
  

  

  A: We have no personal enmity with anyone. With this LG, the first three months were very well and we were able to explain our point of view over two-three meetings. But, just before these elections, the way the LG's office started attacking us was not healthy. The files relating to Rs 97 crore spent on advertisements and Ram Jethmalani's fee were leaked to the media. The issue of a Rs 15,000 thali was also leaked though nothing had been paid. So, it appears that the LG's office is an active party in this election. We are not countering all this aggressively because we don't want to make any enemies. To be able to work for people, we are prepared to bend as much as we need to. If we fight, it will be only for the rights and welfare of people.
  

  

  Q: You have promised to do away with house tax on residential properties if your party wins. Aren't you resorting to the politics of subsidies?
  

  

  A: The money belongs to people and all I am doing is returning your money to you. Should you be happy or angry? I repeat that there is no dearth of money in government, it is all about intention. I can streamline the house tax system but if my assessment shows that it is not required, then why not do away with it for residential properties? We reduced VAT from 12% to 5%. South Delhi Municipal Corporation's total budget is Rs 3300 crore; the house tax component is only Rs 300 crore. This is not very significant but people face a lot of harassment in paying the tax. There is so much corruption in MCD. A CAG report shows that Rs 1960 crore worth of pension was given to dead people over 10 years. The corporations also have 40,000 ghost employees on their payrolls. There are illegal hoardings, illegal parking. If all this is taken care of, so much money will be saved. We are saying that we will clean Delhi and make the city shine in one year. Cleaning Delhi is not rocket science. You need to float an international global tender. There are so many companies that work on sanitation in European countries. They can be hired to get your city cleaned. The corporations waste so much money on lifting and disposing of garbage.
  

  

  Q: You are talking of corruption in MCD but your campaign has not adequately focused on all that BJP has not done?
  

  

  A: When the MCD campaign started, these people started leaking files to the media on a daily basis through the LG's office and shifted the entire focus on us. Because of this, MCD could not be discussed much. Now our focus is only on one thing -- that if you want to clean Delhi, if you want to remove garbage and mosquitoes from Delhi, only AAP can do it. We are saying that in Delhi government, we practically have four major departments -- water, power, education and health. In all these sectors, we have delivered and now we are saying we will make a difference in sanitation.
  

  
    

    Q: The recent CVC report must have given you a lot of satisfaction. Considering the fact that ACB was not in your control, how was this achieved?
  
  

  

  A: Corruption has gone down as a result of technology and computerization. In departments like transport, human interaction has been reduced in a big way by doing away with manual processes. At the SDM office earlier, people would take a token and wait as the processes were manual, but now everything is online. One, technology is very important for reducing human interaction for dealing with corruption. Second is deterrence which is where Anti-Corruption Branch has a big role, but that was taken away from our government. Technology also brings transparency. The maximum effect of all this is visible in the departments of transport, revenue and health. For instance, EWS admissions and all processes in mohalla clinics and polyclinics have been made online. Theft of medicines is almost impossible now.
  

  

  Q: You are no longer attacking Narendra Modi.
  

  

  A: We have always done issue-based politics. We supported Swachh Bharat Mission and the yoga initiative but opposed demonetization because we think that was wrong.
  

  

  Q: Congress appears to be stronger than in 2015. Does that worry you?
  

  

  A: We are not worried. Our surveys show Congress is a distant third.
  

  

  Q: What about the AAP debacle in Rajouri Garden. Booth-wise results there show a shift in voters from AAP?
  

  

  A: There was a lot of anger among people over our decision to move out Jarnail Singh to fight the polls in Punjab. We sensed the anger a fortnight before the poll. Our door-to-door survey teams gave us the feedback.
  

  

  Q: Jarnail Singh has said that deep and honest introspection is required. He was referring to choice of candidates?
  

  

  A: Whenever a candidate is given a ticket, four people are denied. We are very clear that we will not compromise on four Cs -- communalism, corruption, crime and character. If anyone has any complaint on these grounds, they can come and object but things like this one was better and that one could have won are points of analysis. The party's PAC does that assessment.

  Q: Will these polls be a referendum on your government?
  

  

  A: We say compare the two years of Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi and 10 years of BJP in the municipal corporations. We want to ask if BJP has done one good thing in 10 years that people remember. Woh badmaash hain, woh nikkame hain, woh bhrashtachari hain, so don't vote for them. See our performance in Delhi for over two years and vote for us. I feel that if the polls are fair and EVMs are not tampered with, then AAP will get more than 200 seats. I would appeal to people to come and vote in large numbers so that the eight to nine per cent shift they may try to do through EVMs will get compensated by way of high voting.
  

  

  Q: Is there some restlessness among senior functionaries of your party? Do you feel a sense of crisis?
  

  

  A: There is nothing like that. I feel overall the crisis before the country is more serious. This game over EVMs that they have started. If this is way they will win elections, there will be no meaning left in the electoral process and democracy. The other big concern is the way violence is happening in society...not just physical violence....the atmosphere of fear that is taking shape is dangerous. If you write or speak anything contrary to the views of the government, then first you will be attacked with abusive language on social media, on phone or through sms. Then fake cases will be slapped, income tax will be unleashed on you...this atmosphere of fear is very dangerous.","delhi-mcd"
"177","Delhi: Strike call by union of app-based cabbies fails","NEW DELHI: The call for strike on Tuesday by a union of Ola and Uber drivers failed to disrupt app-based cab services in Delhi NCR, as commuters could book taxis with ease through the day. Unlike the February strike, which had hit commuters hard for 13 days, most of Ola and Uber drivers chose not to participate in Tuesday's strike called by the Sarvodaya Drivers' Association of Delhi. The union claims to represent 1.25 lakh app-based taxis.
  

  

  During the evening and morning peak hours, cabs were easily available on both Ola and Uber apps. However, the companies resorted to surge pricing on some routes. The drivers' union has given a 10-day ultimatum to the Delhi government to act on their demands, failing which they will go on an indefinite strike. ""This time, it will have a major impact on the operation of app-based taxis,"" said Ravi Rathore, vice-president of the union.
  

  

  Although the strike had no impact, Rathore claimed around 50% of the cabs went off roads in NCR. ""Around 50% of app-based cabs did not ply in Delhi NCR. We held a protest outside the CM's office,"" he added. The drivers have been demanding an increase in fares from the existing Rs 6 per km to Rs 20 per km. They are also demanding abolition of 25% commission that the drivers are charged by cab aggregators. The drivers also want the government to allow them to ply their taxis on the fares prescribed by the Delhi transport department.

  Maken said Congress would keep a fund of Rs 2,000 crore separately for development of unauthorised colonies, resettlement colonies and slum clusters. A separate department would be formed for poverty alleviation, which would deal with the overall development of safai karamcharis, domestic workers, construction workers, autorickshaw drivers, rickshaw-pullers and other labourers, he said.
  

  

  ""Within six months we will regularise all the contractual employees and make the three corporations self-reliant by increasing collection from property tax, toll tax, parking and outdoor advertising departments.

He also blamed the leadership, especially at the state level, for the ""mess"" in the party.
  

  

  Lovely was reacting to some Congress functionaries calling him an ""opportunist"" — Dikshit had on Tuesday said that the former DPCC chief had betrayed the party.
  

  

  Explaining his decision to join BJP, Lovely said he had two options: either become a burden like Dikshit, or be called a ""traitor"" by joining a party that is fighting for the cause of soldiers. ""I would rather be called a traitor by joining BJP than be a burden on Congress like Sheila Dikshit,"" he said. ""I respect Sheilaji, but I'm calling her a burden as she has no say in the party. She was not consulted during ticket distribution. She is neither a part of the manifesto and campaign committees nor is she being called to campaign. Why is she in Congress then?"" he said.
  

  

  He said Congress' reluctance to pitch a Sikh chief ministerial face even in a state like Punjab had disappointed the community.
  

  

  ""For the Sikh community in the city and the country, there can't be a better platform than BJP. I appeal to the community, especially in Delhi, to vote for BJP,"" said Lovely.
  

  

  Following in Lovely's footsteps, several of his supporters joined BJP on Wednesday. These included senior functionaries such as Sukhbir Sharma, Vinod Jain (a Congress rebel who is contesting as an independent from Shastri Park), S K Puri, Parminder Singh, Pankaj Kochar, Rahul Mathur and Sandeep Singh.

"182","MCD polls: Up close and personal with ‘netas’","NEW DELHI: Civic polls are fast approaching and amid the cacophony of allegations and tall promises, Delhiites might be finding it hard to choose from a plethora of candidates wanting to represent their ward. Residents of south Delhi's East of Kailash, though, got a better opportunity to know their candidates and their views on a host of issues.
  

  

  On Sunday evening, in a 'meet your candidate' programme, organised by United Residents Joint Action of Delhi (URJA), three candidates — Indu Sharma (Congress), Devender Tanwar (AAP) and Rajpal (BJP) participated in a debate.
  Benefits from home refinancing.TomorrowMakersInvest here today to become rich tomorrowFundsIndiaRecommended By Colombia

  

  A set of questions was given to the candidates in five rounds, revolving around five issues — local problems; views on constitution of residents ward committee; their perspective and promises in the manifesto; the pollution crisis; and corruption in the civic apparatus. Each candidate was given two minutes. There was strict enforcement of rules and the microphone had to be muted many times, eliciting a protest from supporters.
  

  

  While the AAP candidate focused on sanitation and non-functioning streetlights, Sharma from Congress spoke about lack of parking space as the main issue. BJP candidate Rajpal said the real problem was lack of intent, leading to a situation in which spots like Okhla mandi have become a nightmare. While all three candidates supported creation of a resident ward committee through which citizens can monitor projects happening in the city, the AAP candidate reminded people that the Mohalla Sabha Bill, which would have created 40 mohalla sabhas in Kalkaji, was a better solution and was shot down by the LG.
  

  

  A common feature in western democracies, such town hall debates and meetings have failed here because of rowdy supporters and lack of cooperation from candidates. However, the gathering of 200-250 residents in Ramesh Gupta Park proved that such events can be carried out successfully.
  

  

  Retired wing commander and URJA convener, J S Chaddha, said, ""It is very important for voters to be informed about their candidates. We had apprehensions that candidates might back out or things might go haywire but in the end, we were able to organise it successfully with the help of people. URJA has a presence in many wards and we will try to organise more such debates"". Chaddha was also the moderator for the debate.","delhi-mcd"

  The revised pension will be taken up by the Union cabinet along with three-four issues related to the pay of central government employees, even as a committee headed by Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa finalises its recommendations for allowances for government employees, including an increase in the house rent allowance (HRA). The panel is expected to submit its recommendations next week but there are indications that the change in allowances may not take place immediately.
  

  

  ""The revised pension scheme has been finalised and the government has postponed a decision due to the code of conduct for Delhi municipal elections. The cabinet may clear it next week,"" said a source, who did not wish to be identified.
  

  

  The pay panel had recommended an increment-linked pension formula along with the option for multiplying the pension based on the six pay commission's recommendations by 2.57. To quickly implement the suggestions, the government opted for the second option as the increment-linked pension model was seen to be difficult to implement. This has created a situation where those who retired by December 31, 2015 are receiving a lower pension compared to someone who retired a month later. For instance, someone who retired as a secretary before January 2016 is getting a pension of Rs 1.02 lakh compared to Rs 1.12 lakh for someone who retired at the end of the month.
  

  

  Now, the government is looking at two options -- one is to move to a new ""modified parity-plus"" formula, which links the pension to the salary drawn by someone who is at the same rank. The other is a formula based on the multiple of the sixth pay commission-based pension. A sources said the factor of 2.57 is also being changed to make the pension more attractive. ""Basically, there will be two options for a pensioner and the formula that ensures a higher payout to the seniors will be given,"" explained a source.","delhi-mcd"

""For 10 years BJP ruled the civic bodies, but it has not kept its promise. They are using middlemen who extort money from the people in the name of house tax,"" alleged Dilip Kumar Pandey, AAP Delhi convener.

  AAP functionary Harish Awasthi said: ""Out of a total of 50 lakh registered properties, currently civic bodies legally get house tax from only 11 lakh properties.""
  

  

  BJP, however, rejected the allegations. ""BJP never announced that it will waive house tax for all Delhi households,"" said Rajesh Bhatia, general secretary Delhi BJP. ""In 2007 BJP promised to waive the tax in urban villages and rural areas but not across the capital.""
  

  

  AAP also promised that when it comes to power, it will constitute town vending committees, and regularise street vendors soon.
  

  

  ""BJP has looted Rs 1.31 crores from vendors. Each street vendor gave Rs 100 as fees for regularisation and license while some of them were charged Rs 500 and Rs 1000 by middlemen who enjoyed the political patronage of BJP and Congress,"" alleged Pandey.

"185","Young guns turn up heat on politicians twice their age","NEW DELHI: The generation gap will be bridged on April 23, when youngsters take on contestants as old as their parents for a seat in the municipal corporations.
  

  

  For instance, in Timarpur, 21-year-old Megha, who prefers to go by her first name, shrugs off the dismissals of her more seasoned opponents, one of whom mocked, ""Megha is younger than my son, she needs time to mature."" She counters this with the aggression and optimism of youth.
  

  

  The final year undergraduate student of Delhi University and Swaraj India candidate smiled, ""Most of my rivals are older than my father, yes, but I have the support of slum dwellers whose children I have been teaching for over a year.""
  

  

  Whether new ideas and age are enough to beat experience will be clear only on April 26, the day the ballots are counted.
  

  

  But the outcome of their campaigns is not crucially important to this clutch of newly minted politicians in just the second decade of their lives.
  

  

  To them, the public embrace of their aims is more important than deference to the age and experience of their opponents. As BJP candidate from Raghubir Nagar, 22-year old Poorva Sankla, put it: ""Age is not a factor, the willingness to work for the people is.""
  

  

  Ideals fuel the enthusiasm of youthful politicians. If Megha's intention, being a jhuggi dweller herself, is to elevate jhuggi-jhopris to the top of the corporations' priority list, Leena Asiwal, 21, AAP candidate from Vikaspuri, hopes to root out corruption, which she described as ""the biggest obstacle in improving the infrastructure and sanitation in the ward"".
  

  

  Independent candidate from Rani Bagh, Jyoti, is similarly motivated. Once a child labourer who was aided by an NGO in overcoming the objections of her family to get herself educated, Jyoti explained, ""I thought I could change more lives if I joined politics. That is why I am fighting the civic polls.""

  Kajal Sharma became active in social service after being inspired by Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement. She is taking on the much older and more experienced Nilam Arora, the Congress candidate, Vandana Jaitely of BJP and Simmi Gupta of AAP as a Swaraj India nominee in Rani Bagh.
  

  

  ""I often went to the local councillor for help in cleaning up areas in the ward, but he did not help. So I decided to defeat him in an election,"" confided the commerce graduate from Delhi University.
  

  

  It was a feeling of helplessness that also drove 21-year-old Kajal Sherawat to politics. ""The councillors never bother about people's problems too much after winning elections. The ward needs young blood like me,"" declared Sherawat, most of whose rivals are aged above 50.
  

  

  Many hope it is not mere words that these youngsters are indulging in. But they have the example of Sankla, an engineer who left her Rs 9 lakh per annum job because she felt she could do a better job in improving educational facilities and sanitation in her ward. Voters expect that like her, the others too will put their money where their mouth is.","delhi-mcd"
"186","How municipal schools are failing Delhi’s children","NEW DELHI: The three municipal corporations of Delhi have the responsibility of educating nearly 8.2 lakh children in the primary section, from Class I to V. Given the ever increasing fees in private schools, the municipal schools have a crucial significance. But a report, based on data collected by Praja Foundation through RTI applications, found the enrollment has dropped 27% in the past five years, the dropout rate is at a high 12%, and the pupil-teacher ratio is much higher than the prescribed 1 teacher per 40 students. Supportive programmes like mid-day meals are deficient, school libraries are poor, sports facilities are lacking and a majority of students need to supplement school lessons with private tuition.
  Footlodge Mens Blue  Black Lace-up Smart Casuals ShoesShopcluesDo you have enough for the future? Check now!TomorrowMakersRecommended By Colombia

  

  The report released in December 2016 said the East Delhi Municipal Corporation appeared to be the worst affected, with dropout rates touching 18%, he pupil teacher ratio at 42:1, utilisation of allocated funds under various heads very low, and nil expenditure on mid-day meals and libraries in 2015-16. EDMC had the lowest per student spend among all three corporations.
  

  

  The south corporation recorded the lowest dropout figures and a better pupil-teacher ratio, but its utilization of Plan allocations was just 67%, even if its spending under non-Plan heads was much higher.
  

  

  Clearly, a combination of factors — finances, utilization planning (or academic expertise) and political leadership —play a role in this dismal trend. One worrying fallout of this drop in municipal education quality is that families are opting out of the affordable municipal schools and entering the costlier private-education system. Many families are likely to pull out their children at some stage of schooling, and perhaps the axe will fall on the girl child.
  

  

  Electioneering for the municipal corporations has come to a close. Now the fate of schoolchildren is in the hands of an electorate that has been given wild promises on education by the three main political contenders.","delhi-mcd"

  ""Senior Congress leaders are joining BJP. I came to know that Ajay Maken spoke to Amit Shah recently and he may also join the BJP after the civic polls,"" the AAP leader said.

"190","Our corporators failed to tell people about our work: Tiwari","You started campaigning very early with your night stays at slums. What insight into the mind of the Delhi electorate did you got through this long spell of campaigning?
  

  

  People aren't clear about the roles and duties of various civic and government agencies in the city. More than sanitation, water and waterlogging are the main issues in this municipal election. In east Delhi, water supply is a serious problem. People get aggressive as they are not getting water supply in their homes though they are ready to pay. I can't explain to people that it doesn't come under the corporations.
  

  

  Similarly, traffic is another big problem, especially in east Delhi. It is PWD's responsibility to construct flyovers and widen roads for smooth traffic movement. Waterlogging is another problem, but people don't know that only cleaning of only small drains is with the corporations. PWD is responsible for the big drains.
  

  

  Why is there a compulsion to bring PM Narendra Modi so much into the campaign?
  

  

  Narendra Modi is the name of a policy. When we take Modi's name, people know that we are talking about development, public welfare, action against corrupt people etc. Congress has a policy called Rahul Gandhi which stands for corruption, inefficiency etc.
  

  

  BJP's manifesto for the upcoming elections is largely a repeat of party's poll promises made during 2007 and 2012 municipal polls.
  

  

  The corporations couldn't deliver due to shortage of funds. Out of the Delhi government's Rs 48,000-crore budget, the three civic agencies are supposed to get Rs 9000 crore. But the government is not giving funds.
  

  

  While you criticized AAP for promising property tax waiver, BJP has also assured that no new taxes will be levied for the next five years. How do you plan to boost internal revenue?
  

  

  Who itna jhoot bol chuke hai ki ab unhe log yeh kehne lage hai ki Modiji ke pass 56-inch ka seena hai aur Arvind Kejriwal ke pass 56-inch ki jeebh hai. (He has lied so much that people have started saying that Modiji's chest size is 56 inch and Arvind Kejriwal's tongue is 56 inch long).
  

  

  For the next five years, we will not introduce any new taxes. We will try to provide services from the funds we will get from the state government. We will also try to fix the problem areas which have become a source of corruption. We can increase our internal revenue without increasing or imposing new taxes.
  

  

  You said that efforts will be made to ensure corporations get funds directly from the Centre. How will it be done?
  

  

  There will be a (financial) problem for a year...The budget for this financial year has been cleared (by the Centre). But this year, our focus will be on ensuring that the Delhi government releases corporations' share in funds on time....The present government is discriminating against the corporations because of its political agenda. We will protest against this.
  

  

  BJP couldn't utilize the funds given by the Centre under Swachh Bharat mission, PM's pet project. In 10 years, BJP couldn't streamline the solid waste management in the city.
  

  

  If the corporations had done their duty in implementing that mission, then we wouldn't have had to change 153 councillors.
  

  

  Do you expect some of the sitting corporators who have been victims of a mass culling to silently work against the party?

  The party is keeping a close watch on everybody and will not any tolerate anti-party activities. People will be punished. We are not saying that all are corrupt but they were inefficient.
  

  

  They failed to tell people about the work the corporations have done. They allowed the opposition parties to create a perception that the corporations didn't do much work, which is completely wrong. For instance, parks are the most happening places in Delhi.
  

  

  BJP has been attacking Congress for corruption but has now welcomed former Delhi Congress chief Arvinder Singh Lovely, who was a minister in the Sheila Dikshit government. How do you explain this?
  

  

  We have taken only good and honest people. Arvinder's style of working and his image is spotless. He has worked for the development of the city. If he feels that he can do the same work with help from Narendra Modi's policy, then there is nothing wrong in it.","delhi-mcd"

  ""Congress has introduced its candidates as wives and daughters of a particular person. Many leaders have managed to get the party nomination by getting their wives and female relatives to contest the seat,"" Yadav alleged. Swaraj India, Yadav said, has done its best to be gender inclusive by fielding 111 women among the 211 fighting the polls under its banner — 19 in the general wards and 92 in the seats reserved for women.
  

  

  One of the party's star woman candidates is international para-athlete Suvarna Raj in Badarpur.

It isn't without feeling that Raj wants to work for greater inclusivity for disabled students in corporation schools.

  Terming the Rajouri Garden bypoll verdict as a trailer, Naidu predicted a landslide victory for BJP in the civic polls. ""The fact that AAP couldn't even save its deposit despite having 67 MLAs shows the level of resentment among people.""
  

  

  The performance of BJP during its 10 years of MCD rule remained characteristically missing from Naidu's speech. Potshots were taken at both the major opposition parties. Naidu blamed chief minister Kejriwal for becoming ""over ambitious"" and ""running away"" from responsibilities in the capital. ""You gave an overwhelming mandate to Kejriwal, but what happened? He went to Varanasi, Gujarat, Goa and Punjab and lost everywhere. Now he is asking you to vote for him again,"" he said.

Despite all this, we will win,"" said Delhi BJP's media in-charge Praveen Shankar Kapoor.","delhi-mcd"
"199","Wary of Arvind Kejriwal, election commissioner off AAP cases","NEW DELHI: Election Commissioner O P Rawat decided to recuse himself from all EC cases related to AAP as he was wary of an even more vicious attack by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal — who had accused him of bias in a recent interview to TOI — if the EC verdict in the office of profit case against 21 AAP MLAs were to go against them.
  

  

  However, the other Election Commissioner A K Joti, whose impartiality was questioned by Kejriwal in the same interview, has refused to follow in Rawat's footsteps, telling TOI that he would continue to ""discharge his duties in a free, fair and impartial manner and as per law"".
  

  

  With the disqualification plea against 21 AAP MLAs being the most prominent case awaiting the EC verdict on its maintainability in the wake of the HC cancelling their appointment as parliamentary secretaries, the EC is consulting legal experts on whether Rawat, who was part of the hearing before the order was reserved, can recuse himself from the final verdict.
  

  

  When contacted, Rawat confirmed he had written to the CEC saying that in view of CM's interview to TOI questioning his independence as election commissioner, he would like to recuse himself from all AAP-related cases being heard by EC. This, he submitted in the letter, was to ensure that Kejriwal and AAP not only get justice ""but also perceive that EC has been fair beyond any shred of doubt"".
  

  

  ""Since Kejriwal had stated in the interview that he did not have faith in my impartiality, the only option available to me to instil his confidence in EC was to recuse myself from all AAP cases before EC,"" said Rawat.
  

  

  Even as the EC is still examining its impact on the office of profit case against 21 AAP MLAs, Rawat insisted that he had consciously recused himself to ensure that he is spared ""a much sharper attack from Kejriwal and AAP on his impartiality in the event of an adverse decision"".

  EC officials said Rawat's recusing himself was ""an individual decision by an independent election commissioner"". Sources indicated the possibility of the order in AAP case being a two-member bench decision comprising the CEC and EC A K Joti.
  

  

  Meanwhile, Rawat's colleague Joti on Thursday told TOI that while he had no comments to offer on the decision, as far as he was concerned, he was part of all collective decisions by ECs that were not only free, fair and impartial but taken strictly as per the relevant laws and rules.
  

  

  ""The decisions taken by EC are not by one individual. They are decisions of EC as a whole and are mostly unanimous,"" he said.
  

  

  Joti added that EC had been regularly meeting and hearing complaints of office-bearers of all parties including AAP, and examining their suggestions with due diligence before taking appropriate action as per the law. ""Not once have we said no to officer bearers of parties who want to meet. We have also met and heard Kejriwal and other office-bearers of AAP. Our decisions and action are only guided by the law and rules,"" he said.","delhi-mcd"
