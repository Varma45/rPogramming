"5","Amid Dissent, BJP Meets In Karnataka For Mission 150"," HighlightsBefore the meet, KS Eshwarappa went againt state party leaders
All eyes were on state BJP who need to be united for the upcoming polls
Mission 150 targets winning 150 of 224 seats in 2018 Karnataka elections
                                There has been an unusual amount of interest in the state executive meet of the BJP in Karnataka that began today in Mysuru. The two-day meet, attended by state leaders and central representatives, is focussed on Mission 150 - the target of winning 150 out of 224 seats in Karnataka's Assembly elections scheduled for next year.

But the real interest from the media and political watchers was on another, unstated mission - the urgent need for the state BJP to get its act together and be united in the countdown to those polls.

The run-up to the meet had seen defiance of state party president and former chief minister, BS Yeddyurappa by KS Eshwarappa, a Kuruba leader. In December last year, Mr Eshwarappa launched the Sangolli Rayana Brigade, a Dalit and backward class organisation, against the wishes of Mr Yeddyurappa. Late last month, he and his followers held a meeting in Bengaluru - to 'save' the party from what they said was Mr Yeddyurappa's autocratic style of functioning. Mr Yeddyurappa protested.

The BJP high command took notice of the row and four office bearers - two from each side - were removed by state in-charge Muralidhara Rao.

There was speculation whether Mr Eshwarappa would even attend the Mysuru meet. But he did arrive, one of the last leaders to do so. He told NDTV as he entered, ""I do not wish to say anything none,"" in response to our questions on party unity. A meeting of the Sangolli Ratana Brigade, scheduled on Monday in Raichur has been postponed.

There were small problems that had been sorted out, Union Minister Ananth Kumar told NDTV. Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar said that he would only speak about party matters in the party forum - and that the meet was to focus on strategy for the election.

Karnataka was described by the BJP as its Gateway to the South - and Mr Yeddyurappa was its first chief minister in its first government in southern India in 2009. It earlier had an uneasy coalition with the Janata Dal Secular in the state which did not end well - but the party came back to form the government by itself.

Outwardly, the Mysuru meet is progressing peacefully. But the party clearly needs to deal with its unity before taking on the ruling Congress at the polls.","bengaluru:"
"9","In Politically Fragile Goa, Congress Takes Aim At Manohar Parrikar's MLA Election","                             A flurry of political activity in Goa, a state with 40 assembly seats, has triggered fresh reports of political uncertainty.

There are speculations, some even bordering on whether the Congress is attempting a ""coup"" on Manohar Parrikar who will have to contest an election to become a legislator in September to cement his position as the Chief Minister of the state.

After the sacking of the Congress in-charge of Goa, Digvijaya Singh, who was blamed for botching up the Congress's prospect of forming a government in the state, the new in-charge, A Chellakumar, is now trying to give Goa a fresh shot.

Sources say that Mr Chellakumar camped in Goa for five days and was in touch with some legislators to see how the party that has 15 MLAs and is five short of the government formation mark could be back in the saddle.

When asked about these reports of an attempted coup, Mr Chellakumar said ""Goa is a small state where everyone is in touch with everyone."" He also added that ""Goans voted against the BJP in 26 seats so it was a vote against Manohar Parrikar.""

Congress sources say that Mr Parrikar is worried about his prospects of a safe election from Panaji hence the BJP is giving wind to rumours of the Congress trying to orchestrate a coup.

There's also intense speculation that the three MLAs of current BJP-led coalition partner ""Goa Forward"" could abandon the BJP - a party it was ideologically opposed to before the elections. This forced ""Goa Forward's"" Vijay Sardesai to take to Facebook Live and clarify that there were no such plans. Trashing the reports, he told NDTV that he said ""We are getting the respect in the government. Our positions on issues are becoming policies and it is because of the Goa Forward that Manohar Parrikar is chief minister.""

The BJP's Goa General Secretary Sadanand Tanavde told NDTV that ""Manohar Parrikar is a strong leader and will easily win in the elections that are expected to take place in September. The Congress's A Chellakumar is making false claims that the party is in touch with some MLAs because he is struggling to keep his flock together.""

The Congress had won 17 of the state's 40 seats in the recently concluded assembly elections. But as the party bickered over who would be Chief Minister, the BJP, which won four seats less, stitched together a coalition with regional parties and Independent legislators. Because the potential allies wanted Manohar Parrikar - who till then was the Union Defence Minister - to lead the government, he was shifted back to Goa. The miffed Congress had cried foul, saying it should have been given change to form the government.","panaji:"

                                The two-day executive meet of the Karnataka BJP unit, that ends today in Mysuru, saw the party trying hard to present a united front and keep it together. Ahead of the meet, backward class leader KS Eshwarappa continued his open defiance against state party president, BS Yeddyurappa. Also, there was little interaction between the two during the meet that focused on Mission 150 - the target of winning 150 out of 224 seats in Karnataka's Assembly elections scheduled for next year.

Talking to Press Trust of India, All India Congress Committee secretary Girish Chodankar today said, ""We will be fielding a candidate, who will be acceptable to all the parties. When I say that I mean all the non-BJP parties.""

Goa has the lone Rajya Sabha seat, which is currently represented by Congress leader Shantaram Naik. The election to the RS seat would be held on June 8.

Mr Chodankar said, ""Congress will field a consensus candidate, who will be acceptable to all the parties, including the Goa Forward Party, the Maharashrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and other independents, who are part of the Manohar Parrikar-led state government.

The Congress leader said, ""The upcoming RS election will be fought cutting across the party lines with the sole aim to have a non-BJP candidate winning it.""

When contacted, BJP Goa general secretary Sadanand Tanawade said his party was yet to decide the candidate, but it would be a choice of all the parties, which support the Parrikar-led government.

""We will meet tomorrow to finalise the name of the candidate for the RS polls,"" Mr Tanawade said.

""Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar will take a call on this. The candidate that BJP will field will have support of all the coalition partners,"" Mr Tanawade said.

Goa Forward Party's mentor Vijai Sardesai was unavailable for comment, but a senior party functionary said that they were yet to take decision on the RS poll.

""Ideally, we will go with the ruling government as we are part of it,"" he said.","panaji:"

Mr Yeddyurappa was named the party's choice for the Chief Minister's post by BJP chief Amit Shah in August.

Assembly elections in the state are due next year, in which the Congress is trying to stay in power for the second consecutive term.

The Congress today announced some restructuring within the party. The changes come after party vice president Rahul Gandhi's strategy meet with the key state leaders.

State Home Minister G Parameshwara will step down from the cabinet and devote himself to his duties as chief of the party's state unit, the party has said. A statement from party's national general secretary Janardan Dwivedi also announced the elevation of SR Patil, Dinesh Gundurao, minister DK Shivakumar, former Union minister K H Muniyappa and Satish Jarkiholi in various party posts.

The appointments have been made keeping in mind all sections and castes of the state. While Siddaramaiah is a key leader from the Kuruba Gowda community, Mr Parameshwara and Mr Muniyappa are Dalit leaders. The dominant Lingayat and community is represented by Mr Patil, the Vokkaligas by Mr Shivakumar. Mr Jarkiholi has a huge following among tribals.

The BJP, which recently saw a revolt against Mr Yeddyurappa by backward class leader KS Easwarappa, is trying to keep a united front.","bengaluru:"

""As the legislatives approach, this (government) is of course essential, and will determine everything that happens afterwards. But the government is here to govern. It is here to prepare the recovery, it is here to create something, it is here to put projects in place.""The new cabinet will meet for the first time on Thursday.Under the French voting system, if no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round of voting for the National Assembly, the leading candidates go forward to a second round on June 18. The Harris poll gave no forecast of what would happen then or how many seats each party might win.But the poll's findings strengthen the chances that Macron will be able to count on parliamentary backing for his plans, which include corporate tax cuts, labour market reforms, and a 50 billion euro investment plan coupled with public spending savings.The Harris poll for French television found support for the centre-right The Republicans and the far-right National Front both on 19 percent, each down one point from the May 11 poll.Support for the far-left France Unbowed party rose a point to 15 percent while the Socialist Party's backing fell by a point to six percent.The online poll was carried out between May 15 and 17 - after Macron named conservative lawmaker Edouard Philippe as his prime minister and before the new government was unveiled on Wednesday.Six French voters out of 10 hope that Macron will have a majority in parliament, the Harris poll found.Macron's party announced a list of 428 candidates, most of them political unknowns, last Thursday to fight the parliamentary elections.But the party, which currently has no seats in the National Assembly, has yet to pick dozens of other candidates for the 577 seats at stake, hoping more politicians from other parties will switch sides.","paris:"

"28","Stay Humble, Don't Get Complacent: Amit Shah To BJP Workers","                             Stay humble and do not get complacent, BJP national president Amit Shah told party workers on Tuesday, while attributing to them its overwhelming victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

The party workers should not feel relaxed and complacent after the BJP's win in UP. Instead, more efforts should be made to improve party's prospects on the assembly seats and booths where it is weak, Mr Shah said.

He was addressing the state executive meeting of the BJP on concluding day of its two-day meet, which was held for the first time after the saffron party stormed to power in the recent Assembly elections.

Terming the BJP as a ""party of patriots"", Mr Shah said, ""The party workers must not sit back and relax, but make efforts to reachout those booths, where it is weak and tell people about the various welfare schemes initiated by the Centre and state governments, thereby increasing the membership of the party.""

Noting that there were 16,000 workers in the BJP, he said if one party worker decides to strengthen five booths, then the party would automatically reach to 80,000 booths.

""The party workers must go the booth level and work with the dalits, the poor and the labourers, and tell them about the various welfare measures of the Centre and state government,"" he said.

The people should be told how the party came up with the 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra' before the UP assembly elections while working on 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas', Mr Shah said.

Lauding the hard work of party workers, he said, ""It is due to their toil that BJP which started as a 10-member party is now having 11 crore members, and is the largest political party in the world.""

""It is because of the hardwork of the party workers that the party has formed government on its own strength in 14 states, while it shares power with allies in three states,"" he said.

The party has 282 MPs in Lok Sabha and 1,387 MLAs throughout the country, he pointed out.

""But, the party workers should not feel relaxed or complacent and take steps to ensure that BJP makes inroads to each and every part of India,"" he said.

After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, people of UP wanted to get rid of casteism, dynastic politics and appeasement, and they have given a green signal by voting for the BJP, heralding a new era in the state, he said, and added that UP had been suffering from policy paralysis all these years.

""It is for these reasons that the BJP did not name its election yatras as 'Vijay Yatra' but called them 'Parivartan Yatra'. Our main aim was to help UP get free from the 15 years of misrule of SP and BSP. The Yogi government will do 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas', and we are seeing glimpses of this in the first few months,"" he added.","lucknow:"

"31","UP Elections 2017: Not Religion Or Caste, Bareilly Votes For Jobs","                             Ravi Singh Rawat expected to land a white-collar job once he graduated. But the student of economics who spoke fluent English, found jobs were not easy to come by. After three years of futile search, the 24-year-old ended up working in a small motorcycle repair shop in Bareilly's Civil Lines.

""""I was one of the brightest in my class but there are no jobs... I don't like doing this, but I have a family to feed. I had to do something,"" he said, staring at his grease-stained hands and dirty work clothes.

That is the story of many in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly, the state's seventh-largest city which votes on Wednesday. In 2015, when the Akhilesh Yadav government advertised for 368 peons, it received nearly 23 lakh applications. Every tenth was from a graduate or a post-graduate, and more than 200 aspirants were research scholars.

Tackling unemployment among the educated young men and women has been a challenge that successive governments in state capital Lucknow - including the Samajwadi Party government -- have been unable to face up to.

It is a point the leaders of the BJP - which hadn't been in power in the state for more than 20 years -- have rubbed in over the last few weeks of campaign. In Bareilly, the party is competing with the ruling Samajwadi Party and its ally Congress for the same votebank. BJP candidate Arun Kumar had won the seat in 2012 and hopes to repeat his performance -- his party hopes to benefit from the divided votes.

But the ban on high-value currency notes in November to flush out black money - a move the BJP claims has huge support from the people -- appears to have created some difficulties in small towns like Bareilly. It has further shrunk employment opportunities in a state that is now estimated to have over one crore unemployed people in the 15 to 35 year age group.

Many flourishing businesses in Bareilly - once known for its furniture and woven cots - are on the verge of a collapse. ""I haven't been able to source raw-material, can't pay my labourers,"" said Abdul Rafeek, whose family has been making cots for four generations.

A young furniture labour, Amit Sharma too blames demonetisation for the decline in his income. ""We have lost 70% of our business due to the notes ban. There was a time when I didn't have money to buy milk for the house,"" he says.

A daily wager at a transport company, Raje agrees. ""My earnings of Rs 300 have been reduced to Rs 150 all because of demonetisation... There is no work! Where do we go?"" he says. ""This election is neither on religion, nor on caste. We shall vote only for employment,"" he says.","bareilly:"
"33","UP Elections 2017: BJP Bets On Man Who Ended Its Winning Streak In Allahabad","                             An industrialist-turned-party-hopping politician has been fielded by BJP in Allahabad South assembly segment with the hope that the man who had ended its winning streak in the constituency a decade ago as a BSP man, might now wrest the seat from SP.

On February 23, when voters of the constituency will exercise their franchise, 43-year-old Nand Gopal Gupta ""Nandi"" shall be looking forward to avenging the defeat of 2012 at the hands of sitting Samajwadi Party MLA Haji Parvez, to whom he had lost by a slender margin of less than 400 votes.

While Mr Gupta is the BJP candidate this time, the BSP - which expelled him three years ago - has fielded Mashooq Khan as part of a strategy to give a substantial number of tickets to those belonging to minority community.

 The Congress, which Mr Gupta had joined upon his expulsion from BSP and quit only last month, will end up supporting Mr Parvez owing to its alliance with the Samajwadi Party.

Mr Gupta's electoral debut in 2007 had caused the BJP to lose its grip over the assembly segment which it had never lost since 1989.

'Nandi' had defeated, by a margin of more than 14,000 votes, Keshri Nath Tripathi who was a five-time MLA, and had served thrice as the Uttar Pradesh assembly Speaker and was the BJP's state unit president at that time.

Emerging as the proverbial dark horse in an electoral contest that was being viewed as a ""clash of titans"", 'Nandi' had humbled Tripathi and relegated Rita Bahuguna Joshi, then the Congress woman's wing president and its future state unit chief, to the position of a distant third.

Interestingly, Mr Joshi, too, is contesting the current elections on a BJP ticket, from the Lucknow Cantt seat.

The BJP could not recover from the upset it suffered in 2007 as Tripathi finished third in the electoral contest five years later.

He has now moved out of the state on a gubernatorial assignment.","allahabad:"

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh is the incumbent parliamentarian from Lucknow.

Mr Vajpayee, 92, has been suffering from age-related ailments and has not been seen in public for years.

Thereafter, he could not vote in the assembly elections of 2007, 2012 as well as the Lok Sabha elections of 2009 and 2014,"" said Shiv Kumar, a close aide of the ailing leader, to news agency Press Trust of India.

He added that this time too, the former Prime Minister ""would be unable to cast his vote in the ongoing polls"".

BJP state spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi, commenting on Mr Vajpayee, said, ""Though Atalji would not be able to cast his vote for the party candidate, his blessings are always with us. With this, we would surge ahead in the electoral battlefield.""

Atal Bihar Vajpayee is a former three-time Prime Minister of India. His first term lasted for 13 days in 1996. His second term lasted from 1998 to 1999 whereas his third term came between 1999 and 2004. The BJP patriarch is the first non-Congress leader to complete a full-term as Prime Minister. Mr Vajpayee also holds the distinction of being the first Indian leader to deliver a speech in Hindi at the UN General Assembly.

Not At All, Say Yadavs","                             Law and order in Uttar Pradesh has been one of the main targets of the BJP in this assembly election in the state. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken of what his party alleges is the Yadav takeover of the state police. He had also spoken of discrimination, which he called the biggest problem of the state. Three days ago, at a rally in Barabanki, PM Modi said, ""Akhilesh-ji has turned police stations into Samajwadi Party offices. If you go to a police station, you will find the inspector and you will find 5-6 goondas"".

At the high-profile Saifai police station in the Yadav stronghold Etawah, Gopal Singh Yadav -- the latest in a two-decade list of Yadav in-charges, with just a few exceptions -- refuses to discuss the merit of his 2-month-old posting.

But six men sitting on the porch of the police station, sipping tea, say they are more than willing to discuss the merits of the Prime Minister's allegation. The men, who came to the police station to pay a courtesy call, are from the adjoining Zafarpur gram panchayat. Three of them are Samajwadi Party leaders and all are Yadavs. ","etawah:"

"42","Manipur Election 2017: Poor Representation Of Women In Candidate Lists Of Political Parties","                             Though women voters outnumber men in the electoral rolls in Manipur, only a small number of them have featured in the candidate lists of political parties in the upcoming state Assembly elections in Imphal.

The total number of voters in the state is around 19 lakh and the number of women voters is much higher than that of men.Women play an important role in Manipuri society but the number of women candidates put up by the political parties is far less when compared to that of men, sources from Election Commission said.

The ruling Congress and the BJP which are the main contenders in the upcoming polls have fielded only two candidates each. The TMC which came out with a list 24 candidates also has two women candidates.

Human rights activist Irom Sharmila's Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA), contesting from three seats has fielded two women, including Sharmila herself.

The National People's Party (NPP) has fielded only one woman candidate out of their 21 total number of candidates.

A senior Congress leader of Manipur state Congress unit said, ""Actually we had only received applications from four women candidates. Only two were given tickets based on their ability to win the seats. And secondly, in Manipur, women are not very much interested in politics.""

Keeping aside their ideological and political differences, the views of Congress were echoed by BJP state unit on this issue.

""We had given tickets based on the winning ability of candidates. And women are not very much interested in politics,"" a senior state BJP leader said.

But PRJA and TMC had different views on why a small number of women found place in candidate list.

""Out of three candidates that we had fielded two are women. This shows our commitment towards women empowerment. But the candidate list of big parties like BJP and Congress show that they are not at all interested in women politics. Shame on them,"" Erendro Leichonbam of PRJA said.

The TMC on the other hand blamed politics of violence and intimidation as the main reason behind the party not fielding women candidates.

""We wanted to field more women candidates. But we couldn't as there is a reign of terror and women are afraid to come out,"" TMC's leader in-charge of Manipur elections Samrat Tapadar told PTI.

In the outgoing state assembly, there are only three women MLAs and one of them is a minister in the state ministry.

Polling for the 60 seat Manipur Assembly will take place in two phases on March 4 and March 8 and the results will be declared on March 11.","imphal:"

 He asked the voters to shun dynastic and caste-based politics, noting that everything in the state veered around one family.

""What has this family given you? There are problems for farmers while law and order machinery in the state has collapsed. There is acute shortage of water and medicines. What has this state government done for you?"" he asked.

""For the past 50 years, only one family is running the affairs of Amethi. Even then, this place is languishing behind other districts in terms of development,"" he said.","amethi:"

The fourth phase of the election, scheduled for Thursday, will witness voters in 53 constituencies across 12 districts, including Raebareli, Allahabad and Jhansi. Yesterday, at a rally in Fatehpur, the Prime Minister had mocked Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for trying up with the Congress. He also took potshots at the ruling Samajwadi Party government for the lack of basic amenities such as electricity in the state. He also said that discrimination on basis of caste and religion is one of the biggest issues that plague Uttar Pradesh.

The high-octane assembly elections are currently underway in India's most populous state, which is expected to lay the groundwork for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While the Samajwadi Party seeks to retain the state, this time with the Congress, the BJP and the Mayawati-led BSP are fighting to make a comeback.

Here are the live updates of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech in Orai:Ram, Ram to everyone.I have had the good fortune of coming here over the years.The last time when I took the yatra from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, I had come here.You have come here in large numbers to bless the BJP, and I thank you.The election is not just about what the government or what minister will come to power. It is much bigger than that.UP's development is in tatters. But Bundelkhand has been hit the worst.Such governments have been elected in UP; they have destroyed you.SP, BSP, Congress - they are different sides of the same coin.Don't listen to them. Don't even listen to me. But ask your soul.Whoever has come to power, they have all robbed you.The BJP promises you: the next government will UP will have the provision to listen to Bundelkhand.Special measures will be taken to solve the problems of Bundelkhand.After the BJP government is formed in UP, a special board for Bundelkhand's development will be formed under the chief minister. A weekly record will be sought from it.At 8 pm on November 8, I said the ones who have looted the poor will have to pay back.Aren;t the SP and BSP staunch rivals? But I was amazed when all the opposition parties started speaking in one voice when I banned 500 and 1000 rupee notes and asked for records of black money hoarders.Behenji (Mayawati) said there was not enough planning. I asked her, planning by the government or you?She said a week should have been given. Had I done that, the people who looted would have vanished. The money would not have come to banks.Her problem is that she did not get enough time to prepare.Her question is why the accounts of her brother are being talked about. She accuses that it is so because of the elections.No, Behenji. It is because you deposited 100 crore just after the notes ban.BSP no longer Bahujan Samaj Party...it is now Behenji Sampatti Party","orai:"
"49","Midterm Polls In Maharashtra Inevitable, Says Sharad Pawar","                             Warning that midterm assembly elections in Maharashtra were ""inevitable"", Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar on Saturday said there was no question of his party propping up the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the state.

Mr Pawar told the media that he was even ready to put down his decision in writing and submit a copy to the Governor.

""I can right now give a letter to this effect and forward it to the Governor. But even Shiv Sena should submit a similar letter to him and make it public,"" Mr Pawar added, putting the ball in the Sena court over the fate of the government headed by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.

The Shiv Sena in the past few weeks has bitterly criticised the BJP in the state and at the Centre, saying the Maharashtra government was, ""on a notice period"", indicating it may withdraw support after the outcome of the civic elections on February 23.

Soon after the 2014 October assembly elections, the NCP had extended outside support to the BJP's minority government as Shiv Sena sat in the opposition for a month.

Around a month later, the Sena left the opposition benches to join the BJP as an ally.

The NCP chief had then justified its decision to provide external support to the BJP, ""in the interest of political stability and to avoid a fresh round of elections"".

In the past assembly elections, Maharashtra threw up a fractured house as all the main parties had contested separately and against each other.

Attacking the Centre for demonetisation, Mr Pawar said the November 8 move had resulted in massive losses in the farming sector and rural areas, besides job losses in the economy.

Questioning Mr Fadnavis's claims on the ""transparency agenda"", Mr Pawar demanded to know how the BJP could spend so much money on advertisements and publicity for the ongoing civic elections in Maharashtra.

Referring to a demand by the BJP to ban the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana Group of Publications for some days during the election period, Mr the NCP president said this indicated ""dictatorial"" attitude on the central government's part and expressed his opposition to it.","mumbai:"

A total of 2.41 crore voters will decide the fate of 826 candidates.

There are 1.31 crore men, 1.10 crore women and 1,026 voters from the third gender who will exercise their franchise on February 19, a poll official said.

There are 16,671 polling centres and 25,603 polling stations in this phase.

The 12 districts where polling is scheduled to begin at 7 am are Farrukhabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, Hardoi, Kannauj, Kanpur rural, Kanpur city, Unnao, Lucknow, Barabanki, Auraiyya and Sitapur.

Prominent personalities whose fate would be decided in this phase include Ministers Arvind Singh 'Gop', Fareed Mehfooz Kidwai, Vijay Bahadur Pal, Abhishek Mishra, Nitin Agarwal, Narendra Verma, Rajeev Kumar Singh and former Minister Shivpal Singh Yadav.

The maximum number of candidates in fray are from Etawah (21) -- the home town of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, while the least number is in Haidergarh (3) assembly constituency of Barabanki, neighbouring the state capital in Lucknow.

Lucknow Central and Lucknow West have 17 candidates each, while Farrukhabad and Bhojpur have 20 each.

The third phase comes as the biggest litmus test for the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) as it held 55 of these 69 seats in the 2012 assembly polls.

Of the remaining seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) held six, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) five and Congress two in the last election. One seat was won by an independent.

Other than the stronghold of Etawah, which is the home turf of the Yadav clan, the popularity of Akhilesh Yadav is also up for test, especially after the ugly power struggle that was witnessed over the past few months in the state's first family and the ruling party.

Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav has not campaigned for the SP which he founded 25 years ago.

Sullen at his unceremonious ouster by son Akhilesh Yadav in January from the post of national president, Mulayam Singh has only sought votes for his younger brother Shivpal Yadav, who is contesting from the Jaswantnagar seat in Etawah and daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, who is a candidate from Lucknow Cantonment.","lucknow:"

Third phase of Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh slated for February 19
                                Campaigning for her party - the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Union minister Smriti Irani took on Priyanka Gandhi, whose brother and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has teamed up with the Samajwadi Party and Akhilesh Yadav for the ongoing Assembly elections in the state. Speaking about the people of Amethi, a key constituency for the Congress, Ms Irani said that Priyanka Gandhi is not campaigning here because she cannot face the people and their questions. Ms Irani, who was addressing a press conference in Amethi, said that despite losing the Lok Sabha election from Amethi in 2014 to Rahul Gandhi she has been working regularly for the people of the constituency.

Priyanka Gandhi, however, has been avoiding to campaign in Amethi because of ""unfulfilled promises,"" Ms Irani said, claiming that ""Priyanka (Gandhi) wants to avoid people's questions.""

Speaking about Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi forming a Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance in the state, Ms Irani said, ""(Chief Minister) Akhilesh Yadav went with Congress because he was not confident.""

When asked whether she would be the BJP's chief ministerial candidate if the party comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, Ms Irani evaded the question by saying that currently every BJP worker is focusing on the job at hand and wants to see the BJP win.

Speaking about the BSP and its chief Mayawati's recent comments targeting the BJP, Ms Irani said that Ms Mayawati just wants to ""remain in headlines"".

Uttar Pradesh, which is scheduled to vote in seven phases, has already finished the first two phases of polling. The third phase is scheduled for February 19. The counting of votes will take place on March 11.","amethi:"

""Buaji (Mayawati) is saying she will sit in the opposition if she is unable to form government. Elections are not over yet, but she is ready to sit in the opposition.

""She cannot be relied upon. She can join hands with anyone. She had celebrated 'Rakshabandhan' with a BJP leader earlier and she can do it in the future also,"" Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said at an election rally in Unnao.

His remarks came after the BSP chief said that she would rather be in the opposition than form an alliance with BJP to form the government in Uttar Pradesh and accused the BJP of spreading rumours of a coalition with BSP.

The chief minister also asked policemen to vote for him, stating that his government gave maximum promotions and made recruitments in the force.

He, however, cautioned policemen against taking bribe and said anyone accepting money from the people would be tracked if any complaint was received on ""Dial UP 100"" platform.

Mr Yadav also highlighted schemes launched by his government for the welfare of the people and sought their support in the election.

"55","UP Elections 2017: With Eid, Holi Reference, PM Narendra Modi Accuses Akhilesh Yadav Of 'Discrimination'"," HighlightsPM Modi said discrimination is the biggest problem in Uttar Pradesh
SP has insulted Ram Manohar Lohia by forging alliance with Congress: PM
Fatehpur will vote on February 23 in the fourth phase of assembly polls
                                Prime Minster Narendra Modi on Sunday attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, accusing his Samajwadi Party government of politics of religion and caste discrimination. He was campaigning in Fatehpur, as UP voted in other parts of the state in the third of seven phases of the assembly elections.

""In Uttar Pradesh, everyone feels that they are being discriminated and they are being denied their rights,"" the Prime Minister said at an election rally. ""If a village has a graveyard it should also have a cremation ground. If there's electricity on Ramzan, it should also be there on Diwali. There must be bijli (power) both on Eid and Holi... There should be no discrimination,"" he said, accusing the Samajwadi Party of minority appeasement.

In Akhilesh Yadav's tenure, PM Modi said, ""The Dalits complain that their share is given to the Other Backward Classes, who in turn point a finger towards Muslims and Yadavs, while Yadavs say that only the family people get the benefits.""

The Prime Minister pitched schemes of the centre which, he said, benefit everyone irrespective of caste or religion and accused the state government of corruption. No one can get jobs without recommendations or the bribe, he said, urging people to elect the BJP for a change.

The BJP, which had swept Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 General Elections winning 71 of its 80 seats, is hoping to follow that up with as big a win in these assembly elections, it has not been in power in the state for the last 15 years. Instead of fielding a candidate for the Chief Minister's post, it has built its campaign around PM Modi's appeal and his development mantra.

Sixty-nine assembly constituencies of Uttar Pradesh spread across 12 districts voted today in the third phase of the seven-phase assembly elections seen by many as a precursor to the 2019 national polls. Fatehpur will vote on February 23 in the fourth phase.","fatehpur, uttar pradesh:"
"56","Manipur Elections 2017: Why Targeting The Young Voters Will Be Key","                             Campaigning is gaining momentum in Manipur, where the ruling Congress - which has been in power for 15 years - is locked in a battle for survival against the BJP which has made inroads in this Congress bastion. In all the 60 seats of Manipur, a key factor for winning will be who gets more votes of the youth and first time voters.

BJP's first star campaigner for Manipur, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, landed today and held whirlwind meetings before leaving for New Delhi. He predictably talked about the over 100 day-old economic blockade and the permanent peace agreement with NSCN(IM), the militant group that's currently on ceasefire mode.

More than hostilities, the Home Minister focused on creating avenues for the youth. Manipur, with nearly 80 per cent literacy levels, has a higher unemployment rate than the national average.

""We have taken a decision that we will provide loans to at minimum rate for those who are unemployed. I was surprised when I got to know that in the last 15 years there were 600 bandhs in the state. Even after having a stable government for so long why there were so many bandhs?"" Rajnath Singh said while releasing the vision document of the BJP in Imphal.

Manipur has over 19 lakh voters and 40 per cent of them are youth. More than 50 thousand are first time voters. Every political party wants to target the first timers.

And the entry of the Iron Lady Irom Sharmila, who's been fighting against tough military laws in the state, has made these elections a multi-cornered contest.

""I want to support sister Sharmila and her party because they are talking of clean politics, no matter if she wins or loses I will support her cause,"" said RK Bikramjit, Software Developer in Imphal.

In the hills of Manipur, young voters are key. ""Actually we all Nagas support NPF morally but I think the BJP is also strong,"" said Smith, a young voter from Senapati district in Manipur.

His friend Christina said: ""I was to change ... there is lot of corruption, this time around I want to change that.""

The popularity graph for the ruling Congress among young people in Manipur had been going down but in Ibobi Singh the Congress still has a chief ministerial candidate whom the youths are not writing off.

""There have been some issues with Ibobi rule, but there has been several good projects as well and that's why we are once again supporting him to become CM again,"" said Sudhir Singh, a young Congress supporter from Thoubal, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh's constituency where Irom Sharmila is taking on the three time Chief Minister.

If the Congress wants to reach the majority mark of 31 in the 60 member assembly, it surely needs the young voters who are being wooed by both the BJP and Irom Sharmila.","imphal:"

For the first time, the party is contesting 40 seats in Uttar Pradesh - in the last state election five years ago, it did not participate. The quantum leap reflects Asaduddin Owaisi's ambition to turn his outfit into a national party with power extending far beyond its traditional reach of Telangana.

Shafiqur Rehman Barq is not the candidate from Sambhal, where Muslims form more than 65 per cent of the population. But for decades, he has been the area's undisputed political overlord, representing it both in parliament and in the state legislature. A four-time Lok Sabha member, he began his career with the Samajwadi Party: ""I was there when Mulayam Singh laid its foundation."" In the 2009 general elections, he left Mulayam Singh, who did not choose him as a candidate, and successfully ran for parliament from Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party. In 2014, he switched back, but lost his bid by just 5,000 votes. ""I was betrayed by my own party,"" he says, alleging that a political rival, Iqbal Mehmood, worked to ensure his defeat.

Ms Sharmila, 44, who recently launched her political party Peoples' Resurgence And Justice Alliance (PRAJA), is contesting against the 68-year-old Chief Minister.

NDTV caught up with Ms Sharmila during her campaign as she spoke at length on why she is taking a plunge into politics, why she turned down an offer from the BJP and also her take on the economic blockade that has paralysed the state.

NDTV: You have given up your hunger strike and said that now the fight will be taken up politically and you want to take it right inside the legislative assembly. How has the journey into politics been so far?

Irom Sharmila: People's reaction is mixed. They come to realise the real being of me. They come to know about my sense of humanity. Here in Thoubal, I am sitting and discussing with the local community. They are happy about my new step. They all want to see a change and they are fed up of the three terms of the Congress.

NDTV: You want to bring change and a new social order in Manipur. The BJP is also talking of change. What is your opinion on the BJP?

Irom Sharmila: I was approached by the BJP to fight on their ticket in this election. Their suggestion was that to fight Ibobi, I will need 36 crores. If I have it, I should produce it, if not the centre would sanction it. On that condition, I said I will stand for elections as an independent. I don't criticise other political parties. I just want to bring a change in the society. I want to bring the right to justice to all and ensure that the draconian AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) is withdrawn.

NDTV: Before you launched your political party - PRAJA - you had met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and many in Manipur are now saying that you are trying to repeat what Mr Kejriwal did in Delhi. What was his tip for you?

Irom Sharmila: He just wanted me to be successful in bringing real democracy in the society and wanted me to connect with people and he gave brotherly advice.

"64","Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Campaign Ends For Phase-2","                             Political parties paused campaigning in close to 67 constituencies of western Uttar Pradesh figuring in the second phase of the seven-phase Assembly election in the state on February 15.

The constituencies are spread across 11 districts -- Saharanpur, Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal, Rampur, Bareilly, Amroha, Pilibhit, Kheri, Shahjahanpur and Badaun.

Of the 67 seats at stake, ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) had won 34 in 2012, followed by BSP 18, BJP 10, Congress 3 and others 2.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah championed the cause of the saffron party during the campaigning, the SP-Congress alliance's charge was spearheaded by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, besides other leaders of the respective parties.

BSP chief Mayawati wooed the voters addressing one rally after another all by herself, with senior party leader SC Misra chipping in at certain places.

Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah slammed the Congress and SP, saying Rahul Gandhi ran a campaign against the SP government and wondered what change of heart made them embrace each other now.

Mr Yadav and Mr Gandhi harped on demonetisation, alleging that PM Modi's notes ban decision had caused immense hardship to those living in the rural areas.

Keeping in mind that western Uttar Pradesh had vast tracts of agricultural land, PM Modi played the pro-poor and pro-farmers card and reiterated BJP's promise of waiving loans of small and marginal farmers and paying the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.

Interestingly, political bigwigs, including SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress president Sonia Gandhi were conspicuous by their absence from the campaign trail in the first two phases of polling.","lucknow:"

Attacking Samajwadi Party, the BSP chief assured the voters that she would rid the state of ""prevailing jungle raj"" by putting criminals behind bars and urged Muslims not to waste their votes on SP. ""The first phase of UP polls was encouraging for BSP. It was a clean sweep for our party. It's a positive signal that we are going to form government in the state,"" she told an election rally Sitapur.

On SP-Congress alliance, she said, ""It is political opportunism as Congress joined hands with a government which works on BJP's guidelines.""

""Samajwadi government only gave lawlessness and corruption with over 500 riots,"" she claimed, adding voters of SP are divided in two factions now.

""Shivpal Yadav will damage SP because he was insulted by Mulayam Singh due to his affection for son Akhilesh,"" Ms Mayawati said and appealed to minority voters not to support SP.

On BJP, Ms Mayawati claimed demonetisation was a painful decision for 90 per cent farmers, workers and the poor and Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured only the capitalists and the rich.

She charged the Prime Minister with working under RSS directives.

Ms Mayawati recalled the suicide of dalit student Rohit Vemula at Hyderabad Central University and the assault on dalits who allegedly skinned a dead cow in Una in Gujarat, warning that such incidents would happen in Uttar Pradesh if BJP came to power.

She dubbed as ""fake"" the surveys and opinion polls that said BSP will not come to power and said that they will be proved wrong as in 2007, when her party got majority.

""You should not believe in such surveys. If BSP came to power all development schemes will be restarted and names of schemes and places that were changed will be restored,"" she said.

""Employment will be given to young men and women instead of laptops and phones,"" she said, asking minority voters to help BSP get majority in the elections.","sitapur, uttar pradesh:"

Incidentally, all these states are presently governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the same breath, the leader expressed confidence that Aam Aadmi Party, led by Arvind Kejriwal, will perform exceedingly well in Punjab and Goa where it is contesting against both the BJP and the Congress.

Mr Sisodia, who is the in-charge of the party affairs in Rajasthan, said, ""In Rajasthan, people are disappointed with BJP rule and they are not willing to trust the Congress. After every Assembly elections, the face changes but governance remains the same. ""In such a scenario, people are looking at AAP with hope.""

""On March 11 when results will be out, we are confident of winning big number of seats in Punjab and in Goa too we are sure of performing well and securing good number of seats,"" Mr Sisodia, who was here to review the party's organisational matters, said at a press interaction.

In reply to a question, Mr Sisodia said that his party will welcome all leaders, including rebels from other political parties, to its fold if they are not corrupt, and have clean characters.

Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he claimed that because of demonetisation, trade, industry and the common man have suffered heavily. ""Those in possession of black money got their money exchanged from back doors, while the aam aadmi, like the farmers and the labourers, had to stand in queues to withdraw their own hard earned money,"" Mr Sisodia said.

Mr Sisodia, claimed the AAP government in Delhi has accelerated development, reduced power tariff and improved the education sector.

The Uttar Pradesh election is considered to be a high-octane three-way contest between the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, the BJP and BSP. While the Samajwadi Party seeks to retain the state - albeit with the Congress this time, the BSP and BJP hope to regain power in the state after five and 13 years respectively.

The voter turnout in the first phase was recorded at 64.2 per cent - an increase of nearly three per cent from the first phase turnout in 2012.

Residents of Uttarakhand voted today to decide who will form the next government in the state. The overall voter turnout was 68%, which is 1.2% higher than the 2012 Assembly election (66.8%). The BJP is hoping to unseat the ruling Congress government of Chief Minister Harish Rawat, which is battling corruption charges. Out of a total of 70 constituencies, 69 have voted today and 1 constituency - Karnaprayag will vote on March 9 because of the untimely death of BSP candidate Kuldeep Singh Kanwasi, who met with a fatal accident recently. Karnaprayag is a high profile constituency from where Deputy Speaker of the state assembly Anusuya Prasad Maikhuri is contesting. The security level across the hill state had been heightened, especially along the border with Nepal. Anti-incumbency has always been a factor in Uttarakhand, which has voted out the government in power at the time, in successive elections since its formation. Chief Minister Harish Rawat contested from Haridwar Rural in Garhwal against sitting BJP legislator Swami Yatishwaranand, banking on the Muslim and Dalit voters in the city that is one of the largest pilgrim centres of the country. The BJP has accused the Congress of turning ""Dev Bhoomi"" Uttarakhand, meaning the land of Gods to ""Loot Bhoomi"" - the land of corruption. For Chief Minister Rawat, the battle was seen as uphill and he also contested from Kichcha in Kumaon. The Congress had portrayed this as his attempt to reaffirm the party's commitment to both Kumaon and Garhwal. His detractors saw this as a last-ditch attempt to save the party in seats where up to 12 leaders have defected, leading to instability and a loss of face for the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged people of Uttarakhand to come out and vote in large numbers. A high voter turnout would indicate a change in government. In 2012, Uttarakhand saw a voter turnout of 67.22 per cent. Uttarakhand voted in a single phase. Counting of votes will take place on March 11.

Irom Sharmila, the feisty activist of Manipur, who recently launched her party PRAJA or the Peoples Resurgence and Justice Alliance, dropped her hat in the poll ring to take the fight against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA politically and is contesting against three-time Chief Minister of the Congress.

""The local communities are happy and positive about my new step. They want to see change and they are fed up of the Congress,"" said Ms Sharmila.

Unlike for Mr Singh, Thoubal is not her home, but many have warmed up to her egalitarian ways. Wider public sentiment, however, still remains divided between the leaders.

Supporters of Ms Sharmila look at her as someone capable of ushering in change, while those on Mr Singh's side are confident that he will win.

""Ibobi Singh has won several times. But now with Sharmila, we feel there can be a real change. With her fight against AFSPA in the assembly, the situation might improve,"" said a local voter Kamala Devi.

The constituency abutting Delhi recorded a voter turnout of 58.18 percent.

The triangular contest here is between BJP's Pankaj Singh, the son of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Samajwadi Party's Sunil Choudhary and Bahujan Samaj Party's Ravikant Mishra.

Sabhajit Yadav, an auto driver who lives in Sector 8, said he was very disappointed on not finding his name in the voters list.

""My name was missing from the list. An Anganwadi worker came to my house to get the names verified. But when I went to cast my vote, they said my name was not in the Election Commission record,"" Yadav told IANS.

""We have been living here for more than 30 years. How is it possible that my name is not there on the list while my daughter's and my wife's names are there,"" he added.

A polling agent of Samajwadi Party in Sector 11 said there were complaints from a large number of people about their names being missing. An agent of the BJP in the area also seconded him.

Richa Bala, who came to the polling booth at Ghijor village, said that she had voted in the 2014 Lok Sabha election but was unable do so in this election.

Bala's friend, who was accompanying her, said she had called the prescribed toll number to lodge a complaint and got to know that 2,000 such complaints had already been made.

Lalita, who runs a shop at Ghijor village, also rued that she could not vote.

""I have been casting my vote here for the past 25 years. This time my name is missing from the list. My husband's name is there, but not mine,"" she said.

A booth level officer at Ghijor said they could not help those whose names were missing.

""If a person's name is there at multiple places, it gets deleted. People have to take care that they are properly registered at one address only,"" he said.

Contacted, Kumar Vineet, Additional District Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the list was publicised many times.

He said people whose names are missing might not have checked the list.

""There could be many reasons. They should have verified their names in the voters list before the elections,"" Vineet told IANS.

Some voters did not hesitate to express their preferences.

""There is hope that Sunil Choudhury will win. He is an old candidate from Noida. With BSP contesting this time, BJP will lose votes,"" Mandal added.

The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 Union elections, decimating the Congress, SP and BSP - which were reduced to five, two and zero seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The election in Uttar Pradesh - along with those in Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand - is considered to be a referendum on PM Modi's demonetisation drive. In his campaigns across Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi urged voters to root out 'SCAM' - an acronym for Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.

Ms Mayawati is expected to be a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, should the BSP win. Her party was the worst sufferer in the state in the 2014 Union elections as it failed to register a single seat. This time, the party has fielded a record number of candidates belonging to the Muslim community, considered to be a key vote bank for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.

The poll is also a crucial test for the new national president of Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, who gained control of the party after a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister has forged an alliance with the Congress and lately, Rahul Gandhi and Mr Yadav have been jointly campaigning all over Uttar Pradesh. The Congress will contest 24 seats whereas the Samajwadi Party has given tickets to 51 contestants in the first-phase.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an incumbent Lok Sabha member from Varanasi whereas Congress' top leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are parliamentarians from Raebareli and Amethi, respectively.

"85","UP Elections 2017: Battleground Saharanpur Is Big Test For Congress, BSP","                             As Saharanpur goes to polls on Wednesday, the stakes are the highest for the Congress - its campaign spearheaded by its firebrand UP vice-president Imran Masood. The party is contesting five of the seven assembly seats in the region, where Mayawati's attempts to forge a Muslim-Dalit combination will also be put to test.

More than 40% of the people in this fertile agricultural belt, home to one of the most influential Islamic seminaries, the Darul Uloom Deoband, are Muslims. The Dalit population is around 22%. Large pockets of the Gujjar community are also there, especially in seats like Gangoh and Nakur. The latter is the seat from where Imran Masood, one of Congress' four state vice presidents, is contesting.

Mr Masood hit the headlines in 2014, when he was arrested for a hate speech against Narendra Modi, an image he wants to put behind. ""Look, to say botti botti (chopping into pieces) is... the sort of language we use colloquially... I have already said I was wrong. My politics is not of hate, and people know that,"" Masood tells NDTV.
Not everyone is as convinced.

Muzzafarnagar is next door, points out BJP supporter Dr Gupta, and after the riots and the tenor of the speeches of the BJP leaders, Muslims were looking for more dabang (fearless) Muslim leaders. But he too concedes that ""Imran has charisma and is always ready to listen to people's problems.""

Mr Masood moved out of the Samajwadi Party in 2013 to join the Congress. Now seen as a favourite of party vice president Rahul Gandhi, he is reported to have influenced the choice of candidates in all seven seats. From one seat, Gangoh, he even fielded his brother Noman.

Mr Masood is ebullient about how the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance would sweep the elections under Rahul Gandhi, whom he calls the country's ""most dynamic leader"" and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, ""the face of development"".

It is this image of power, real and sometimes exaggerated, that makes Mr Masood the chief target for his rivals. His challenges come from many quarters.

Closer home, it is his uncle Rashid Masood, who has been upset that his nephew, and not his son Shadan, was being promoted within the Congress.

Mr Masood also has to assuage angry Gujjars, who accuse him of sabotaging tickets to Gujjar candidates such as Mukesh Chowdhury. ""Please don't be angry with me,"" he tells an audience of 150 Gujjars at Mohdipur village, attempting to placate clan elders.

A short distance away, outside their huts in the poorest part of the village, a few Dalit women listen to him. But they have already made up their minds. ""We only vote for the elephant,"" they say.

The sentiment is echoed other parts of Saharanpur.

Behat sent BSP candidates to the Lok Sabha and state assembly in the last elections. ""If Mayawati gives an elephant a ticket from Behat, we will vote for it,"" says Gagan, an elderly shopkeeper from Alampur village.

The BSP has fielded Mohammad Iqbal, better known as Haji Iqbal, from Behat. For someone who had run into trouble with the Enforcement Directorate, it is no surprise that his wealth and the sprawling Glocal campus, an educational institute he set up, is a talking point. In his election affidavit, he had declared assets to the tune of 14 crore rupees.

""Haji Iqbal is the BSP's big leader and he's the one giving Masood sleepless nights,"" says Obaid, an engineer. But he is countered by colleague Sadat, who bets on Imran's popularity. The Congress nominee from the seat is Naresh Saini, but the contest in Behat has become a proxy battle between Haji Iqbal and Mr Masood.

There is another smaller, but embarrassing challenge for Mr Masood from within his own party. Saad Ali Khan, a man denied the Congress ticket is now fighting as an independent from the rural Saharanpur seat. Mr Khan, who hails from an elite family, insists he was a sure-shot winner and blames an insecure Masood of blocking his ticket.","saharanpur:"

"87","UP Election 2017: Ajit Singh's Party Tries to Stitch Together Rainbow Coalition",NA,"the rashtriya lok dal has ruled out any post-poll alliance with the bjp, enthused by reports that their traditional votebank in western uttar pradesh, the jats, are angry with the bjp and may return to fold. the jat support had swung to the bjp in 2014 lok sabha elections following the muzzaffarnagar riots, and the rld - which had won 9 seats in 2012 assembly elections -- had drawn a blank. but with the perceived failure of the bjp to deliver on its pre-election promise of reservation in government jobs, there are reports that the jat ire against the party has grown.

""i am focussed on polls and not looking at post-poll,"" jayant chaudhary, the son of party chief ajit singh, told ndtv. ""i can assure you that under no circumstances we are looking at the bjp as an alternative.""

as the longtime representative of jat concerns, the rld contends that the bjp has not kept the promises made to the jats in 2014. there is no reservation in government jobs, better support price to sugarcane farmers was not offered and dues to sugar cane farmers remain yet to be paid. this time, the bjp has promised that if voted to power, cane dues for farmers will be paid within a fortnight.

at election rallies like the one in kundarki constituency, a muslim-majority constituency on the outskirts of moradabad, mr chaudhary talks of building bridges between communities and thereby, a new political coalition.

""one party says the muslims are getting together, so hindus must all get together. another party talks about caste. i am saying all weavers, farmers, labourers should all unite,"" he declared at the rally, taking a dig at both the bjp and mayawati's bahujan samaj party.

but 90 km away in bijnore, there is palpable tension after a 17-year-old jat boy in nayagaon was killed and his father seriously injured. all the accused in the violence -- which took place three days ago -- are muslims, which created tension and underscored the trust deficit between the two communities.

the rld candidate from the area had to face a hostile crowed when he visited the victim's family. ""why can't it be treated like any other crime? why bring it a communal angle? such things should be banned. do bjp leaders visit the victims of 5,000 murders and 2,000 rapes?"" mr chaudhury questioned.

a group of muslim cushion makers at kundarki, located next to mr chaudhary's rally in moradabad, downplay his attempts at a rainbow coalition. ""we think it is a party of the jats and we won't be able to vote for them,"" says tahir, one of the workers busy stitching the cover of a cushion.

the sentiment is reciprocated 5 kilometres away in jatupura -- a village dominated by jatavs but which has hundreds of jat families."

As people try to cope with the shortage of essential items, the Centre today called in two Naga leaders, who are in a jail in Manipur for allegedly masterminding the blockade, for talks.

The blockade had started on November 1 last year after Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh carved out seven new districts in the state. It has made life miserable for voters, with cooking gas shooting up to Rs. 2000 a cylinder in the black market.

Ms Sharmila will contest from Thoubal seat, convenor of her party People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) Erendro Leichonbam, said.

Known for her fight against Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Ms Sharmila is a political greenhorn while Congress has been in power in Manipur for three successive terms under Ibobi Singh.

Congress on February 3 had released a list of 60 candidates for Manipur Assembly elections, with Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh contesting Thoubal seat.

In August last year, the 44-year-old Iron Lady broke her 16-year-old hunger strike, the world's longest such campaign, and declared that she wants to become the chief minister so that she could press for repeal of the contentious AFSPA.

While launching her party PRJA in October last year, Ms Sharmila had said she would contest from two seats - Thoubal and Khurai. While she belongs to Khurai, Thoubal is the Assembly constituency of the Chief Minister.

Leichonbam said the party has already started campaigning in Thoubal for Ms Sharmila.

However, there is no word yet about her contesting Khurai seat.

Ms Leichonbam said PRJA, which recently was allotted 'whistle' as the party's symbol, is likely to field altogether 10 candidates for the Assembly elections to be held on March 4 and 8.

Meanwhile, the Naga People's Front (NPF), the ruling party in Nagaland, has announced names of 15 candidates for the Manipur Assembly elections.","imphal:"

The five-hour rally featuring Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and partner Rahul Gandhi of the Congress had been designed to draw attention to the young leaders as another part of the state voted. A strategy that was first tested by PM Modi in the national election of 2014.

The plan was to divert attention with the hype around a big joint rally in the PM's constituency in eastern UP, while western UP, where the BJP is seen as strong, voted.

The Congress has said that tomorrow's road show was cancelled because the administration withdrew permission earlier granted, citing celebrations in the area of the birth anniversary of a saint Guru Ravidas. The road show would be held another day, the party said.

Varanasi's District Magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra however told NDTV that officials had been informed of ""no such programme for February 11,"" and sources said a clash of dates scuttled the road show. The Congress, before fixing the date had apparently failed to check with Akhilesh Yadav, who had already committed the date to campaigning in other parts of the states.

The money, a third of her Rs 32,000 that she had declared as her assets in the election affidavit, was for the security deposit.

Ms Sharma says the struggle to get her family's support was a challenge.

""My parents wanted to marry me off, this is my last resort. I need to make something of myself,"" said Ms Sharma.

Ms Sharma is pursuing her graduation in Arts from Agra college. Her battles, however, aren't only about her life.

""My village has no basic amenities. There are no colleges nearby. Girls have to be accompanied by a male member if they step out. And we can't step out after 6pm... In 21st century India, this has to change,"" says Ms Sharma, a farmer's daughter.

During campaigning in the village, Ms Sharma promised to improve the lives of women through quality education, better healthcare and a safer environment.

""I will definitely vote for her, we have spent our lives inside the house, our daughters must step out,"" said Sarla Devi.

But it is mostly a lonely battle for her. Her youngest brother who has just completed his post-graduation, Sushil Sharma, is the only one by her side.

""No one supported her initially, no one spoke to her, she went alone to file her nomination, but after seeing her work so hard, I decided to help her,"" Sushil said.

The re-poll will be held on February 9. It was ordered in the wake of the malfunctioning of Voter-Verified Audit Paper Trail (VVPAT) and Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in these stations during the polling.

The re-polling has been ordered at 12 polling stations of Majitha Assembly seat, nine each of Muktsar and Sangrur, one each of Moga and Sardulgarh and 16 polling stations of Amritsar Parliamentary constituency, official said.

""The re-polling will take place at 48 polling stations because of the malfunctioning that occurred in some VVPATs and EVMs on the polling day. The re-polling will take place on February 9,"" Punjab Chief Electoral Officer VK Singh said.

Mr Singh said the polling hours shall be from 8 am to 5 pm and all the voters queued up till 5 pm at the polling stations can cast their votes.

Punjab CEO said necessary arrangements have been made and election material, EVMs, security and poll staff in adequate numbers have been deputed for this task.

""The central paramilitary force will be deployed at each polling station and no outsider will be allowed to stay,"" he said.

Despite facing problems in VVPAT, the Election Commission said they will be used during the re-poll.

""VVPATs will be used during the re-poll. A total of 47 VVPATs will be deployed at the polling stations and sufficient numbers of machines have been kept as reserve,"" he said.

Problem in VVPAT was witnessed in Majithia, Muktsar and Sangrur assembly segments while EVMs were found faulty in Moga and Sardulgarh segments.

No VVPAT was used in Sardulgarh segment, said CEO. EC had used VVPAT for the first time in Punjab at 6,668 polling stations in 33 Assembly segments and two segments in Amritsar Lok Sabha seat.

During the mock polls, 538 VVPATs were replaced while during polling 187 VVPATs were replaced.

Polling was affected at 25 polling stations in Majitha and ten each in Sangrur and Muktsar because of VVPAT malfunctioning.

VVPAT generates a receipt and allows people to verify the vote went in favour of the candidate against whose name the button was pressed on the electronic voting machine.

In one polling station each of Moga and Sardulgarh segments, EVMs had displayed the votes cast during mock polls despite the polling beginning at 8 am.

CEO said the officials at polling station in Moga and Sardulgrah where problems in EVM surfaced, maintained that they had pressed the 'clear' button to clear the votes polled during mock polls.","chandigarh:"

Addressing an election rally in Aligarh, PM Modi said that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was desperately trying to seek the help of anything to retain power.

PM Modi said that Samajwadi Party government has done ""nothing"" for development in the state. ""When the wind is so strong, even a young leader cannot face it and seeks help of anything ...even a pole...but this time BJP 'aandhi' (storm) is so strong that the Chief Minister fears that he might be blown off... The people of UP want change and justice,"" the PM said.

He used his signature style of coining acronyms to assert that BJP will bring ""Vikas"" - 'Vidyut' (electricity), 'Kanoon' (law and order) and 'Sadak' (roads), if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh.

 The Prime Minister said that his government's efforts to weed out black money from the country has created fear among opposition parties. ""We are working to save money by adopting strict measures. Will they not be angry with me and will not come together to defeat Modi? ...They feel that if they remain alone, Modi will get majority in the Rajya Sabha and make such rules that thieves, looters and the corrupt will not get any help. This is their fear,"" he said.

The Prime Minister said that Rs 40,000 crores from the treasury has been saved by linking aadhar cards and bank accounts to the central government's pension schemes which was being misused by the corrupt.

PM Modi also attacked the Akhilesh Yadav government for ""doing nothing for development"" and accused it of neither checking corruption, casteism and nepotism, nor clearing the cane farmers' dues. ""Youths were asked to pay bribe and bring recommendation for interviews by MLAs and Ministers. Poor had to mortgage land and assets to pay. This has to be stopped,"" he said.

Claiming that ""the corrupt are flourishing under the current UP administration"", PM Modi said that his government has linked pension to Aadhaar and bank accounts to check corruption.

Punjab police intercepted cash amounting to Rs. 58 crore during special checking undertaken throughout the state and then handed over Rs. 25.33 crore to the Income Tax department for further investigation.

Police, however, after seizing Rs. 1.14 crore, released about Rs. 32 crore which belonged to some banks. Out of Rs. 25.33 crore, the income tax sleuths seized Rs. 8.38 crore and released Rs. 9.97 crore after verification. A sum of Rs. 7.35 crore was still under investigation, the official said.

Here are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech in Aligarh:Last time before the general elections when I visited Aligarh, the attendance was not even half of what it is today. I thank you all for your love and support.I see winds of change in Uttar Pradesh. The winds are fierce this time. The winds are so strong in favour of the BJP that the chief minister is holding on to just about anyone he can find.UP wants justice. Especially my sisters and mothers, my small time traders. This fight is for you.These days, people are issuing a fatwa against me every day. Because I am tightening the screws, because I am asking for an account of the crimes they committed over 70 years.It is shameful to see cases that have come to light here. It was found that people were withdrawing money of a widower's pension even when the woman does not exist. Tell me, is this not corruption? The corrupt are flourishing under the current UP administration. To stop this, from the Centre we have linked pension to Aadhaar and bank accounts. 40,000 crore that these rats would silently eat is now being saved.On November 8, I announced the banning of 500-and 1000-rupee notes. There was chaos amongst these corrupt people. They had to then deposit the money in bank accounts. We want that this money come to good use, for the benefit of our youth and development of our country. I am thankful to 1.2 billion people for supporting me.So many manufacturing plants were shut and Aligarh's famous locks came to use in order to lock them. You know the reason behind these plants shutting down? It happened because the UP government could not give them electricity.We are working day and night to ensure that every corner of India has electricity. We are making good progress. I am confident that electricity will reach every factory and household very soon. We are very close to achieving this. In fact we are working towards Uttar Pradesh's Vikas. By VIKAS I mean V - Vidyod (electricity), K - Kanoon (law and order), and S - Sadak (roads).The current government in Uttar Pradesh has nothing to do with vikas (development). But I want to assure the people of UP that we - the BJP - have taken this decision at the Centre to develop UP.Tell me, haven't you all faced injustice and discrimination? Let's take jobs for instance; Does one have to belong to a certain caste? or know someone who is connected politically to get a job? Is this what our constitution says? No. You all are facing this because of the current government in UP. They have failed you all. We will do our best to ensure that every young person in UP gets a job.Coming to the law and order situation in UP... Tell me, once the sun sets, can a sister or mother of any household leave their homes? Should women not have equal rights are men? Should the women be not given protection? I appeal to you all - my brothers and sisters - to save Uttar Pradesh from bullies and goons. Throw out these people who have done nothing for you, who have abandoned you, and left you without security. It is sad to see that if a person complaints about a bully or a goon, and he happens to be a relative of a politician, the complainant is scrapped. Are these the kind people who you want should run UP?To fight black money, corruption and counterfeit currency, we did demonetisation, then remonetised the economy and simultaneously started work of e-monetisation. We launched the BHIM app on Ambedkar's name. People questioned us, saying, what right does Narendra Modi have to use BR Ambedkar's name? I want to remind them that he was the economist under whom the Reserve Bank of India was formed. He was a great man and his contributions will never be forgotten. I don't care if people are jealous, but I will always honour him and hold him in highest regard.","aligarh:"

The Congress alleges that the Centre is soft on NSCN (IM), which is seen as the mastermind behind the blockade.

""We have been requesting the Centre that it has to talk to NSCN (IM) since it an pen truth that the UNC is working on their behest. It is the Centre who is talking peace with the NSCN(IM),"" said G Gaikhangam, deputy chief minister of Manipur.

The BJP was quick to counter the Congress' allegations.

""How can they say UNC is backed by NSCN(IM) and why do they not ban them. These are all baseless accusations. The Congress is to be blamed since it decided to create seven districts overnight,"" said N Biren Singh, a former Congress leader who is now with the BJP.

The UNC decided to continue with the protest despite signing an agreement earlier with the state government wherein the protestors agreed to consider lifting the blockade. The Centre had claimed that ""substantial progress"" was made to resolve the issue after the first round of talks between the stakeholders, held on February 3, in the national capital.

The over economic blockade - called by the UNC after the state government decided to bifurcate Naga dominated areas and create seven new districts - has crippled everyday life in Manipur.

Sources in the Election Commission said the authorities had taken a slew of steps in this regard.

Estimates of the 2012 assembly election revealed that as many as 488 polling stations were vulnerable to heavy snowfall.

This year's revised figures stand at 803. The identified booths, spread over 35 assembly constituencies, are located in the state's high-altitude zones, which bear the brunt of heavy snowfall every winter, especially in January and February.

Uttarakhand Chief Electoral Officer Radha Raturi said, ""Keeping in mind the high altitude and inclement weather conditions, several arrangements are being made to ensure that polling parties in the 803 stations reach their destination on time and have all the necessary facilities to cope with the bad winter conditions.""

""Each of the 803 polling stations would witness 8,000-10,000 voters this year,"" she added. The EC would provide 5,302 sleeping bags, high-altitude shoes and jackets to the officials assigned to the poll-duty.

Uttarakashi has the maximum number of snow-affected polling stations in the state (318), followed by Nainital (85) and Dehradun (76). Except Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar district, all other 11 districts have polling stations which receive heavy snowfall during winters.

The EC has also identified 212 snow-affected roads in the state, the maximum being in Chamoli district.

The district administration has been put on high alert to ensure that snowfall does not pose a challenge in the upcoming polls.

Earlier in the month, there were reports of about 100 families in remote Pithoragarh who had decided to boycott the election and complained to the EC after the administration had failed to provide a proper road access to the villages.","dehradun:"

In rallies across the state ahead of elections from Saturday, Akhilesh Yadav makes it a point to talk about Khazanchi, who was born two months ago, in a bank queue after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's notes ban, which has been criticized by opposition parties.

""A child was delivered while standing in the queue, I honoured the name that bank employees gave him (Khazanchi) and provided support of 2 lakh,"" Mr Yadav, also the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief, said at a recent rally in Kanpur, reminding his audience that it was only the poor, and not the rich, who bore the brunt.

Khazanchi's mother Sarvesha Devi had waited for five hours outside a bank branch in Jhinjhak town when she went into labour. The baby boy is her fifth child, born after the recent death of her husband, a snake charmer.

Bank employees and others suggested the newborn be named Khazanchi, which means treasurer or cashier. She agreed.

In times of elections, Khazanchi has been introduced early to the world of politics.

Well before he turned a month old, Akhilesh Yadav awarded Rs 2 lakh to his mother in a move perceived to be high on political symbolism; a high profile election in the state was just around the corner.

Back in their village around 40 km from the district headquarters, which has about 450 voters from backward castes, Khazanchi is fast asleep on the only cot the family has, outside their mud house.

""Yes, this baby boy has given me hope that I can survive,"" says Sarvesha Devi, sharing her daily struggle to make ends meet.

What is her view of the government's overnight ban on high value currency notes, which forced millions like her to spend hours in queues outside banks and ATMs for cash? She shrugs, ""Don't ask me about politics. I have no idea.""

Aruna Kori, a junior culture minister in Akhilesh government and local SP candidate for the Rasulabad seat that goes to vote on 19 February, conceded Khazanchi was a ""big part of her election campaign"". ""At least Akhilesh helped the child,"" she says, a rebuttal to BJP leaders who insist the baby's birth ""doesn't really prove anything"".

Kori's rival from the BJP, Nirmala Shankhwar, responded: ""If he is a star, he is a star for everyone and not just one political party... In the villages everyone is saying the notes ban was absolutely good"".","kanpur dehat:"

""Yes, there are some seats on which candidates of both the parties are challenging each other. The issue will be resolved,"" Samajwadi Party Chief Spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury told PTI when asked to comment on the issue.

Even Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar said the matter would be sorted out in a couple of days.

""Leaders of both parties will campaign in support of candidates declared by the alliance on the seats where nominees of both sides have filed their papers,"" he said. But, political observers said with only a day left for the first phase polling on February 11 the damage seems to have been done already with candidates of both parties already on the ground.

""The alliance is set to witness some unfriendly contest in these seats,"" said a political expert.

The situation is worse in the Gandhi family pocket borough - Amethi and Raebareli - represented by Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi in the Lok Sabha.

There are 10 assembly seats in Amethi and Raebareli. In Raebareli's Sareni seat, Ashok Singh (Congress) and Devendra Pratap Singh (Samajwadi Party) are challenging each other.

Likewise, in Unchahar Ajay Pal Singh (Congress) is facing cabinet minister Manoj Kumar Pandey (Samajwadi Party).

In Amethi, sitting MLA and Mulayam Singh Yadav loyalist Gayatri Prasad Prajapati is in the fray on SP ticket, while Congress has decided to field Amita Singh there.

In Gauriganj seat too, confusion prevails with Congress candidate Mohd Naeem challenging Rakesh Pratap Singh (Samajwadi Party).

The UP Pradesh Congress Committee chief, however, made light of the issue saying, Samajwadi Party candidates had filed their nomination papers when it appeared that the alliance will not come through.

""At some places they wanted to withdraw, they could not do so due to uncertainty,"" he said.

The statues built when Mayawati was the chief minister were covered in the 2012 Assembly polls on the orders of the election commission.

To a question on the possibility of covering statues of Mayawati and elephants, Chief Election Commissioner Naseem Zaidi on Thursday said, ""The Supreme Court has given directives in this connection and we have also given some guidelines in its pursuance... this issue is no more under the consideration of the commission.""

The CEC however did not elaborate on the directives of the apex court or poll panel guidelines in this regard. Mr Zaidi was here to review poll preparations in the 73 seats of western Uttar Pradesh which are going to polls on Saturday in the first of the seven phased Assembly elections.

To another question, Mr Zaidi said those who had migrated from Kairana for any reason will be extended security if they take part in the polling process in their respective areas.

Stressing that representatives of various political parties and officials met the commission in the past two days in Lucknow, Mr Zaidi said officials have been asked to give a declaration if any of their relatives is in poll fray so that a check could be maintained on them.

Besides, orders have been issued to transfer within 48 hours officials who have been posted at a particular place for three years, the CEC said, adding the poll panel has summoned records of all police station in-charges and action will be taken against all those found lax.

To a question on BJP's demand for removal of the chief secretary and the DGP of the state, he said the matter is in election commission's knowledge.

In order to check distribution of liquor to voters during elections, the excise department has set up checkposts at the inter-state borders as well as along the border with Nepal, he said, adding the commission has set up a police cell to keep tab on messages received through WhatsApp and social media.

Mr Zaidi said those who reach the polling centre by 5 pm will be allowed to cast their votes even if it meant that the polling parties have to overstay.

Also arrangements will be made to airlift any polling staff who falls ill on duty and ensure his treatment, he said.","lucknow:"

Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal hopes to regain lost ground in the state
Both RLD and BJP are courting Jat voters, hoping to win big in UP
                                About 10 km before you enter Muzzafarnagar town in western Uttar Pradesh, a massive security barricade is manned by many paramilitary personnel in olive green fatigues and holding automatic weapons. In this sugar belt of UP, the extra security deployed by the Election Commission is a reminder of the 2013 clashes between Jats and Muslims that claimed over 60 lives. Months later, the Jats of western UP, once the core support base of Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal, voted en masse for the BJP in a polarised national election of 2014. The BJP took all the seats in the region.

Ajit Singh and his son, Jayant Chaudhary, are trying to regain lost ground in what is seen as their fight to stay relevant when the region votes on Saturday in the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. In 2012, Ajit Singh's party had won all its nine seats in western UP, the number shrinking in comparison to earlier elections.

The RLD's pitch this time is simple. It says the BJP has not kept the promises it made to the Jats in 2014 - its government at the Centre has not given them reservation in government jobs, the hike in procurement prices for sugarcane farmers isn't substantial and it has done little to ensure that sugar mill owners pay arrears to farmers.

""Lok Dal people are straightforward and not like others who lie,"" Jayant Chaudhary told a gathering of RLD supporters and urged them to take his message to every village in the area. ""The RLD is the only party that can bridge the divide between communities,"" he added as he wrapped up and flew away in a helicopter for his next public meeting in Mathura.

Mr Parsekar was appointed Goa's Chief Minister after Manohar Parrikar was elevated to the Union Cabinet as Defence Minister in 2014. However, Mr Parrikar could make a comeback in state politics after BJP's national president said that the new Goa government would work under the leadership of Mr Parrikar, should the BJP retain power in the state.

"139","Uttarakhand Elections 2017: Parties Try To Work Out The 'Fauji Factor'","                             Uttarakhand, which goes to vote for its 70 Assembly seats in just two weeks, produces the highest number of Indian army officers per capita of the population. Nearly 30 per cent of the electorate comprises servicemen, ex-servicemen and their families. In the upcoming state elections, thus political parties are trying their best to woo the 'fauji' vote-bank.

BJP legislator from Mussoorie Ganesh Joshi, who was accused of assaulting police horse 'Shaktiman' during protest and arrested after a national outrage over the incident, claims over 6,000 ex-servicemen are supporting him alone. Canvassing in Kandli village, Mr Joshi said, ""You can see it for yourself. I asked them (ex-servicemen) how much did you get after the government announced OROP (One Rank One Pension) and they said that after sixty years if there is anyone who has fulfilled our promise, it is the BJP.""

""Never before had surgical strikes happened in this way; it sends a message that the BJP government is both willing and ready to do something for its people"", said Bhawani Singh, an ex-servicemen campaigning for Mr Joshi.

""This (BJP) government has made everything digital. Not only have they increased the pension, one can also access it more easily now,"" added Hari Kang, another second generation retired soldier from the same regiment.

In neighbouring Nangnath village however, families of the faujis seemed more taken in by the Congress candidate Godawari Thapli, who enjoys the support of the Gurkha which community has an electoral base of 12 lakh and harbour a formidable reputation in the army.

""We are fauji families whose sons are still serving in the army. As of now we are with the Congress. Let's see what happens ahead,"" adds 28-year-old Anjana.

The Congress has condemned the BJP for making OROP and the surgical strikes a political issue. ""It is sad and unfortunate that the BJP has for the first time politicized our armed forces,"" said state Congress committee chief Kishor Upadhyay to NDTV. The irony however is that Chief Minister Harish Rawat himself recently declared a proposal for the opening of a ministry for soldiers and ex-servicemen by March 2017 if elected to power.

""I don't believe the promises that either government makes,"" says an irate Brig. KG Behl, former president of the Uttarakhand Ex-Servicemen League. ""Despite the fact that we constitute about 30 per cent of the state, our people are still very divided. There was once even a proposal of forming a different political a party for soldiers but it fizzled out,"" said the retired Brigadier.

""I feel that by and large people will be attracted to the amount of OROP and surgical strikes but it will be limited to ex-servicemen in urban areas. In rural areas, where people still don't know about the importance of OROP because they don't have TVs, the pattern of voting will be different,"" said Col. PL Prashar, also from the UESL.","dehradun:"
"140","Punjab Records 70% Turnout, Voting Largely Peaceful","                             Around 70 per cent of voters in Punjab turned up to vote today till 5 pm for the state's assembly elections. The voting largely remained peaceful even after many places reported faulty electronic voting machines or EVMs. Voting remained peaceful, barring stray incidents of minor clashes and arguments.

All those who queued up till 5 pm will be allowed to vote, election officials said from Chandigarh.

Brisk voting was reported in the state's Malwa belt, south of the Sutlej river, with 69 out of the 117 assembly seats and decisive for any party's victory. The Akali Dal, Congress and new entrant Aam Aadmi Party are locked in a bitter contest.

The highest turnout was in Sangrur and Fazilka districts at 73 per cent, followed by Mansa and Fatehgarh Sahib districts at 72 per cent. The Majha (north of river Beas) and Doaba (area between Beas and Sutlej rivers) belts were catching up in voting percentage, election officials said. Amritsar and Ropar districts recorded the lowest turnout at less than 60 per cent till 5 pm.

For the first time, Punjab witnessed three-cornered contests on all seats, between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The enthusiasm of voters was almost equal in rural and urban areas.

Braving the winter chill, thousands of voters turned out in the morning to cast their votes.

Long queues were seen at most polling stations as voting began in all the assembly constituencies from 8 am. Many had reached the poll booths much before the exercise started.

Over 1.98 crore voters would decide the fate of 1,145 candidates, including 81 women and a lone transgender. There are over six lakh first time voters this time.

Voting for the by-election to the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat was also held on Saturday.

Voting at different polling stations in Punjab was disrupted or delayed for periods ranging from five minutes to over an hour on Saturday due to technical snags in electronic voting machines (EVMs).

The Election Department used 31,460 EVMs in the one-day assembly elections. There were 22,614 polling stations in the state.

First-time voters were issued certificates by district authorities in various constituencies.

Among early voters were former Army chief Gen JJ Singh (Patiala city) of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and former Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal (Badal village) of the Congress.

Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, 89, his son and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and daughter-in-law and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal cast their votes in Badal village, which is part of Mr Badal senior's Lambi assembly constituency.

""We will win easily. Punjab is looking forward to peace and development,"" the Chief Minister said after voting.

Mr Badal is being challenged for the Lambi seat by Punjab Congress President and former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and AAP's Jarnail Singh.

Sukhbir Badal is facing a challenge from two sitting MPs - Bhagwant Mann (AAP) and Ravneet Singh Bittu (Congress), for the Jalalabad assembly seat.

Amarinder Singh, accompanied by his wife and former Union Minister of State for External Affairs Preneet Kaur, and other family members, voted in Patiala city.

""I am sure that we (Congress) are winning this election comfortably,"" Mr Singh told media.

Others to cast their votes included cricketer-turned-politician and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu (Amritsar-east), former Olympian and now Congress leader Pargat Singh (Jalandhar Cantt), Sucha Singh Chhotepur (Gurdaspur) of Apna Punjab Party and Congress leaders Sunil Jakhar (Aboha) and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal (Lehra).

Cricketer Harbhajan Singh and Sufi singer Hans Raj Hans voted in polling stations in Jalandhar.

Tight security arrangements were in place across Punjab, with over 100,000 security personnel deployed, and borders with neighbouring states sealed.

The counting of votes will take place on March 11.

In the 2012 assembly elections, 78.57 per cent of voters had exercised their franchise.","chandigarh:"

"143","Punjab Elections 2017: 35 Per Cent Voter Turnout Across State Till 1 PM","                             Brisk polling was going on as around 35 per cent of the total 1.98 crore electors exercised their franchise till 1 PM in the high-stakes Punjab Assembly elections, wherein 1,145 candidates are in the fray.

""35 per cent polling has taken place till 1 PM,"" an election office spokesman said in Chandigarh. ""Polling is going peacefully,"" Additional Director General of Police (ADGP-elections) VK Bhawra said.

Meanwhile, a technical snag was reported in voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines in Majitha and Sangrur, the spokesman said, adding that the matter had been referred to the Election Commission. Voting started around 45 minutes late at two polling booths in Jalandhar and Amritsar due to technical glitches in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).

Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia was unable to cast his vote in the morning due to the technical snag in EVM at polling station number 35, Ward number 5 in Majitha constituency in Amritsar district.

Among those who had cast their vote so far included Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, his wife and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Congress vetran Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.

Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh and his wife Preneet Kaur had also cast their votes.

""Seeking my mother's blessings before casting my vote. Let this be a new dawn for Punjab!"" Amarinder Singh tweeted.

Former Army chief General JJ Singh (retd) of the Akali Dal, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pargat Singh of Congress, Sucha Singh Chhotepur of Apna Punjab Party (APP), and Bhagwant Mann, Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi and Sukhpal Singh Khaira of the Aam Aadmi Party also cast their votes.

Cricketer Harbhajan Singh along with his mother Avtar Kaur also exercised their franchise. The polling for 117 Punjab assembly seats is being held in a single phase amid tight security.

Punjab is witnessing a three-cornered contest between ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance, opposition Congress and new entrant Aam Aadmi Party.

Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has fielded candidates in 94 seats while its ally BJP has nominated candidates in the remaining 23 seats. Congress is contesting alone on all seats. AAP, which is contesting the state polls for the first time, has fielded candidates in 112 seats while its ally Lok Insaf Party, led by Ludhiana-based Bains brothers, has fielded nominees in five seats.

Other political outfits in the fray include BSP, former AAP leader Sucha Singh Chhotepur-led Apna Punjab Party, the Left comprising CPI and CPI-M, and SAD-Amritsar.

Over 200 companies of paramilitary forces have been deputed for the fair conduct of polls.

Voting for Amritsar Lok Sabha seat by-poll is also being held amid tight security arrangements.

The total number of electors in the state is 1,98,79,069, including 93,75,546 females. There are 415 transgender voters.

The total number of candidates in the fray include 81 women and a transgender. The polling commenced at 22,615 polling stations in the entire state.

While 84 Assembly seats are of general category, 34 are reserved.

Speaking to reporters after casting his vote at Lambi, 89-year-old five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said, ""I have 70 years of experience and have fought for Punjab and India. This is a small battle.""

His comment came when asked about the electoral battle turning into a triangular contest this time with the entry of Aam Aadmi Party.

""We will have a bigger win than last time. AAP will finish at third spot,"" Sukhbir Badal claimed. ""People will vote for development, peace and communal harmony. AAP is a pack of criminals,"" he added.

Punjab Congress president and party's chief ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh said his party was leading in the state and was set to form the government. The senior Congress leader, who is contesting from Lambi, said he would defeat Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal in the latter's turf.

""This time three major parties are in the fray. I wish that whoever wins keep Punjab's interests above all,"" cricketer Harbhajan Singh told reporters in his hometown Jalandhar. He also appealed that more and more youth should come out to cast their votes.

General JJ Singh (retd) said SAD-BJP will perform a hat-trick and form the government.

Navjot Singh Sidhu, who along with his wife Navjot Kaur cast his vote, said, ""People of Punjab will give a gift to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi by ensuring party's victory here and its revival in the country.""

""Truth will prevail in Punjab...from this place Congress flag will start floating,"" he said.

The key contestants in the crucial state polls include Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh (Patiala and Lambi seats), Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal (Lambi) and his son Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal (Jalalabad).

The other prominent candidates are Congress veteran and former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal (Lehragagga), Indian Youth Congress chief Raja Amarinder Singh Warring (Gidderbaha), Badal's estranged nephew Manpreet Singh Badal, who is fighting on a Congress ticket from Bathinda Urban, and AAP MP Bhagwant Mann (Jalalabad).

Amritsar Lok Sabha seat fell vacant following the resignation of Amarinder Singh to protest the Supreme Court verdict on Punjab's river waters. The voter strength in this seat is over 14 lakhs.

Prominent among the candidates in fray for the Lok Sabha seat are BJP leader Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, who is up against Congress' Gurjit Singh Aujla and Aam Aadmi Party's Upkar Singh Sandhu.

For the Amritsar Lok Sabha by-poll, 35 per cent polling has taken place so far, an election office spokesman said here.

The counting of votes for the state polls and Amritsar Lok Sabha by-poll will take place on March 11.

Meanwhile, in Moga, the police booked Independent candidate Manjit Singh Mann under the provisions of the Representation of the People's Act and relevant sections of IPC, for allegedly campaigning even after the deadline for the same had ended, Moga's Returning Officer said.

Two ailing women voters, Raj Rani (78) and Bimla Devi (80), came in an ambulance to exercise their right of vote in Phagwara. While one was taken on a stretcher, the other was taken on wheelchair to Booth No 158 near old Dana mandi in Phagwara.

Talking to reporters later, the women said they had arranged for ambulances themselves. They urged the Election Commission to make separate and priority arrangements for the ailing voters.

"144","Varun Gandhi Back On BJP List Of 40 Star Attractions In UP. At Number 39","                             Varun Gandhi, excluded from the BJP's list of ""star campaigners"" in Uttar Pradesh for the first two phases of the assembly elections, is back on the list for the third and fourth phases. So is former state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar whose comments last week about Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and later about Smriti Irani of his own party were slammed as ""sexist.""

Varun Gandhi is number 39 on the list of 40 that every party has to submit to the Election Commission for each phase of elections, and the inclusion is seen as a conciliatory move. Mr Gandhi, 36, does not enjoy a happy equation with BJP chief Amit Shah and has been sulking with the party leadership, which he believes has not backed him after allegations were made last year that he had been honey-trapped and blackmailed into leaking crucial information.

But, said sources, after a rough time with rebellion in the ranks over the BJP fielding a number of people it has recently poached from other parties and from the supporters of another rebellious lawmaker Yogi Adityanath, the party wants no more trouble.

Varun Gandhi is the BJP lawmaker from UP's Sultanpur, which votes only in the fifth phase of the seven-part UP elections, but has considerable influence in pockets of Western UP like Saharanpur and in Pilibhit, his mother's Lok Sabha constituency, which vote in the first two phases.

Mr Gandhi's supporters are bristling at the snub to their leader, at one time talked about as a potential chief ministerial candidate, and the BJP wants to avoid a sabotage attempt when campaigning is at a peak especially in the sensitive western UP which will vote in the first phase on February 11.

The new list of key campaigners is led, like the first, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Veteran leader and the BJP's member of Parliament from Kanpur Murli Manohar Joshi makes a comeback - his omission from the first list along with that of party patriarch LK Advani for the first time ever had raised eyebrows.

Kanpur votes in the third phase. Mr Advani does not feature in this list of star campaigners either.","lucknow:"

"148","Uttarakhand Elections 2017: The Strategy Behind Harish Rawat Filing Nomination From 2 Seats","                             For Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, the last day of nominations brought with it a historic 'first'. After filing his nomination from Kichcha on Tuesday, the Chief Minister on Friday filed his nomination from Haridwar Rural, one of the 11 assembly seats in Haridwar district, where he won the Lok Sabha polls in 2009.

With this, Mr Rawat becomes the first state chief minister to be fielded from two assembly constituencies in Uttarakhand, something he claims, is a strategic imperative.

""These two districts (Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar) are the pillars of our states' development. Out of 70 seats, 20 seats are in these two districts so it is a sizeable share"", the chief minister told NDTV.

The last one week has seen the chief minister travel over 400 kilometres across Uttarakhand where he has been leading the Uttarakhand Swabhimaan Yatra to reclaim the spirit of the state dogged by the political instability of the past two years.

""For the last two and a half years I have had a terrible time. I have had to compromise on many counts,"" said Mr Rawat, who was made chief minister in 2014 after the untimely expulsion of Vijay Bahuguna, his predecessor, over the mishandling of relief operations in the aftermath of the 2013 Kedarnath disaster.

Mr Bahuguna, along with senior leaders like Harak Singh Rawat, Subodh Uniyal and Yashpal Arya, to name a few, form part of a group of leaders that has since defected to the BJP leaving the ruling Congress in disarray. But Mr Rawat doesn't think so.

""After these defectors I feel at least I will be able to perform to my fullest now,"" said Mr Rawat.

Vote-shares and seat distribution are major concerns for the Congress party that currently has only two elected members from the 20 seats in Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar. A large number of these seats were earlier held by the 'turncoat' leaders, 10 of whom have been fielded by the opposition BJP in the forthcoming elections.

Asked if he felt a threat from his own former colleagues, now rivals, Mr Rawat said, ""It is the primary duty of a CM to maintain a majority in the secretariat and I have lived up to that. People often wonder what is Harish Rawat's formula. But if the people of the state feel I should deliver, they should give me a clear mandate. This election is as much about prestige as it is about leadership"", said the 69-year-old chief minister.

According to Mr Rawat, the price of the political instability in the state in former months has been paid by the development process. ""Modiji came to Dehradun. But it seems like he finds it hard to admit our concerns in Delhi. Our proposal to develop an SEZ in the Bhagirathi valley has been stalled by the centre,"" he said.

In the same breath, the chief minister adds, ""I respect and admire Narendra Modi; I am only a small chief minister of a small state. Modiji talks about cooperative federalism, I would like to tell him that we are also part of that team.""

So what is Harish Rawat's immediate vision for the state? ""If elected, I promise a government that is 'bhrashtachar mukt aur rozgar yukt' (corruption free and employment generating),"" he says.

""The Congress has decided to include in its manifesto that by 2020, a job will be given to one member of every family. By 2020 we will also ensure that one woman of every household is linked to a bank in terms of employment. We want to create a model of human development which will make our little hill-state an ideal model,"" Mr Rawat adds.

""People should vote keeping in mind their future but also the challenges we have had to face in the past. There were so many attempts to derail us. Some would even call them sabotage. We have weathered the storms,"" he says.

Uttarakhand goes to polls on February 15 in a contest where both the ruling Congress and the BJP will contest for 70 seats. The test will be crucial for the Congress, which has been in power since 2012 but has yet produced only one chief minister who has lasted a full five year term. The last and only chief minister to have lasted a full five year term was ND Tiwari, a Congress chief minister with a term from 2002 to 2007.","haridwar:"

""According to the party high command, Congress will contest all the 10 seats in Amethi and Raebareli,"" said Congress leader Sanjay Singh, who heads the campaign committee of the party.

Fielding of candidates in Amethi and Raebareli was one of the issues of contention between Congress and Samajwadi Party during their talks to forge the pre-poll alliance.

Mr Singh claimed that Samajwadi Party had assured Congress that it (Congress) will contest on all the 10 seats in these Lok Sabha constituencies of the Congress vice president and the party president, respectively.

""Congress will contest on all the seats and the party is firm on this resolve,"" he stressed.

To a question on BJP fielding his estranged first wife Garima Singh from Amethi, Mr Singh said the party has ""ignored its committed workers and given ticket to a candidate who is neither recognised nor has had any relation with the people of Amethi"".

He went on to add that ""Amethi has only one 'Rani' (queen) who is Amita Singh (his present wife) and had long been preparing ground for contesting from Amethi Assembly seat"".

As per its alliance pact with Samajwadi Party, the Congress will contest 105 out of 403 seats of the UP Assembly.","amethi, uttar pradesh:"

Mr Rana, an accused in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and the party candidate from Thana Bhawan seat in neighbouring Shamli district, had made the remarks at a gathering in his constituency on Saturday, evoking criticism from opposition.

""If I emerge as the winner (in UP polls), curfew will be imposed in Kairana, Deoband and Moradabad,"" he said.

A case was registered against Mr Rana under IPC Section 505 (Making a statement with intent to incite) and Section 125 (Promoting enmity between classes in connection with election) of The Representation of the People Act for his controversial remarks, Thana Bhawan circle officer Sunil Kumar Tyagi said.

The officer said that it was found that the MLA's statement violated the model code of conduct for elections.

Mr Rana today claimed that his remarks were meant for people who have spread terror in the state.

""What I meant was many people have planned to leave western UP fearing the terror spread by goons and robbers. There is no city in that region where people have not planned to move out due to the fear of these goons,"" Mr Rana said.

""...when BJP forms government in UP, these goons who are part of the mafia, whose actions are feared and who forced residents to flee will have to leave the state. The residents of UP won't leave due to fear. The goons will have to leave the state,"" he added.

Hitting out at Mr Rana, SP leader Juhi Singh said, ""What does he want to do by imposing a curfew, he does not seem educated even to know when a curfew is imposed"".

BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi sought to distance from the MLA's remarks saying ""the party is not responsible if a candidate says something"".

""PM Modi and Amit Shah are saying that such statements should not be made. I don't know in what context he (Rana) has said it but I understand that our party is contesting the UP elections on the development plank,"" Ms Joshi said.

Mr Rana has also been booked for allegedly violating the model code of conduct after he held a public gathering and took out a road show at Hathi Karonda village in his constituency in Shamli district yesterday without the permission of the authorities, police said.","muzaffarnagar:"

Mr Khan's statement came on a day when Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav held a joint press conference to launch their campaign for five-phase elections, scheduled for February 11.

""We are not giving (Congress) a clean chit. We are choosing the lesser evil,"" Mr Khan said, referring to the Samajwadi Party's criticism of the Congress on various issues in the past. He also said that this is not a time to discuss such things, which could be answered after the elections.

""There was an experience in Bihar of a mahagathbandhan. That experiment in Bihar succeeded and there was a view among common people that there could be a coalition of like-minded people and they should come together and contest elections,"" the senior leader said to news agency Press Trust of India.

Mr Khan added that the Congress was a prominent force in the Indian independence movement and the Muslim community has had a long association with the party.

The Samajwadi Party leader further said that he does not know what compelled the Congress to form a coalition with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and the ""very agenda of BJP is against the weak, Dalits, backward and minorities"".

"154","BJP Releases Manifesto For Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Highlights","                             BJP President Amit Shah today released the party's manifesto for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections , which will be held in seven phases from February 11. While releasing the manifesto, called 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra' (Pledge for People's Welfare), the BJP president said the party will form the government in Uttar Pradesh with a two-thirds majority. He attacked the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party which have ruled Uttar Pradesh for the last 15 years, accusing them of doing nothing to develop it. The BJP, he said, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would turn UP into a developed state, the way it has other states it rules. The BJP is attempting to return to power in UP after 15 years. In 2012 it had won only 47 of the state's 403 seats, but in the national election of 2014 it swept 71 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats and hopes to extend that performance to this year's assembly election.

Here are the highlights of his speech:The country's biggest state is going to polls.BJP workers have organised public meetings in corners of the state.According to the feedback, BJP is going to form the government with 2/3rd majority.We have tried to understand what people want from the next UP government.We have taken the feedback of about 30 lakh people through missed calls, letters, etc.Prime Minister after his many rallies was sure that people will being BJP in power in UP.SP and BSP have formed governments for 15 years. In that time other states, more backward than UP, have developed.We were sent to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh etc and they are not BIMAARU states anymore.I don't have any qualms in saying that I want to thank the people of UP for giving us 72 of 80 seats. We wouldn't have made a majority govt at the Centre. But it is unfortunate that even with central govt, we can't do much for UP.PM is a parliamentarian from UP. All the schemes are ready but aren't being implemented in UP.Many mafia groups have made life difficult for UP.If a state differentiates on the basis of their vote banks, they can't get justice for all citizens.The election is going to take place after the notes ban. We have faith that the kind of war BJP and PM have launched on black money. UP will show us the results.We have not indulged in politics of caste and religion, we have done the politics of performance.The BJP, after many discussions, have divided the manifesto in 9 parts.The farmer in UP is suffering. The BJP has decided to waive off all farmer loans. The farmers will get further loans with 0 per cent interest.In the next 5 years, a 150 crore fund will be set up for agricultural development.Bundelkhand will get special preference.We will follow the motto of Na Goondaraj Na Bhrashtachar.

Exuding confidence of a ""Congress sweep"" in the polls, Mr Singh negated any threat from either the AAP or the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), saying he did not see them securing ""more than 25 and 12 seats respectively"".

""The Congress would win the remaining seats hands down,"" he said, adding that the party would emerge victorious from all the four seats in Moga district, while the SAD would ""trail heavily"" even in their strongholds of Lambi and Jalalabad -- the seats of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal respectively.

Mr Singh alleged that Mr Sukhbir's own constituency of Jalalabad was in a ""big mess"" due to ""no development"" since the deputy chief minister had been ""busy all these years looting the state"".

He came down heavily on Parkash Singh Badal for the ""growing religious intolerance and incidents of sacrilege"" in Punjab, promising to put him behind bars after getting all the cases of desecration re-investigated.

Mr Singh promised to ""free"" the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) from the ""shackles of the Badals"", who had ""transformed it into their personal fiefdom for political exploitation"" and reiterated his support for anyone standing up against the Badals in the SGPC.

Addressing public rallies in support of Congress candidates Rajwinder Kaur Bhagike and Harchand Kaur from Nihal Singh Wala and Mehal Kalan constituencies respectively, Amarinder claimed that the AAP, ""with its Haryanvi leader and outsider base"", was not in a position to provide stable governance in Punjab, which he said could not afford to experiment with a new dispensation in the midst of the ""ongoing crisis"".

The former Punjab chief minister, gearing up for the last poll battle of his long political career, referred to reports of a large number of ""outsiders"" being brought in by the AAP for its roadshow in Patiala to caution the people against being taken in by Mr Kejriwal's ""false promises"".

The Left leader said BJP desperately wanted to win the upcoming state polls, especially for 2019 Lok Sabha polls, for which ""new problems have been forced on the common man"", while comparing notebandi (demonetisation) with nasbandi (sterilisation).

Sitaram Yechury also blamed RSS and BJP for a series of attacks on Left cadres in Kerala.

Three persons were killed yesterday in the explosion near the venue of the poll campaign of Congress candidate Harminder Singh Jassi at Maur Mandi.

""One more child has succumbed to injuries at CMC hospital in Ludhiana,"" Bathinda Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said today, adding, the victim has been identified as 13-year-old Saurabh Singla.

Earlier, Ripandeep, 9, and Japsimran, 14, died at the CMC hospital where they were admitted. Thirteen injured - three of them critical - are undergoing treatment at different hospitals.

Punjab DGP Suresh Arora along with other senior police officials today inspected the blast site. He said it was an ""unfortunate incident"".

Mr Arora said the Home Ministry has been requested to send experts of NSG to identify the material used in the explosion.

Asked whether the IED was used to carry out the blast, the DGP said one pressure cooker exploded in this incident while another was found at the spot. A forensic team has reached the site to probe the matter, he said.

On ""terror angle"", he said, ""Stating that this (terror) angle is not possible, it will be wrong to say at this moment. We are not ruling this possibility.""

Shivpal Yadav has also vowed to launch his own party after results for the UP assembly elections are announced on March 11.

The Chief Minister's uncle, isolated after Akhilesh Yadav took control of the party ahead of the crucial elections, was in Jaswant Nagar to file his nomination papers. While Akhilesh Yadav gave in to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav's request that Shivpal be fielded by the party, most of his supporters - many strong candidates, he said - have not been fielded.

""They were struck off the list of candidates to make me weak,"" Shivpal Yadav, 61, alleged in an attack on his nephew, who is now party president and is taking all the crucial decisions on the UP elections including sealing an alliance with the Congress.

Akhilesh Yadav's father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, has made it clear that he does not approve of the new partnership but his opinion is moot. Akhilesh Yadav has handed his father, who launched the Samajwadi Party 25 years ago, an advisory role as mentor.

For months before the elections, Shivpal Yadav needled and undermined the Chief Minister and was consistently backed by Mulayam SIngh, who is Shivpal Yadav's older brother.

"169","Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: In BJP's Manifesto, Ram Temple And 'Exodus' In Western UP"," HighlightsAmit Shah releases BJP's manifesto for Uttar Pradesh polls
Says will form inclusive government, no discrimination over caste
Promises Ram temple in Ayodhya, laptops with 1 GB internet for students
                                Promising inclusive development if the BJP is elected, the party's chief Amit Shah on Saturday launched its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections will be held in multiple phases from February 11. Mr Shah also said the BJP was committed to exploring all constitutional options to ensure that the Ram temple is constructed in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya - emphasising that this marks no shift in the party's stand.

But a Hindutva push, subdued for the last few elections as the BJP has pitched development, was seen in it. Mr Shah said there was no contradiction, stating, ""Temple and development can co-exist.""

Among the promises that Mr Shah highlighted was closing down slaughter houses and he said the BJP, if elected, would seek the opinion of the state's Muslim women and then approach the Supreme Court on the issue of the Islamic divorce triple talaq. He also brought up the alleged mass migration of Hindu families from riot-hit towns in western UP that have a Muslim majority, saying the BJP would form teams to ensure to check the exodus of people from their homes because of communal tension and would put the onus on senior government officials to ensure it does not happen.

In its manifesto, the BJP has unveiled a 'zero-poverty plan', promised to waive loans for small farmers, free education and scholarships for the poor and, in what Mr Shah said tops the offer of Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, free laptops with 1 GB free internet for the young.

The BJP's laptops would be given to all regardless of caste or religion unlike the Samajwadi Party's, said Mr Shah, accusing Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's party and also Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party of neglecting UP's development for the last 15 years that they have in turns ruled the state. The BJP, if given a chance to return to power, would bring to UP the kind of development it has to other states it rules, Mr Shah pledged.

""If a state differentiates on the basis of their vote banks, there can't be justice for all citizens. We promise a government that will not discriminate on the basis of caste or creed,"" Mr Shah said in Lucknow, adding, ""Once the BJP comes to power, we work for development of all citizens unlike the SP and the BSP.""

In the 2014 election the BJP had swept 71 of UP's 80 seats. Amit Shah said he had feedback that the BJP would win the state by a two-thirds majority in these assembly elections. He hopes for more than 300 seats, Mr Shah said, adding, ""We have taken the feedback of about 30 lakh people through missed calls, letters, etc. We have done 5,000 public meetings.""

The BSP's Mayawati hit back at the BJP almost immediately saying the BJP has no ""moral right"" to issue another manifesto, when it had ""failed to fulfil any promises made in 2014"".

She also attacked Amit Shah on his remarks on the Ram temple at Ayodhya saying, ""The BJP's national president should know that is it a new thing they are saying that they will construct the Ram Mandir when they come to power here. The matter is in the Supreme Court. Till there is a decision, they can say what they want, the people will never let them do anything wrong here. This is Uttar Pradesh, not Gujarat.""","lucknow:"

""Non-polluting and employment generating industries such as pharmaceuticals, manufacturing of electronic goods and IT sector would be promoted aggressively,"" it added.

""Tourism sector would be given industry status and benefits. Facilities such as changing rooms and toilets to be provided at all tourist locations,"" the party has assured.

Besides promising to encourage different types of tourism with focus on eco, event, medical, heritage, religious, adventure and village tourism, the party has also assured to make the coastal state a preferred destination for mega events such as Defence Expo during the non-peak season.

In a populist assurance, BJP has said that they will provide loan facilities to all agro-based activities at a nominal one per cent interest rate linked to the Krishi card.

""The unauthorised structures on 'communidade' (community) and government lands would be legalised,"" it said.

This comes a day after the Prime Minister campaigned in Punjab's Jalandhar alongwith the state's Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. Prime Minister Modi is expected to highlight the achievements of the BJP-led government in the state over five years and criticise the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party - which has fielded former Inspector General of Prisons Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate. ""The Congress is in a real bad shape. They are being opportunistic,"" the Prime Minister said yesterday in Jalandhar. Earlier during the day, the Prime Minister also addressed NCC officers and cadets at a rally in New Delhi.

Following are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech:The last five years have been an era of development.On this foundation, we want to take the progress forward.In a survey of all small states, they found Goa was the shining star.Infrastructure, social schemes - the Goa government set an example for even the bigger states.I see from Delhi how much work has been done in Goa, I feel very happy about it.For years, Goa has suffered from a disease. This election is to rid Goa of that disease.What is that disease? It is the disease of instability.Political turmoil has hindered Goa's progress.There was a time in Goa's recent history when it saw a dozen chief ministers in 10 years.This slowed down Goa. This instability suited the Congress very well. They managed to shirk accountability.But then people of Goa decided to give five years to a single government. However, even then, for their own benefit they ran away.I appeal to people of Goa to give us a comfortable majority. If you do that I promise you, we will make Goa India's most comfortable state.Today, the Centre is stressing on tourism.People said tourism will dry up - notes ban will affect tourism.Today, they have been silenced.The old government did not understand that to bring tourists from abroad, you have to focus on the international audience. We did that.The government's efforts to encourage tourism benefits Goa the most.This is an industry which can give huge returns even with small investment. The poorest of the poor can earn from it.For 10 years, there was a government at the Centre which had no interest in building any bridges in Goa.This would adversely affect the state's economy. That's why we have focused on infrastructure in Goa.We are building a bridge which will be a convenience for the people and an attraction for the tourists.I can say proudly our government at the Centre has helped Goa more in 25 months than in the last 50 years.This is our speed; this is our direction.Some people don't progress and don't let others progress.","panjim, goa:"

Goa is going to polls on February 4.

PM Modi also made a reference to the objection raised for holding elections in Punjab and Goa on the same day.

Valte was elected from Thanlon assembly constituency. Vice-president of Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) S Achouba also resigned from the primary membership of the party.

Incidentally, the state's move to carve out seven new districts has triggered protests by Manipur's apex Naga organisation United Naga Council (UNC).

Bihar's grand alliance was formed by the efforts of both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad who buried their differences for a bigger objective,"" Mr Tyagi said.

""If we have to win the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then it is necessary that BJP must be defeated in UP polls,"" he said.

Mr Tyagi also said, that had Ajit Singh's party Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and JD(U) been accommodated in the grand alliance, it would have won 300 seats in the UP assembly.

He was accompanied by Water Resources Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, party National General Secretaries RCP Singh, Shyam Rajak, Sanjay Jha and others.

Asked if Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is also JD(U)'s national president, would go to Uttar Pradesh if invited by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for campaigning, Ranjan Singh said ""he (Nitish Kumar) would not go to UP for campaigning"".

""We don't have much stake in UP, so we will pray from here (sitting in Patna) for them to win,"" Mr Singh said.

Mr Tyagi further expressed his disappointment that hard work put in by party workers in preparing grounds for UP assembly polls in five divisions where Nitish Kumar addressed some public meetings could not fructify.","patna:"
"182","Ahead Of Manipur Elections, Senior Congress Leaders Quit The Party","                             As the BJP released its first list of 31 candidates for the upcoming two-phase Manipur assembly elections, scheduled for March 4 and March 8, the ruling Congress suffered a setback after three of its key senior leaders quit the party on Monday.

Incumbent legislators Nemcha Kipgen and Vungzagin Valte tendered their resignation letters to state party chief TN Haokip as well as assembly Speaker Th Lokeshwor. With their resignations, the strength of the Congress in the assembly has reduced to 45.

The vice president of the Congress' Manipur unit S Achouba also resigned from primary membership of the party.

Last year, three senior legislators - N Biren Singh, Y Erabot Singh and Francis Ngajokpa - had quit the Congress and joined the BJP. Sources said that Mr Kipgen, Mr Valte and Mr Achouba might also join the BJP.

The BJP has claimed that several senior ministers would also quit the Congress ahead of the polls.

Mr Kipgen had been elected from the Kangpokpi assembly seat in the last elections whereas Mr Valte was elected from the Thanlon constituency.The Congress has been ruling in the state of Manipur for the last 15 years.

Manipur is facing a crisis after the United Naga Council called for an economic blockade on November 1 to protest against the state government's decision to bifurcate Naga dominated areas and create seven new districts. The economic blockade has affected the key road links to the state, including National Highway-2 and National Highway-37, which in turn has created an acute shortage of essential goods and supplies.","guwahati:"

In Goa, superficially it may look everything is hinky dory but deep inside, these processes are not functioning and the local population is affected.""

""What is important is the delivery of public services. Today, the general complain is that peoples' work is not getting done - whether you to panchayat, municipal bodies or any government office,"" he added.

Mr Gomes, a former Inspector General of Prisons, will contest the election from Cuncolim constituency. He said that the AAP will focus on improving governance as well as removing casinos from the state.

""Improve the governance structure, streamline them, give them necessary training, making them efficient, put good people on the job and see that all your policies start percolating at grassroot level; that is the first priority,"" Mr Gomes said.

Nirvaan Singh is Captain's grandson and runs his social media campaign. He has his task cut out as his grandfather, an old-style politician, takes on the likes of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, famous for its use of social media for election campaigns.

He says Captain's eagerness to learn new skills for canvassing is an advantage and he provides the bridge between the Congress' state chief and the election strategist Prashan Kishore and his team of number-crunching professionals deployed by the party for next week's assembly elections.

""Before putting anything out on social media, we discuss it with Prashant Kishore and his team and the rest he does,"" Nirvan said, referring to his grandfather. Unlike the last election where the social media teams needed laptops, now it's all on smartphones and Nirvaan only needs his iPhone 7.

""I think it's great,"" said Amarinder Singh to NDTV. ""I look at what people are saying till about 1 am, so it is great fun."" Captain, who is leading his party's attempt to wrest Punjab back from the Akali Dal-BJP after 10 years, says he prefers Facebook to Twitter which Nirvaan scopes out for him.

So are the recent Twitter battles that Amrinder Singh has waged with Delhi Chief Minister and AAP boss Arvind Kejriwal all Nirvaan's doing? No, says the grandson, fully crediting his grandfather. ""That was all him. I was reading what his opponents said about him and he said 'sneaky little fellow' and the other stuff, and I said well, you have to put it out there, all that you think,"" Nirvaan said smiling.

The rest, was headlines.

In the latest edition earlier this month, Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted after touring Patiala the constituency that Captain Amrinder Singh is contesting, ""Huge public support. Captain will lose his own election this time."" Captain had shot back, ""If you are so sure, why don't you come and fight me? You sneaky little fellow!""

Nirvan's millennial status is probably his best qualification for this job, more than his History Honours degree from St Stephen's. But its a job that lasts only till March 11, when votes will be counted in five states, including Punjab, where elections will be held in a single phase on February 4.

According to the manifesto, the party has vowed to permanently close all casinos - including floating vessels mounted with gambling dens - in the state as well as free petrol upto five litres per month to every college student.

On the issue of casinos, Goa Congress chief Luizinho Faleiro proposed that the implementation of the ban would take place in phases. Offshore casinos, which are currently in river Mandovi, will be shut down in the first phase whereas onshore casinos would be banned in the second.

""Those on the shore too will be closed at a later stage,"" Mr Falerio added.

When asked if such a move would hamper employment in the state, he said, ""I don't think that there are many Goans working at these casinos.""

The Congress party also promises five litres of free petrol per month to every college student with a valid driving license in the state.

The Congress manifesto also states that the party ""strongly opposes holding defence expo in Goa or give permanent rights to the Defence Ministry to hold the land on lease or on ownership basis anywhere in the state."" It further assures the citizens of a thorough probe into permissions granted the state's Investment Promotion Board for establishing industries in Goa.

He also said a ""false perception"" is being deliberately created during every election that Church has opposed BJP.

""During every election, an impression is created that Church is against us. Church is a religious institution and I would not like to comment on it. But one thing is sure that a few years back, minority brethren were suspicious about BJP and were staying away,"" Mr Parsekar told reporters in Goa.

Interestingly, the Goa Church yesterday expressed its concern over the government's push for cashless transactions, saying the Centre has ""shifted"" from its social policy of uplift of the poor by insisting on the digital transition.

The CM, contesting the February 4 elections from his pocket borough Mandrem, said the minorities have started having a ""positive outlook"" towards BJP.

""In the past, I had a personal experience in my own constituency. Initially, I failed to even open an account in the booths in minority-dominated wards. But it has changed. The situation was different in 2007...I got majority on those booths,"" he said, adding the minorities have started trusting the saffron party.

For total 40 seats going to polls on February 4, the BJP has fielded its candidates on 36 seats and is supporting Independent nominees in two constituencies.

Mr Parsekar said incumbent deputy Chief Minister Francis D'Souza was the first candidate from minority community to accept our candidature and became part of the government.

""After that several leaders from minority accepted our candidature. They were even with us in the government for five years,"" he said.

On the BJP refraining from projecting him as the Chief Ministerial face for the polls, Parsekar said he was never projected as the probable candidate even during the past.

Mr Parsekar replaced Manohar Parrikar as CM after the latter was made Defence Minister.

""I became CM and ran the government for more than two years. I don't want to answer someone's criticism. The election for the post of CM would be held democratically. Let us get the majority after that the elected representatives will decide on the CM candidate,"" he said.

State Congress chief Luizinho Faleiro said that in the first phase, casino boats that float in the Mandovi river would be shut down and in the second, onshore casinos would be targeted. The manifesto was released by former Congress Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in Panaji today.

Mr Faleiro said he did not fear that closing down casinos would affect jobs in the tiny tourist state. ""I don't think that there are many Goans working at these casinos,"" the Congress leader said.

Goa has six casino vessels and about a dozen onshore casinos that operate out of five star resorts. Together they contribute about 200 crore a year to the state revenue.

The Congress has earlier crossed swords with the state's ruling BJP over casinos which has asked why the party did not act against them when it was in power for two terms before the BJP returned.

The BJP had promised to shut down casinos when it was in the opposition and had floated that as a poll promise in 2012. After winning, however, it cited loss of revenue from a ban on mining for not closing casinos, but says that they ""haven't allowed any new casinos to come up and have not renewed any contracts."" All casinos, the BJP says, came up during Congress rule, but has been ambiguous on casinos in this election.

Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which makes its Goa debut, has taken a clear stance in its manifesto stating that it will shut down all casinos and will also provide alternative employment to close to 10,000 people employed by these.

All the parties peg their anti-casino stance on the ""degeneration of Goan culture"" that they allege these promote.

Goa votes on February 4 and after weeks of attempting an alliance with regional party Goa Forward, the Congress has announced that it will contest the assembly elections alone. It said on Saturday that it would contest 37 of the state's 40 seats.

In 2012, Goa threw out the Congress, with the party winning only seven seats. The BJP had won 21 of the 28 seats it had contested, a majority on its own. Then partner, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP had won three seats.

The former PWD Minister, who enjoyed the number two status in the state government, has since fallen from grace of his nephew and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav after a bitter power struggle in the party and the first family.

He has been already axed as the state unit chief and replaced by Akhilesh loyalist Naresh Uttam and been relegated to a virtual nobody in the party.

What is set to add injury to insult is the fact that barring Shivpal Singh Yadav, all other members of the Yadav clan who are in active politics have been named in the list.

Ms Singh is the daughter of Hukum Singh, a seven-time BJP legislator from the Kairana seat and presently its MP.

Her nomination, one of several seats given by the BJP to the children of its leaders, has raised eyebrows given the BJP's biting criticism of the dynastic Politics practised by its rivals.

Ms Singh is a political novice; she lives in Ghaziabad where she runs a school.

But she thinks she has a chance. ""The party may have assessed winnability factor as well,"" she tells NDTV.

Her father admits that his service to the party is one of the reasons why his daughter was selected.

""We never liked family in politics, but we can't deny them the rights also. If a member of the family deserves a political standing, then we shouldn't ignore him,"" said Hukum Singh.

But the Singh family may face an internal battle. The ticket to Mriganka has come at the cost of her own cousin, Anil Chauhan who contested the 2014 by-elections from a BJP ticket in Kairana but had lost with a very close margin.

Mr Chauhan has now joined the rival Rashtriya Lok Dal. He will be fighting against Ms Singh.

Both father and daughter however claim family politics is not the key issue. Law and order is, specifically the hounding out of mostly Hindu families from Kairana.

With these words Mr Singh has revived a controversy he had sparked last year by releasing lists of Hindu families, whom he claimed had left Kairana because of local Muslim criminal gangs. Kairana has a 50 per cent Muslim population.

Later, after the media had poked holes in those claims, Mr Singh said it was not a communal issue merely one of law and order.

He told NDTV on Wednesday that the list may have contained errors, but in election season that doesn't seem to have deterred him from reviving it.

Speaking in Amritsar on the campaign trail, Mr Jaitley, ""I have kept in touch with this city for a very long time not withstanding any election result. I do believe that Amritsar has had a very unfortunate experience over the past 12-and-a-half years of suffering from absentee MPs.""

The reference appeared to be a shot at Mr Sidhu, a three-time lawmaker elected from Amritsar who is often criticised by his opponents of abandoning the city for commercial interests in Mumbai. But countered over the 53-year-old's only recent separation from the BJP, Mr Jaitley said, ""Yes, we share the guilt for that and I'm not referring to only one, I'm referring to at least two who abstained from the city, and the constituency, who also abstained from parliament.""

Despite the 10-year-old regime fuelling anti-incumbency sentiments, Mr Jaitley said, he had three strong reasons to believe why the BJP-Akali combine would return to power. Besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi's continuing appeal and a general appreciation for the state government's performance, the entry of the Aam Aadmi Party would also help them divvying up the opposition to the ruling alliance, he said.

""Conventionally Punjab saw a direct election between Congress and the NDA (BJP-led National Democratic Alliance). This time there is a divided opposition to the NDA. Both the arithmetic and the chemistry will certainly dictate the election result,"" he said.","amritsar:"

The nickname 'Babush' which means baby boy in Portuguese language is shared by two prominent politicians - Deputy Chief Minister Fransic D'Souza and controversial former minister Atanasio Monserratte.

Mr D'Souza is contesting on a BJP ticket from Mapusa constituency and Mr Monserratte is challenging Manohar Parrikar-led BJP in his fiefdom of Panaji constituency.

Mr Monserratte who was expelled from the Congress has formed his own political outfit - United Goans Party.

'Babu', which also means baby boy, is associated with two prominent politicians who are famous more for their nicknames than their real names.

Congress legislator Chandrakant Kavlekar is known as Babu Kavlekar in his constituency. Similarly, former minister Manohar Asgaonkar is also known as Babu or Babu Asgaonkar.

Mr Asgaonkar, a former Congress legislator, had switched party loyalties in the last minute to join the MGP. He is now contesting from Pernem constituency against BJP minister Rajendra Arlekar. The constituency is reserved for Scheduled Castes.

In the remote Sattari taluka, Baba and Khashe are two names which are taken with due respect. 'Baba' is a nickname for Congress legislator Vishwajit Rane contesting from Valpoi constituency while his father and former Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane is referred to as 'Khashe'.

'Khashe' is usually a name for referring to a person who owns large tracts of land in Sattari taluka, located in the North Eastern part of the State.

'Bhau' and 'Bhayi' are two common names uttered in BJP circles. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar is known as 'Bhayi' meaning brother across the state amongst BJP cadres, while Union AYUSH minister Shripad Naik is referred to as 'Bhau' meaning elder brother.

Incidentally, former Congress legislator Pandurang Madkaikar who recently joined the BJP is also known as 'Bhau' in his constituency.

Former State Home Minister Ravi Naik who is contesting on Congress ticket in Ponda constituency is popularly known as 'Patrao', which in Portuguese means 'owner'.

Congress candidate from Canacona Isidore Fernandes is referred to as 'Boss', the nickname which he prominently displays on his vehicles.

Controversial former minister Fransisco Pacheco who is now contesting on Goa Su Raj party ticket from Nuvem constituency is famous as 'Miccky', the nickname which he shares with AAP Panaji candidate Walmiki Naik.","panaji:"
"215","Samajwadi-Congress Alliance In Trouble, Tussle Over Minority-Dominated Seats"," HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav's list of candidates left the Congress upset. 
Akhilesh Yadav is reportedly talking to Congress to sort out differences.
Congress was voted out of power in UP by Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989.
                                The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance which was promising to alter the political equations for assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is in trouble with both sides calling the other's demands for more seats unreasonable.

Amidst building tension, sources in the Samajwadi Party say that all is not over and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is holding talks with Congress leaders through back channels to iron out the differences. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi met sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad at his residence today.

At the heart of the trouble are two key issues - how many seats will each get and which seat will go to which party.

The two parties had sent out all the right signals till Monday last. But when the two camps sat down for seat-sharing talks, trouble erupted. Senior Samajwadi Party leaders today indicated that Akhilesh Yadav, who has already announced 210 candidates - some even on seats held by Congress legislators - may announce more candidates over the next 24 hours, since the time is running out and nominations for the first phase end on January 24.

The chief minister is not waiting for the alliance to be thorough in more ways. Tomorrow, Akhilesh Yadav will release his party's manifesto in Lucknow.

Sensing trouble, top Congress leaders have rushed to Lucknow. The Congress, which has been reduced to player number 4 in Uttar Pradesh, is eyeing the alliance to recover ground. While senior Samajwadi leaders maintain that the Congress does not have the footprint strength to demand nearly 130 seats, the Congress says anything less will hurt the national party's interest. Samajwadi Party sources say the alliance is not taking off as the Congress wants it to surrender some seats it had won in 2012.

However, insiders say that the real tussle is over seats where minority vote holds sway. The Congress was edged out of power in Uttar Pradesh by Akhilesh Yadav's father Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989. The rise of Mullah Mulayam brought the drift of minority vote to the Samajwadi Party from the Congress.

While the Samajwadi Party is keen to maintain its most favoured party status among Muslims, the Congress wants to regain lost ground via the alliance.","lucknow:"

The second list includes family members of many BJP leaders and veterans
Rajnath Singh's son, Pankaj Singh, will contest from Noida constituency
                                New imports and relatives of senior politicians continue to feature among the BJP's candidates for the Uttar Pradesh elections despite heartburn in party ranks and even protests against the party fielding ""outsiders"" earlier this week.

A second list of 155 candidates announced today includes Pankaj Singh, the son of union Home Minster Rajnath Singh and Mriganka Singh, the daughter of party MP from Uttar Pradesh, Hukum Singh. The new list also names Rita Bahuguna Joshi as the candidate from Lucknow Cantt.

Ms Joshi, a former Congress chief from the state, joined the BJP only in October, 2016. Lucknow Cantt is the seat she won in 2012 and this year's contest could pitch her against Aparna Yadav, the second daughter-in-law of Mulayam Singh Yadav, if the Samajwadi Party fields her from the constituency.

Akhilesh Yadav Gets Call","                             Swamy Prasad Maurya, strategically poached by the BJP from Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party only six months ago in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh election, is said to be evaluating another change of party. There is speculation that the politician, who is said to command significant support from some sections of UP's Other Backward Caste or OBC voters, is unhappy with the party's selection of candidates for next month's assembly elections and could join Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party.

Mr Maurya told NDTV that he has been in touch with Akhilesh Yadav and offered fulsome praise for the 43-year-old UP Chief Minister. ""I congratulated him for his victory...He is a young and dynamic leader and a very good human being. We share a very good personal relationship,"" Mr Maurya said, referring to Mr Yadav winning the use of the Samajwadi Party name and symbol in a feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav.

He was equally candid about his problems in the BJP. ""I am struggling to get ticket for supporters from my community who moved from the BSP with me,"" he said, very clear that he is asking for his due share. The former BSP man is said to have demanded 35 of UP's 403 seats for him and his supporters, including a son and a daughter, to contest. The BJP, sources said, is willing to concede no more than five.

The BJP had inducted Mr Maurya last August as it sought to consolidate voters belonging to different sections and communities for the mega UP elections, being pegged as a semi-final before 2019 national election.

Mr Maurya draws his support from the Maurya, Kushwaha, Saini and Shakya communities. He was Leader of Opposition in the UP assembly before he quit the BSP, accusing Ms Mayawati of ""selling assembly ticket to candidates.""

Other parties are said to have approached Mr Maurya too at that time and there was talk of negotiations with the Samajwadi Party. The BJP had won, but as Mr Maurya had joined the party in Delhi he had asked it to treat his supporters well. Some had joined with him and many more would follow, he had promised.","lucknow:"

The villagers are angry with the lotus, the hand, the cycle, the elephant and every other symbol that represents a political party. None, they say, have done any work for them. The sitting MLA here, is from the Bahujan Samaj Party.

One by one, villagers take the microphone, their voices filled with anguish and anger at an electoral process which they feel merely exploits their vote. Their message now - Chandaur will not vote.

Anand Kumar, a young daily wager says for years young men in this village have struggled to get an education. When they do get an education, they don't get jobs. Like Shiv Bodhan, who is in his thirties and has a Masters degree in Arts but is unemployed. ""What's the point of our degrees when to get jobs you need to have money to bribe people? Politicians tell us they will focus on the youth but our ears have tired of listening to these lies,"" Bodhan says, adding, ""We don't have a job, they don't have a vote.""

Malkhan Lal, who works on farms and as labour, thrusts a sheaf of papers at us to show how many court cases are pending here. ""We're from a poor village in Bundelkhand, so no judge, no lawyer is interested in us or our cases. Whether it is about land or about the identification required for ration cards, we have been fighting just to get our basic entitlements. Yet each elections, like mules we would go to vote. No more.""

Years of drought have pushed the people of Chandaur into desperate poverty and helplessness. 70-year-old Gujaratiya says she can't vote for people who don't care whether she lives or dies. ""I have two children who are waiting to be married but who can think of marriage when we go hungry for days."" Every election, Gujaratiya says, she ""would obediently go to vote,"" but now believes that ""This democracy is for rich people not us.""

Village pradhan Ramchandar, who is in his fifties, says it is ironic that Chandaur's election boycott has drawn the attention of local politicians and journalists, but its hardships never did. ""I am with my people on this. All 4,500 of us will not vote in these elections,"" he says.

Unlike other villages, which have announced a boycott of elections and later turned up to vote, Ramchandar says, ""It will not happen here.""

""No alliance at the cost of Congress workers' self-respect,"" said the party's state chief Raj Babbar, refusing to say whether the alliance with the Samajwadi Party is on or not. Mr Babbar was expected to announce the alliance this evening with his Samajwadi Party counterpart Naresh Uttam.

The opposition party said it has not stitched a formal alliance, but has only entered into a seat-sharing pact with Goa Forward, launched a year ago, and others for the February 4 elections.

""This is not an alliance. This is purely a seat-sharing agreement that we are having based on winnability of candidates,"" All India Congress Committee General Secretary Digvijay Singh told PTI.

Seeking the relief, he stated that Ojaswi Party, of which he is one of the founders, wants to field candidates in the elections and that he needs to be out of jail to oversee the preparations.

The court kept the matter for hearing on January 21. Sai was arrested for allegedly raping a Surat-based woman disciple of his father between 2002 and 2005. Seven persons, including Sai and his aides were charged under sections of Indian Penal Code for rape, unnatural sex, molestation, wrongful confinement, unlawful assembly, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy.

The woman had accused Sai of repeated sexual assault when she was living at Asaram's ashram in Surat.

The victim's elder sister had also made similar allegation against Sai's father Asaram while she was living at an ashram on the outskirts of Ahmedabad between 1997 and 2006.

The two sisters had lodged separate complaints against Sai and Asaram for allegedly raping them.

He was arrested near the Delhi-Haryana border in December 2013 after evading law for two months following registration of the case against him.

The leaders are trying to get tickets for their children even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had exhorted people of the poll-bound states to shun dynastic politics and vote for development.

Interestingly, state Congress chief Kishore Upadhyay, who has a key role in the distribution of party tickets, faces a big test as he himself has been advocating to keep away from from dynastic politics.

The list of those lining up for tickets for their family, mostly sons or daughters, is huge.

Mr Rawat wants to field his two sons, Virendra and Anand, daughter Anupama and his wife Renuka, in this state elections.

According to sources from Congress, Virendra and Anand will be trying their luck from assembly segments in Kumaon region while Anupama and her mother could contest from Haridwar district, a Garhwal division of the state.

Going by the reports, Mr Rawat himself might contest from two assembly seats.

His other relatives, Karan Mehra, Rajya Sabha MP Mahendra Singh Mehra are also aspiring for party tickets.

Apart from them, Mr Rawat's loyalists, including Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal, former MLA from Sult Ranjit Singh Rawat, Lalit Farsvaan from Kapkot, Harish Dhami from Dharchula and Almonda's Manoj Tiwari are vying for ticket to be party's candidate.

State finance minister Indira Hridayesh and Irrigation minister Yashpal Arya also want to field their sons in the elections.

BJP, which claims it is against dynastic politics, is eyeing on Ritu Bhushan, daughter of former chief minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri, to contest from Karnaprayag. Vijay Bahuguna apparently have also asked ticket for his son Saket or Sourav to take on the electoral battle from Sitarganj seat.

BJP's Satpal Maharaj has projected himself from Chaubattakhal while his wife and former forest minister Amrita Rawat has sought ticket from Ramnagar assembly seat.","dehradun:"
"244","'Will Contest Election,' Says Shivpal Yadav, Isolated After Nephew Akhilesh Yadav's Big Win"," HighlightsMr Yadav's name added to list sent by brother Mulayam to nephew Akhilesh
Meeting being held at Akhilesh Yadav's office to finalise SP candidates
SP will contest UP election in partnership with Congress
                                Shivpal Yadav, recently deposed as the Samajwadi Party's Uttar Pradesh chief in a bitter power tussle with his nephew and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, has said he will contest next month's assembly elections in the state.

""I will fight the elections,"" Shivpal Yadav told NDTV this morning. The 61-year-old politician's name was added last night to a list of 38 candidates sent by older brother Mulayam Singh to Akhilesh Yadav, who has been recognised by the Election Commission as the Samajwadi Party's chief and has been allotted use of its cycle symbol.

A meeting is being held today at Akhilesh Yadav's 5 Kalidas Marg office in Lucknow to finalise the Samajwadi Party's candidates for UP. It will contest the election in partnership with the Congress, and has offered a little over a 100 of UP's 403 seats for the ally and any others who join them.

Akhilesh Yadav's party will contest about 300 seats and, sources said, the Chief Minister is expected to accommodate all the 38 people recommended by his father; many of the names, they said, overlap with the son's nominees for those seats.

For months, Shivpal Yadav undermined and challenged the Chief Minister's decisions in a family feud that saw Mulayam Singh consistently back his brother against son Akhilesh. ","lucknow:"
"247","90 Punjabis To Fly To India From Canada To Campaign For AAP","                             Some 90 Punjabis of Indian-origin from Canada will fly to Punjab to campaign for Aam Admi Party (AAP) in 16 of the state's largest constituencies for the assembly elections on February 4.

They will arrive in Punjab on January 19. ""I want to be a part of real change,"" Surinder Mavi, a 31-year-old Brampton resident who helped in organising the plane load of AAP ""election volunteers"" was quoted as saying by Toronto Star.

Mr Mavi said the Toronto area volunteers were part of a campaign that will see thousands of Indian expatriates arrive in Delhi in Punjab to help AAP in the elections, it reported.

Mr Mavi's political awakening began with his arrival in Canada eight years ago, when he realised bribes were unnecessary and basic rules, like stopping at red lights, were respected.

For the election, Mr Mavi will ride an AAP campaign bus that will rally support in 16 of Punjab's largest constituencies.

He had joined the Canadian branch of AAP, which had burst onto the Indian political scene two years ago with a platform of ending the culture of ""bribe-taking,"" the daily reported.

The key platform issues in campaign will be AAP's proposals to fight widespread drug abuse among the youth and programmes to give farmers more money for their crops.

Azad Kaushik, Canadian president of the Overseas Friends of BJP, admitted to ""an anti-incumbency factor"" in Punjab. But he told the Star over phone from Delhi, where he was visiting, that the BJP's economic record would keep its coalition with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in power in Punjab.

Mr Kaushik also accused AAP of having ""failed miserably"" in Delhi, which it governs. ""Polls in the last several months have indicated widely different results. But all show the AAP having a significant impact (in Punjab),"" it reported.

The Punjab election is likely to witness a three-way fight between SAD-BJP, Congress and AAP in all 117 seats.","toronto:"
"251","Arvind Kejriwal To Launch 'Ghar Bachao Muhim' Campaign In Punjab","                             AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal will be on a two-day visit to the Majha region of Punjab starting January 14 during which he will launch the 'Ghar Bachao Muhim' campaign in the run-up to the upcoming state Assembly polls.

Stating this in Amritsar today, AAP Punjab legal wing head and party candidate from Majitha Himmat Singh Shergill said the Delhi Chief Minister will launch the campaign to encourage the people of Majha to stand united against the ""corrupt"" politicians who ""ruined"" numerous young lives by ""patronising the drug trade"" in the state.

Mr Shergill, who was accompanied by AAP candidate from Amritsar (South) Inderbir Singh Nijjer, said Kejriwal will be in the region from January 14 to 15 during which he will tour the villages of Bhoa, Dinanagar, Dera Baba Nanak, Ajnala, Rajasansi, Attari, Tarn Taran and Khemkaran constituencies falling in the border zone.

He will give a clarion call to the people to fight a ""decisive"" battle against the ""crooked"" politicians for their legitimate rights and betterment of future generations.

Mr Shergill said it was pathetic that Punjabis, who immensely contributed to the national food basket, despite their small geographical area, formed the majority in the army and brought laurels in education and sports, were feeling ""depressed and deserted"" by these ""so-called leaders"" who were busy ""filling their coffers at the cost of Punjab's future"".

Mr Nijjer said Punjabis have always been on the forefront in defending the nation and were acclaimed throughout the world for their exemplary courage, honesty and hard work, but the ""wicked"" politicians have ""wreaked havoc"" on the younger generation by ""exposing them to lethal drugs"".

He asserted that AAP had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" towards drugs and corruption and that those involved in these will be dealt with sternly if the party came to power in Punjab.","amritsar:"
"252","Akhilesh Yadav Has Forged A New Force In Indian Politics",NA,"taking a longer view of developments in the samajwadi party, it can safely be said that it is immaterial who wins the ""cycle race"", that is, which faction is allotted the bicycle symbol. in fact, so convoluted is the scenario that it is not even certain that there are two clear factions, and it is equally uncertain if the party will split at all. matters took a comic turn last monday when the contending groups led by father and son respectively approached the election commission with reams of documents to prove their majority within the party and thereby claim their right to the symbol. but by late evening, it was clear that the patriarch, mulayam singh yadav, was keen to pull back from the brink and even the so far belligerent son, up chief minister akhilesh yadav, was not averse to yet another formula to broker peace. ""the samajwadi party stands united"" muttered mulayam singh while declaring that akhilesh yadav would remain the party's electoral face and chief ministerial candidate. so many u-turns have been made in the last one month that nothing can be concluded with finality.

but one thing is certain: the sp has already split within, even if it pretends to stay united for public consumption for the time being. it is often assumed that the sp parivaar is basically a drama within the extended mulayam singh family, that rival contenders are trying to push one another out in order to take full control over the organization on the eve of the assembly elections scheduled to be held within the next couple of months. the informal split which has already happened is discernibly one between two generations, with patriarch mulayam singh leading the elder and more established leaders (mostly his own relatives), while akhilesh heads the younger group comprising mostly non-family leaders.

for observers of indian politics, this is a fascinating scenario. what is playing out is a dramatic generational transition in india's biggest once-mandalite party. although mulayam singh, along with lalu prasad in bihar, was among the biggest beneficiaries of mandalism in indian politics and also an architect of the electorally invincible m-y (muslim-yadav) formula, time has taken a toll on their grasp of hindi heartland politics. the m-y alliance helped to thwart the challenge of bjp's mobilization in the name of the ram mandir in ayodhya. despite the euphoria which brought kalyan singh to power in 1991, he could not repeat that performance for the bjp post demolition of the babri masjid, and mulayam was back in the saddle.

since the 1990s, up's politics has remained clearly delineated. over time, the congress steadily eroded as a mass party, while mayawati's fledging bsp with its core dalit support base emerged as a serious contender for power, initially in alliance with the bjp, but eventually on its own steam. through this, mulayam singh's m-y base was largely undiminished. however the ageing patriarch failed to read the aspirational urges of his own yadav and remaining obc communities. maybe finally recognising the need to make a generational switch, he fielded his son akhilesh as the party's chief ministerial face in 2012 and the energetic new generation leader surprised pundits by leading the sp to a spectacular victory, winning 229 seats in the 405-member up assembly in that election.

akhliesh yadav dramatically altered his father's style of politics, focusing almost entirely on up's economic development aimed at consolidating a youth support base that largely cut across caste and community lines. after five years, people in up recall world-class highways (such as the 393-km-long agra-lucknow expressway built in a record time of 22 months), the recently launched lucknow-ballia expressway, and the lucknow metro as the dominant symbols of akhilesh's rule. there is hardly anything by way of infrastructure built by his predecessors that can compare with the breakneck speed with which akhilesh went about modernizing up. this was accompanied by a plethora of social sector schemes targeting women and farmers. while such social schemes often flounder on delivery and lead to corruption too, so far the up government has managed to implement them with a fair measure of success. the noticeable aspect of akhilesh's record in office is that no appeal has been made on caste and community lines: he has played primarily on the aspirational urges of the youth, particularly the newly empowered yadav and obc youth.

this approach has brought him into conflict with the older generation yadav leadership in his own party, particularly his uncle shivpal, who is alleged to operate through a network of local strongmen. akhilesh may have thus failed to get on top of up's law and order situation, but few doubt his sincerity to eventually combat such elements.

thus the division within the samajwdi party is not just generational, it is also aspirational. in this the young samajwadi leader is fighting not only against his own family, most of which is tied to traditional clan-based politics, but is also contesting against the appeal of prime minister narendra modi whose policies attract the youth across caste and class.

in many senses, therefore, akhilesh yadav is the first mature post-mandal leader in contemporary politics. clearly the politics of pure mandalism has run its course - for the empowerment of the obcs is now an irreversible reality. akhilesh is working to construct a post-mandal base for himself and his party and may well become the example for other similar outfits in north india.

with or without the bicycle symbol and irrespective of whether he leads a united sp to the hustings, akhilesh yadav has emerged as up's pre-eminent next generation politician. even if he fails to repeat his winning feat of 2012 in the forthcoming assembly poll, the constituency he is carving out for himself is there to stay. mayawati's dalit-dominated party is unlikely to ever gain cross-caste acceptability, although a section of muslims may vote for her as a tactical ploy to defeat the bjp. in fact, it can be said with some certainty that a paradigm shift has come over up politics and development has pushed identity politics to the back-burner, even if it takes decades to extinguish it altogether.

and that paradigm shift heralded by akhilesh yadav is spelling the doom for backroom cloak-and-dagger politics at which mulayam singh's associates excel. politicians are a canny lot at the worst of times, and so the overwhelming support garnered by akhilesh within his own party, to the chagrin of leaders like shivpal singh, clearly shows which way the wind is blowing. split or no split, the samajwadi party is akhilesh's for the taking.

The one-on-one meeting came after Mulayam Singh Yadav seemed to initiate a reconciliation by saying last evening that Akhilesh would be Chief Minister again if the Samajwadi Party wins the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, to be held in multiple phases starting February 11.

The deal-breaker is the position of party president, usurped from his father by Akhilesh Yadav at a party meeting on January 1. Mulayam Singh Yadav asserts he is still party president and wants Akhilesh to give up his claim. Akhilesh, who is backed by a majority leaders and lawmakers in the party, is adamant that he will hold the post for three months and will relinquish it once the UP elections are finished.

Bihar politician Lalu Yadav confirmed that Akhilesh had told him as much when they talked on phone last evening.

The 43-year-old Chief Minister deeply mistrusts his father's closest aides, Mulayam Singh's younger brother Shivpal Yadav and Amar Singh, and wants them kept away from crucial decision-making in this period. His demands - that Shivpal Yadav be removed as the party's UP chief and Amar Singh be sacked - have not been agreed to by Mulayam Singh.","lucknow:"

Akhilesh Yadav yesterday won rights to use party name, symbol
                                Akhilesh Yadav, having set aside his family drama, is moving on to the next order of business ahead of the election: stapling together the alliance that he believes will help him counter rivals Mayawati and the BJP in Uttar Pradesh which begins voting next month. A deal with the Congress will be announced ""in a day or two,"" he told NDTV today. The Congress pre-empted him, declaring the collaboration at a press conference in Delhi today, though it said the details are being finalized. Key among those: how many of the state's 403 seats will be allotted to the Congress and to another potential partner, Ajit Singh's RLD.

Mr Yadav, 43, wants another term as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, but has been preoccupied with a confrontation with his father, Mulayam Singh, whose power play included declaring candidates for the election without inputs from his son.

Yesterday, the issue of who is boss was decided by the Election Commission which ruled that Akhilesh Yadav has the backing of most of the Samajwadi Party and is therefore in control of the legit version of the outfit and not a spin-off as his father had alleged. The victory entitles the young politician to the use of the party symbol of the cycle, easily recognized by voters. Determined to maintain his line of maximum respect for his father, Mr Yadav went to visit him as soon as the case was decided in his favour and then tweeted a photo of them together.

He confirmed today that he is closing a deal with the Congress, which could expand to include smaller regional parties like Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal or RLD. Rahul Gandhi, who is the Vice President of the Congress, has an established political bromance with Akhilesh Yadav. Recently, they flexed their amity if not their vocabulary, with Mr Gandhi terming Mr Yadav ""a good boy"" who shot off the same phrase in return.

There are at least 20 seats where strong ticket contenders have been disappointed giving rise to the possibility that some of them may enter the fray as independents or work to spoil the prospects of the party's official nominees.

While most of the disappointed contenders are yet to disclose their cards, they make no bones about their feeling of being left out.

With Congress turncoat Subodh Uniyal fielded from Narendranagar, BJP's very own Om Gopal Rawat, a former MLA who had consistently nursed the constituency has announced his intention to contest as an independent from the seat.

There is discontent among party leaders in almost all seats from where Congress rebels have been fielded. Former legislator Asha Nautiyal who was expecting a ticket from Kedarnath is unhappy with Congress turncoat Shailarani Rawat fielded from the seat.

Similarly, former MLA Shailendra Singh Rawat is disappointed over Harak Singh Rawat being fielded from Kotdwar.

Former MLA Suresh Chand Jain is sulking in Roorkee from where Pradip Batra has been declared the party's official nominee.

Jain said he feels cheated and will certainly contest for development of the town.

Some of the party's sitting MLAs have also been denied tickets including Yamkeshwar MLA Vijaya Barthwal and Chaubatakhal MLA and former Pradesh BJP president Tirath Singh Rawat.

While Barthwal has been denied a ticket to field former CM and Pauri MP BC Khanduri's daughter Ritu Khanduri, Tirath was ignored to make room for Congress turncoat Amrita Rawat's husband Satpal Maharaj.

Resentment among BJP leaders ahead of assembly polls doesn't augur well for the party with Congress in a mood to lap up disgruntled BJP elements and field them against erstwhile party rebels.","dehradun:"

""A man identified as Gurbachan Singh, a relative of a Sikh radical leader, threw a shoe at Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal,"" Muktsar Senior Superintendent of Police Dhruman H Nimbale said. There was no injury to Mr Badal in this incident, he added.

Gurbachan Singh is the brother of radical Sikh leader Amrik Singh Ajnala.

""He appeared to be upset over the sacrilege incidents which took place in Punjab,"" the Senior Superintendent of Police said, adding that he had been arrested.

A case will be registered against the accused, he said.

The party has filed a complaint with the Chief Electoral Officer of Uttar Pradesh, where elections will take place next month, against the Congress leader. The BJP has also sought the withdrawal of the Congress' election symbol 'hand' and also cancellation of its recognition as a national party.

""Rahul Gandhi, at a convention, named as 'Jan Vedna Sammelan' in Delhi on January 11, 2017, made religious comments by co-relating the symbol of Indian National Congress with religious gods such as Shivji, Guru Nanak, Buddha, Mahavir and Islam, violating the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, MCC and the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court,"" the BJP wrote in its complaint on Friday.

Mr Gandhi had said: ""I found Congress symbol in Shivji, Guru Nanak, Buddha, Mahavir's pictures. I asked Karan Singhji what does it mean? He said (it means) 'don't get afraid.'""

""It's a blatant violation of the model code of conduct and strict action should be taken against Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party for trying to influence voters not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in other poll-bound states, ""said senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav.

Demanding the cancellation of the Congress' recognition as a national party, the BJP letter said, ""The Congress party has not disassociated itself from the statements of Shri Rahul Gandhi. Therefore, it has also further violated the Model Code of Conduct.""

The by-polls were watched closely as a bellwether for assembly elections next year.

In Bandhavgarh, the BJP's Shivnarayan Singh defeated the Congress candidate Savitri Singh by more than 25,476 votes. By-elections were held because the sitting BJP legislator was elected to parliament in a by-poll last year.

The by-poll in Ater has been won by the Congress' Hemant Katare, whose father Satyadev Katare was the Congress' legislator from the seat and had died recently. The party had fielded the MLA's son hoping to cash in on a sympathy wave, but Mr Katare almost didn't make it, trailing behind the BJP's Arvind Singh Bhadoria in the first few rounds and finally winning only by 857 votes.

The Congress had demanded that voting in the Madhya Pradesh by-elections be done on ballot paper and not electronic voting machines or EVMs, after a voting machine reportedly issued only BJP slips during a demonstration in Bhind, where the Ater constituency is. The Election Commission has emphatically said that EVMs cannot be rigged, rejecting the demand for paper ballot.

The last-minute win in Madhya Pradesh improved the Congress' tally from today's by-elections. For most of the day it had seemed set to retain only two seats in Karnataka. The party has lost state after state in assembly elections since its debacle in the 2014 national elections and hopes to benefit from a possible anti-incumbency sentiment in next year's election in Madhya Pradesh, which has been ruled by the BJP for many years.

The BJP has ruled the state since 2003, with Chief Minister Chouhan following up a big win in the 2013 assembly elections with almost a clean sweep of the state in the 2014 national election. The BJP had won 27 of 29 Lok Sabha seats.

She said Mr Rawat himself losing both the seats he had contested was a ""dark chapter of politics"".

Apparently hurt by Ms Hridayesh's outburst, Mr Rawat issued a statement through his former media advisor Surendra Kumar, and said that he had already publicly owned up responsibility for the the Congress's defeat and he is ready to offer himself if party leaders feel he deserves some punishment.

""I have already owned up responsibility for the party's defeat publicly immediately after the polls. Still, if PCC president Kishore Upadhyay and the Leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh want to subject me to some punishment, I readily offer myself,"" Rawat said in the statement.

The Congress was decimated in the recent assembly elections in Uttarakhand as well as the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. In Uttarakhand, the party won 11 out of the total 70 constituencies.","dehradun:"

Mr Patel was recently on a four-day visit to Gujarat and mainly stayed in his hometown Bharuch, where the leader of opposition Shankarsinh Vaghela and party's state unit chief Bharatsinh Solanki, who are currently in the race to become Congress' Chief Minister candidate for the state assembly elections, met him separately.

Several legislators, including Paresh Dhanani, also met Mr Patel to present their side.

Ahead of Mr Patel's visit, a meeting was held on April 17 at Mr Vaghela's residence in Gandhinagar, which was attended by 36 MLAs (out of the total 54 MLAs in the state assembly). Gujarat Congress in-charge Gurudas Kamat was also present there.

During that meeting, the legislators demanded that Mr Vaghela should be made the Chief Minister candidate. They said in case the party decides not to declare a Chief Minister face in the state, Vaghela should be given a ""free hand"" for the elections and he should be made the poll committee in-charge.

Ahmed Patel visited Gujarat a day after the MLAs' meeting at Mr Vaghela's place. According to party sources, some of the legislators, who chose not to attend the previous meeting, met Mr Patel under the leadership of Amreli legislator Paresh Dhanani and opposed making Mr Vaghela as the party's Chief Minister face or the election committee in-charge of the state.

""While Solanki met Patel in Bharuch on Thursday and gave a detailed representation from his side, Vaghela met him yesterday and discussed about the political situation related to the upcoming elections,"" sources added.

Mr Patel told them that a final decision on whether to declare a Chief Minister candidate in Gujarat or not rests with the party high command. Mr Patel left Gujarat yesterday.

State party spokesperson Manish Doshi said, ""Patel is a senior leader of Congress and it is natural for the state leaders to visit him if he is in Gujarat. There is nothing unusual in it,"" he said.

According to Mr Doshi, the discussion between party's state unit president and Patel included a range of issues like political situation in the state and upcoming visit of national vice-president Rahul Gandhi on May 1.

Meanwhile, Gurudas Kamat had yesterday tweeted, ""Met Rahulji (Gandhi) and had a detailed discussion with him over his upcoming rally in Gujarat on May 1 to address a tribal rally.""

Mr Doshi said that the Congress vice president will address a rally at Dediyapada in Bharuch district on May 1.","ahmedabad:"
"277","Will Start Campaign To Unite 'Samajwadis': Shivpal Singh Yadav","                             In a new twist to the feud within the Samajwadi Party, its leader Shivpal Singh Yadav today said he will soon launch a campaign to unite ""samajwadis"" (socialists) to bring them on one platform.

Shivpal, the warring uncle of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, had threatened to launch a new party after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

""We will not let the legacy of 'samajwad' (socialism) to weaken and will soon launch a campaign to unite socialists to bring them on one platform,"" he said here while felicitating Sayed Sagir Ahmad, a senior socialist leader.

""The fight for social justice will be fought with full strength. In the name of Rama, politics of social justice should be done and not of hatred,"" Shivpal said.

After filing his nomination for state polls on January, he had said he would form a new party after the election results are declared. But, subsequently he had said there was no such move.

With Akhilesh snubbing Shivpal and naming Ram Govid Chowdhury the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly and Mulayam Singh Yadav giving the Samajwadi Party's national executive meeting a miss, any patch-up seems unlikely.

In a public outburst against his son, Mulayam on Saturday had said Akhilesh had insulted him and the voters understood that ""one who is not loyal to his father, cannot be loyal to anyone"" which led to the party's poll debacle.

The SP got only 47 seats in the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly, its lowest tally since the party's inception in 1992.

Following a bitter feud between the father and the son, Akhilesh had snatched reins of the party from Mulayam Singh and their fight also reached the Election Commission.

Mulayam, who has since been given the role of party mentor, had openly criticised the Samajwadi-Congress alliance and was virtually absent from the campaign too.","lucknow:"
"281","EVM In Madhya Pradesh Votes Just For BJP, Says Opposition Seeking Probe"," HighlightsEVM allegedly produces slips for BJP no matter which button pressed 
Local election officer rejects charges, poll commission seeks report
Opposition brings back allegations of EVM tampering in last elections
                                An Electronic Voting Machine that was reported to have voted for a particular party during a demonstration in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday reignited the opposition charge that tampered EVMs had helped the BJP in the last round of assembly elections.

The Election Commission of India has sought a detailed report from Bhind's District Election Officer after seeing the video of a demonstration organised by state election officials for journalists ahead of by-elections in the state's two assembly seats. It has also sent a high-level team to the state to investigate.

Chief Electoral Officer Shalina Singh later told reporters that they wanted to show how the VVPAT - Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail - would let voters know if the machine voted for the different candidate than the one selected by the candidate. She also rejected claims that the machine voted for the BJP on both occasions.

But the opposition that has been raising questions on the EVMs weren't clearly satisfied.

VVPAT is a machine which dispenses a slip with the party's symbol for which a person has voted for. The slip is visible for seven seconds before it drops in a box.

The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party rushed to the Election Commission's in Delhi, tasking the party's senior leaders to reiterate their concerns with the poll panel that has, in the past, dismissed questions about the neutrality of the machine.

BSP chief Mayawati was the first to question the EVMs after the BJP's massive win in the assembly elections that installed Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. Other opposition parties soon joined in, right from AAP's Arvind Kejriwal who had hoped to come to power in Punjab and the Samajwadi Party that was reduced to double digits in the country's most populous state to the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.

Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said the doubts raised on the EVMs must be investigated. Mr Scindia, who along with party general secretary Digvijaya Singh had approached the panel, said the EC had assured they would take steps.

The Congress general secretary said EVMs should not be used for elections. ""From Advani to Mayawati to Kejriwal, I stand with them on this,"" Mr Singh, otherwise a bitter critic of Mr Kejriwal, said. BJP veteran LK Advani had raised doubts about the possibility of EVMs malfunctioning after the 2009 elections.

Mr Kejriwal too landed at the commission soon after. The Madhya Pradesh example, where the machine allegedly voted for the BJP irrespective of the candidate selected, was another such example where machines only voted for one party. ""If it was because of a fault, why is it that the faulty machines only vote for BJP... why not the Congress or the Samajwadi Party,"" he asked.","bhopal:"

Addressing the party workers, BSP zonal coordinator Raj Singh said on one hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks about eradication of corruption but on the other, his party acquired absolute majority by ""killing the democracy"" and ""manipulation of EVMs"".

He said BSP president Mayawati had raised the matter soon after the election results and now all other parties were of the same opinion (alleged tampering in EVMs).

He alleged that votes in minorities dominated areas, which were considered BSP vote bank and from where Muslim candidates were in fray, going in favour of the BJP indicated ""foul play"" by the saffron party.

Notably, BSP chief Mayawati, whose party received a major drubbing in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, had alleged that the EVMs were tampered with in such a way that whichever button was pressed, the vote went to BJP soon after election results came out.

Terming the results as ""shocking"", she had said the Election Commission should stop the counting and withhold results and hold fresh polls using traditional paper ballots. She had said it was ""unacceptable"" that the BJP was winning even in Muslim-dominated areas.

""Muslims constitute 20 per cent votes in the state and the BJP did not give a single ticket to Muslims...but in Muslim-dominated seats also the results went in the BJP's favour and this is unpalatable to the party,"" Mayawati had said.

Mr Singh said BSP will continue its protest against the BJP government till the party is removed from power by public. The BSP has already filed a petition in the Supreme Court in this connection, he said, adding re-poll should be conducted in UP using ballot papers.","ghaziabad:"
"284","Rigged EVMs? Then How Do You Explain Me, Says Amarinder Singh",NA,"a second senior leader of the congress has stood up to defend the electronic voting machine or evm amid the party's allegation of tampering. amarinder singh, the chief minister of punjab - the only state the congress won outright in the recent round of assembly elections -- cited a simple logic: ""if evms were fixed then i wouldn't be sitting here. the akalis would be.""

the congress had won 77 of punjab's 117 seats, ending the decade-long rule of the akali-bjp alliance. but this morning, it joined the other opposition parties to petition the election commission against the use of machines. the parties allege that the machines were rigged, which made the bjp's sweeping victory in recent elections in uttar pradesh and uttarakhand possible.

but former law minister veerappa moily, who represented the congress at the meeting, said he favoured updating technology and an investigation by a ""high powered committee into the allegations"". there, however, was ""no question of going manually, it's not a progressive step. i don't think we should go back,"" he said.

""we are censoring our own system. evms were launched when we were in power,"" mr moily told ndtv, standing by his comment that blaming evms for electoral losses was ""defeatist."" concerns about evms had been raised even when the congress was in power, and the machines had been tested, he added.

the statement by the two leaders fly in the face of comments by party leaders like ghulam nabi azad, and opposition leaders like aam aadmi party's arvind kejriwal and bsp's mayawati, who had demanded that the election commission ditch evms and revert to old-style ballot papers.

the commission, which had repeatedly defended the evms, said this afternoon that in may, it would hold a hackathon, in which non-believers could try and hack the machines.

the complaints against the evms started after a controversial demonstration of a machine madhya pradesh's bhind district, which had allegedly been used in kanpur days before.

the opposition parties claimed that the video of a demonstration by an election officer showed an evm recording a vote in favour of the bjp irrespective of which party was selected. the election commission had said the machine in question was an unused vvpat or voter verified audit slip facility, which was kept in reserve during the elections in uttar pradesh. the commission had also pointed out that the 45-day cooling off period that is necessary for an evm is not required for a vvpat machine."

"292","BJP Strong No 2 In West Bengal By-Poll, Top Leaders Assigned To Win State","                             After shocking the Left by placing second in this week's assembly by-election in West Bengal behind the ruling Trinamool Congress, the BJP has launched a 'Mission Bengal' that aims at preparing the party to make major inroads in the panchayat or local elections to be held next year. The party is sending senior leaders to West Bengal to interact with workers as it builds its cadre in a state where it held no assembly seats till last year's election.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was in Hooghly yesterday, and today, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharati are in Kolkata and Howrah.

The Kanthi Dakshin assembly constituency yesterday sent a Trinamool Congress legislator to the Bengal assembly again, but it was the BJP's performace that drew all the attention. The party placed second, ahead of number 3 Left by at least 30,000 votes. BJP chief Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted special thanks to West Bengal's voters and Mr Shah declared the BJP ""the principal opposition party"" in the state.

In assembly elections less than a year ago, the BJP had placed a distant third behind the Trinamool and the Left in Kanthi Dakshin, with only 15,000 votes and less than 9 per cent vote share. It has almost 31 per cent of the vote share this time.

The Trinamool has improved its vote share by two per cent. The Left, which ruled the state for three decades before losing to Mamata Banerjee in 2011, has only 10 per cent of the vote share this time, while the Congress, main opposition for years, is a faraway fourth with a little over one per cent.

Ahead of the by-election, the BJP and its ideological mentor the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worked hard to expand the party's footprint in East Midnapore where Kanthi Dakshin is. The BJP's strong performance in the Trinamool stronghold is also being credited to its Ram Navami mobilisation.

Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attacked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's government on Thursday, saying, ""Ram Navami celebrations have happened peacefully everywhere in India. Why is it not happening in West Bengal? And why should you stop just one community from celebrating festivals? It's a total failure of the law and order machinery here.""

The Narada sting was released just before the assembly elections in West Bengal last year but last week the Calcutta High Court said prima facie it seemed to be a cognizable offence and ordered the CBI to investigate. The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court after leaders of Mamata Banerjee's party appealed against the move.

BJP protesters, who marched from College Square near the party office to Esplanade less than 5 km away, got into a scuffle with the police at Esplanade as the police put up barriers to stop the protesters from entering the main square at Esplanade. An effigy with the faces of the politicians seen in the Narada sting was burnt right beside the barricade. ""Not just the Minister seen in the tape, the Chief Minister should also resign as she is leading a corrupt government,"" BJP leader Chandra Bose said. Mr Bose had contested against Mamata Banerjee in the Assembly elections last year.

""Make room for 30-40 people in jail. First start with 12 people and gradually all the secrets will be out in and the space in jail will run out. TMC has big leaders, it will take time to make 5 star arrangements inside the jail,"" Rajya Sabha lawmaker and BJP leader Roopa Ganguly said.

But it's not just the BJP that is upping the ante against Mamata Banerjee as the Trinamool finds itself in an embarrassing position after the Narada sting operation. The Congress has planned a similar rally in the city on Saturday and the Left is also targeting Mamata Banerjee for protecting her partymen.

""The administration is busy protecting the culprits and falsely implicating the whistle-blower. Now, Mamata will have to rush to Modi government to seek support to save themselves from CBI probe,"" CPI(M) lawmaker Mohammad Salim said.

Meanwhile, the man behind the Narada sting operation case, Mathew Samuel has complained to the Kerala Director General of Police and the Station House Officer (SHO) of Dwarka Police Station in the capital about a threat to him, his family and colleagues after what he describes as several instances of his colleagues and family members being followed by unknown men. Mr Samuel has claimed the suspicious people shadowing him could be an attempt to eliminate him and has demanded an inquiry.","kolkata:"

That Includes The Chief Minister.","                             Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered the removal of beacons from all government vehicles, including his own. Mr Singh seems to be a man on a mission to revive the Congress, which has been performing poorly in elections in other states. After getting a majority in Punjab's recently-held assembly elections, the Chief Minister seized the opportunity and swung into action. Putting a ban on the use of 'lal battis', or red beacons on government vehicles is one of the first major decisions taken by the new government in the state.

""Red beacons were removed from the vehicles of the Chief Minister and other members of the council of ministers on Saturday itself, without waiting for a notification, soon after the Congress government decided to put a ban on its use,"" an official spokesperson said.

In a series of austere measures, the Amarinder Singh-led cabinet also decided to ban ministers from traveling overseas for two years. It also banned organising of banquets on state expense as part of the government's move to shed VIP frills. This, the party says, is in line with their election manifesto. ""In our manifesto, the Chief Minister and cabinet ministers were exempted. Despite this they decided to bring themselves within the ambit of the decision,"" the Congress' spokesperson said.

Punjab is currently burdened by a huge debt inherited from the previous government in the state. This has been done ""to clean up the system of the much-talked-about VIP culture, that has been a massive expense on the state's exchequer over the years,"" the party's spokesman added.

During the previous government, Punjab, which was already under thousands of crores of rupees in debt, had spent Rs. 97 crore to buy luxury vehicles for its political top brass over a period of eight years, an RTI application had revealed in June last year. The vehicles were purchased between 2007 and 2015 by the transport department for the use of then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, his son and then Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and other ministers, as per the Right to Information (RTI) reply given to activist Jasdeepak Singh.

The transport department in Punjab had spent the highest - Rs. 17,77,92,929 in 2012-2013 on vehicles and Rs. 8,38,28,895 in 2008-09. The expenditure incurred during 2014-15 was Rs. 13,13,90,655.

The process of finalisation of the policy on the use of red beacons on government vehicles, except those used in an emergency like ambulance or fire brigade, and those of the Chief Justice and the Judges of Punjab and Haryana High Court, has started. ""Once the necessary notification is issued, all government departments would have to strictly implement it,"" Congress' spokesperson added.

The process of implementation of other cabinet decisions has also been initiated, the spokesperson said, adding that all decisions would be executed in a time-bound manner, with the Chief Minister and the ministers personally monitoring it to ensure that there is no default or delay.

The Amarinder Singh cabinet, in its first meeting on Saturday, has taken over 120 decisions.","chandigarh:"

Hours before the crucial trust vote, the economic blockade in the state, which lasted for 130 days, was lifted. The blockade, which was led by the United Naga Council, ended after talks were successful with the central and state governments. ""We have fulfilled the promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by convincing the UNC to lift the blockade,"" Chief Minister Biren Singh told NDTV last evening. PM Modi had vowed to remove the blockade if BJP was elected to power in a state ruled by the Congress for 15 years under Okram Ibobi Singh. This is the first time a BJP government is heading the state.

The BJP and the Congress are keeping their cards close to the chest ahead of today's crucial trust vote in the Manipur Assembly. 17 of the BJP's 21 newly elected legislators have been camping at a hotel in Assam's Guwahati.

""We have kept our legislators in Guwahati in response to the Congress keeping their MLAs in a house in Imphal. Our legislators thought we must also stand united,"" said Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP's key strategist for Manipur.

No party received a simple majority in the 2017 Manipur assembly election. The Congress, which had ruled the state for 3 consecutive terms (15 years), emerged as a single largest party with 28 of the total 60 seats. The BJP, which debuted in the state, came second with 21 seats. A party needs a minimum support of 31 legislators to form a government in Manipur.

The BJP says it has the support of 33 legislators with the help of the NPP, NPF, LJP, an independent legislator, a Trinamool Congress MLA, and Shyam Kumar - a defector from the Congress - who took oath as a minister in the N Biren Singh government. Speaking to NDTV, Trinamool Congress legislator Robindro Singh said the party gave him full freedom to support the BJP. ""I spoke to (senior TMC leader) Mukul Roy. They left it to me.

The Amarinder Singh-government had offered a suitable bungalow to Badal, a five-time Chief Minister of Punjab.

Mr Badal said, ""I am thankful to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for his gracious gesture. It is very graceful of him to make this offer. But I am making my own arrangements for stay. I value his sentiment highly and fully reciprocate it.""

The veteran Akali leader's aides are hunting for a house for him in the town's Sector 8 for a week now.

Mr Badal's family owns two big-sized plots of residential land, measuring almost 1.5 acres, in upscale Sector 9, but a new structure is coming up after the old one was pulled down.

Mr Badal, 89, lived in the chief ministerial bungalow in Chandigarh's tony Sector 2 before his Shiromani Akali Dal was routed in the February 4 assembly elections.

Since Mr Badal is only a legislator from Lambi and his party has only 15 legislators in the new assembly, he does not qualify for the status of Leader of Opposition and hence not officially entitled to a government bungalow.

So, his coming to Gujarat for campaigning will definitely help the BJP,"" he professed. Since taking office, Yogi Adityanath has operated in top gear, implementing major policies important to the BJP even though the new cabinet has yet to meet. The police is patrolling public spaces to protect women as part of the Yogi's commitment to urgently correcting Uttar Pradesh's depraved lawlessness; slaughterhouses are being checked and sealed for violating laws, a move that critics say targets Muslims who run most abattoirs.

The Chief Minister's surprise check at a police station in the heart of Lucknow and along the banks of the River Gomti to ensure the newly-developed area is pristine, his visit to a gang-rape survivor in hospital, his announcement that his administration will favour no caste or religion, have all given him prime positioning in the news cycle. The BJP in Gujarat says that because of its size and political vitality, UP and its Chief Minister will influence voters heavily in the coastal state too.

However, the party was quick to stress that nothing competes with the star power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Ever since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, it has been a matter of pride for people in Gujarat and for us... the Modi wave itself is enough,"" said Mr Pandya, referring to the pole position of the PM in his party's sweeping victory in Uttar Pradesh.

The BJP has governed the PM's home state of Gujarat since 1998; it is seeking a fifth consecutive term. The party has deployed the slogan ""UP mein 325, Gujarat mein 150"" (325 seats in UP, 150 in Gujarat) to indicate it wants to win the upcoming election with the sort of record margin it accrued in India's most-populous state.

The opposition Congress claims that the BJP's invite to the Yogi signals its plan to polarise voters by religion. Party spokesperson Himanshu Patel claimed that the plan will not succeed and that the BJP will stumble over its conflict with former supporters the Patels, who have turned on the party for not being included in affirmative action policies, and over its inability to prevent attacks on Dalits in Gujarat.

Over the weekend, a riot in the Patan district of Gujarat killed one person and injured 14 others after a fight erupted between Muslim and Hindu school students.","gandhinagar:"
"309","'Dal Main Kaala', Says Mamata Banerjee On BJP's Victory In Uttar Pradesh","                             West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed serious doubt over the massive mandate won by the BJP in the recently held assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. ""Dal main kuch kaala hain (Something is fishy),"" she said on the BJP's victory, further intensifying the debate surrounding the functioning of electronic voting machines or EVMs.

Ms Banerjee, who heads the Trinamool Congress, claimed that the arithmetic of BJP's victory in Uttar Pradesh does not add up.

""How come, without doing anything and with the negative impact of demonetisation, the BJP got more than 300 seats? There is something wrong and fishy about it. Mayawati has raised doubts about EVMs and I think they still have the opportunity to challenge its functioning in courts,"" said the West Bengal Chief Minister in an interview to ABP Ananda, a local Bengali channel.

She further advised Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati to forge an alliance against the BJP.

In the interview, Ms Banerjee also launched a scathing attack on the BJP, which is looking to expand its footprint in West Bengal. Speaking on the Narada tapes, she accused the centre of conspiring against the Trinamool.

""It is a communal and political conspiracy by the BJP to stop Trinamool Congress from emerging as a contender against it in national politics,"" Ms Banerjee claimed.

Interestingly, the West Bengal Chief Minister admitted that nominating industrialist KD Singh, who is said to have funded the sting, to the Rajya Sabha as a TMC candidate was a mistake.

""I thought he was a man with good credentials. But nominating KD Singh as a Rajya Sabha MP was a mistake. Sometimes, you learn from your mistakes,"" Ms Banerjee said.

Ms Banerjee also claimed that the BJP had approached a leader from her to try and split Trinamool with the promise of making him Chief Minister of West Bengal.

"311","Life Term For Cow Slaughter In Gujarat, Assembly Clears Tougher Law","                             Punishment for cow slaughter in Gujarat will be a life term after an amended law was cleared on the last day of the state assembly session today. Gujarat, where elections will be held later this year, now has the toughest law against cow slaughter in the country.

The Gujarat Animal Preservation Act of 1954 also says the punishment for transporting of cows will be 10 years in jail.

In the current law, which was amended in 2011, the maximum jail term for cow slaughter was seven years. The new law also increases penalty from Rs. 1 lakh to 5 lakh.

The bill was passed in the absence of the opposition Congress, which had walked out on some other subject.

Over the past few weeks, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has often talked about bring in harsher laws to protect cattle. The BJP is committed to protect ""Gau (cow), Ganga and Gita"", he declared earlier this month. This was days after the ruling BJP won giant victories in state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, where the party has appointed as Chief Minister the saffron-robed Yogi Adityanath - one of its loudest cow protection campaigners.

Yogi Adityanath has also been invited to campaign in Gujarat, a move that the opposition Congress says indicates a plan to polarize voters.

The slaughter and transport of cows was banned in Gujarat in 2011, when the state was ruled by Narendra Modi, now Prime Minister.

The BJP has governed the PM's home state since 1998. As it seeks a fifth consecutive term this year, it faces the challenge of disenchantment among its former supporters the Patels over quota and anger over attacks on Dalits.

The party's slogan ""UP mein 325, Gujarat mein 150"" (325 seats in UP, 150 in Gujarat) conveys its aim to win Gujarat with a record margin, the sort it won in India's most populous state.","ahmedabad:"

""I wanted to see the people because of whose hard work the party has got such a massive win,"" the Chief Minister said. The guest list comprised senior ministers in his team and the two Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma.

The 44-year-old Chief Minister - who represented Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat in eastern Uttar Pradesh for nearly two decades - has said he was told about his new job just a day before he took oath on March 19.

Questions have been raised about the motives of Mathew Samuel and his decision to release the tapes in March last year, just before Assembly elections in the state, two years after he had shot them. Who funded the sting that gave away nearly 80 lakh rupees is still a grey area.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court refused to give in to the Bengal government's demand and call off the CBI investigation into the case, which was ordered by the Calcutta High Court on 17 March. The top court has given the agency a month's time to come up with a report in the case, in which leaders of Trinamool were purportedly seen accepting huge wads of cash from the reporter posing as a man wanting to set up a company in Bengal and seeking favours from the government.

Mathew Samuel was a journalist with Tehelka when he conducted the sting operation back in 2014, just before the Lok Sabha elections. At the time, the owner of Tehelka was Trinamool lawmaker KD Singh.

Mulayam Singh, the party's 77-year-old founder, whose son Akhilesh Yadav is running for a second consecutive term as Chief Minister.

His insistence on allying with the Congress was one of the reasons for an epic war between Akhilesh Yadav and his father that placed their party dangerously close to splitting ahead of the election in Uttar Pradesh, seen as a bellwether for the national election of 2019.

Mr Maurya said public support for PM Modi cuts across castes
Exit polls have predicted BJP getting 211 of 403 seats in the assembly
                                The BJP's performance in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections will exceed the simple majority predicted by exit polls and hover around the 300 mark, the party's state party chief Keshav Prasad Maurya told NDTV on Friday, hours before counting of votes for the 403-seat assembly begins.

Mr Maurya said the broad-based public support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi across castes that had delivered a landslide 71 out of 80 seats in India's most populous state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was intact, and would not only be repeated in 2017 assembly elections but in the 2019 general elections too.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he said, conceded defeat when he started talking about tying up with the BSP's Mayawati. ""The BJP believes he can tie up with his aunt, friend Rahul (Gandhi)... with whoever he wants. But the BJP is going to get such big numbers that the BSP and SP are going to be uprooted,"" he said. And you don't need to wait all day for the results. He said the message from the people will be clear by 11 a.m.

An aggregate of the poll of exit polls suggests that the BJP - which contested the election against the BSP led by Mayawati and the SP-Congress combine under Akhilesh Yadav's leadership without a chief ministerial face - has a clear edge in Uttar Pradesh.

The state BJP president said his confidence didn't stem from the exit poll results but on the strength of the party's 1.4 lakh polling booth-level committees and the hard work put in by party workers over the last 10 months. The Lok Sabha member from the Phulpur seat - that was once represented by Jawaharlal Nehru - was elevated as state party unit chief in April last year, a surprise decision that was calculated to reach out to non-Yadav OBCs in the state.

It is a strategy that some experts believe may have delivered dividends for the BJP. Mr Maurya insists the appeal of PM Modi - who he called the messiah of the poor - cuts across caste divisions by the SP, BSP and the Congress.","lucknow:"

The party won 17 seats, and the BJP trailed with 13 in the 40-member assembly. Nine seats went to the others - three for the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP, three for the Goa Forward Party and 3 Independents - who will hold the key to government formation in the state.

The MGP -- which is part of an alliance with the Shiv Sena and the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM -- had broken its alliance with the BJP in January. The Shiv Sena, whose chief Uddhav Thackeray said he would not enter any alliance with the BJP again.

Exit polls had predicted that the BJP could retain Goa. Three out of four exit polls did not rule out a majority for the party and only one predicted a hung house. The aggregate gave the BJP 18 of the state's 40 seats.

But by the afternoon, the party's setback became apparent. BJP Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost to Congress rival Dayanand Sopte from Goa's Mandrem constituency.

Party chief Amit Shah, however, said, ""The results are very encouraging for the BJP, we are going to form government in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur"".

The Congress government of Digambar Kamat had lost the state in 2012 -- trailing the BJP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party combine with only nine seats. The BJP had won 21 seats and the MGP three, which added up to a comfortable majority.

The focus is on whether the BJP will be able to retain power and if it gets a fresh mandate, will Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar return to his home state as chief minister.

The fate of Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, whose Mandrem constituency will be taken up for counting during the first round, will be decided within the first hour of the counting.

The postal ballots and votes polled by service voters will be taken up first before calculating the numbers on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).

Tight security arrangements have been made with over 1,000 policemen deployed.

Election officials said the counting will be completed by 2.30 PM.

The votes for 19 constituencies will be counted at Panaji in North Goa, while the tally for the remaining 21 will be carried out in Margao in South Goa.

The elections held on February 4 witnessed an enthusiastic response of voters, with polling clocking in at 83 per cent.

The election has five former chief ministers besides the incumbent CM in the fray.

The Congress, the prime opponent of the BJP, has fielded four former chief ministers -- Digambar Kamat, Pratapsinh Rane, Ravi Naik and Luizinho Faleiro in their respective constituencies, while the NCP has given a ticket to Churchill Alemao.

The main fight expected to be between the Congress and the BJP, while the AAP has also put up a spirited fight on 39 seats.

The BJP has fielded 36 candidates, supporting Independents in Benaulim, Navelim, Priol and Velim. The Congress has candidates on 37 seats and has extended support to United Goans' Atanasio Monserratte in Panaji, Goa Forward's Vinod Palyekar in Siolim and Independent candidate Rohan Khaunte in Porvorim constituencies.

The BJP's major worry is an alliance between the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, the Shiv Sena and Rebel RSS leader Subhash Velingkar-led Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM).

She lost with a record margin, got only 90 votes
Congress Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh won by 10,470 votes
                                Manipur is not happy with Irom Sharmila. The 'Iron Lady' who had taken on Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, has lost with a record margin, polling only 90 votes. The three-time Chief Minister won comfortably with a margin of 10,740 votes. Ms Sharmila's chance of securing a seat in the 70-member assembly now rests on Khurai, the other seat from where she is contesting.

The 44-year-old rights activist had faced the anger of the people after she stopped her 16-year fast last year against the Armed Forces' Special Powers Act or AFSPA. She said she wanted to take the political route and become the Chief Minister to continue her agitation.

Her fledgling party, PRJA (Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance), had the support of the Left and Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party. But her claims had failed to convince a large section of people who earlier supported her.","thoubal:"

"351","Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: A 360 Degree View Of BJP's Landslide Win",NA,"(here is a 360 degree view of the celebrations taking place outside the bjp office in lucknow)

the bjp had learnt many lessons from its 2015 debacle in the bihar assembly elections. one of them was not to celebrate too soon, and wait for the election trends to stabilise. today, as a small group of workers came in early at the party's lucknow office, there were no advance deliveries of flowers or sweets.

and then, the results started trickling in. as the spread and margin of the bjp's spectacular victory in the uttar pradesh elections started sinking in, the crowds started swelling, getting louder and colourful. the bjp needed 202 seats to come to power in the 403-seat assembly. it ended up with a landslide score of 312. but as the trend became clearer towards noon, people brought in the sweets, flowers and colours. it was holi two days in advance -- workers danced to victory slogans, hugged each other and sprayed each other with colours as the party's gains seemed irreversible.

""uttar pradesh has fulfilled our dream of 300 seats this time,"" declared keshav prasad maurya, the state party chief who got the job just 11 months ago. soon, his face too was smeared with colour by jubilant party workers.

less than 3 km away, outside the samajwadi party office, party workers had removed congress vice president rahul gandhi's cut-outs from outside the party office well before the counting started. later chief minister akhilesh yadav insisted the alliance would survive the crash landing. for a long time, small groups of party workers who had gathered spoke with hope how the trends could change. others trooped to the temple down the road.

a few hours later, they gave up. the writing was on the wall.

by the evening, the bjp had won 312 seats and a 39 per cent vote, just three percentage points less than 2014 general elections' 42 per cent vote share when the party had netted 71 of the state's 80 lok sabha seats.

the office of the congress, which conceded that its organisational structure in the state was in shambles, wore a deserted look through the day. ditto the bsp office that ended in the third place, after the bjp and the sp.

but if the bjp's one-step-at-a-time approach ensured it did not trip during either the campaign, or the celebrations, the aap seemed to trip in the all guns blazing style. it repeated the bjp's mistake in bihar, possibly encouraged by the exit polls that forecast it was within striking distance in punjab.

before the counting started, enthusiastic party workers had gathered outside delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal's home. the venue was decorated with rows of green, saffron and white balloons and led screens installed to keep the crowds informed about the good news as it comes. and then there was a stack of brooms, the party's election symbol that could be waved for the cameras. aap did end up as the second largest party in punjab - a distant second. late in the evening, the brooms were quietly packed up and taken away."

"356","So In 2019, It Will Be Modi Versus The Rest"," 
Mayawati chose to ignore the fact that she was skating on thin ice for some years; her inability to widen the social base of the BSP would eventually lead to her party's decimation. She was also unprepared for the BJP's aggressive outreach to the Dalits whom she regarded as her permanent captives. This outreach was different from Rahul Gandhi's periodic forays into Dalit hutments and photo-ops over pre-arranged dinners. Amit Shah's outreach, on the other hand, was systematic and sustained. With the BJP/RSS cadre directed to make and maintain regular touch with non-Jatav Dalits, Mayawati's policy of talking down to her supporters increasingly gave offence even to her core followers. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it was apparent that a large segment of Dalits had voted for Modi's cross-caste appeal. But this was dismissed by the BSP leadership as a one-off phenomenon, blaming the partial desertion by a section of Dalits on the mesmerizing effect of Narendra Modi. But nobody expected this effect to spill over into the assembly polls.

Clearly, the erosion of the BSP's citadel has begun. The BJP's highly publicized delivery of pro-poor benefits such as LPG cylinders under the Ujjwala scheme has endeared the party even to those sections that hitherto considered the BJP ""untouchable"". Over the next few years, BJP governments in Delhi and Lucknow will surely consolidate their electoral base through effective delivery of promises made. By the time the 2019 Lok Sabha polls arrive, the BSP may find to its dismay that its enire Dalit constituency has been swept away by the BJP.

The present round of assembly elections and their results marks a paradigm shift in India's political idiom. For decades, the Congress has been regarded as a left-of-centre, pro-poor party which authored a slew of economic reforms aimed at subsidizing the underprivileged. During all this time, the BJP was seen as a right-of-centre party, favouring industrialists and the upper middle class. Since coming to power in April 2014, the BJP government under Narendra Modi has transformed the party's image almost completely and successfully projected itself as a welfarist party committed to the social and economic upliftment of the underprivileged. This metamorphosis of its image has enabled the BJP to redraw the ideological contours of India's politics, as evident from the assembly election results.

Much to the bewilderment of economic and political pundits, the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes added to the BJP's popular appeal. All those who travelled across rural areas of poll-bound states, especially UP, (including this writer) discovered that the rural poor believed that holders of black money and other economically affluent sections were the worst hit by demonetization. The difficulty faced by the poor was brushed aside as temporary inconvenience for a larger cause for the greater good of society. Thus, the demonetization gambit reinforced Modi's image as a crusader for the poor and against the corrupt. That most opposition parties bitterly opposed ""notebandi"" worked against them. It was widely perceived that they were against demonetization only because they were inconvenienced by the loss of ill-gotten resources. Hereafter it will be nearly impossible to dislodge Modi from the pedestal of Messiah of the poor, the same way as Indira Gandhi acquired this aura following bank nationalization and the abolition of privy purses.

The noticeable aspect of the present election results is that more than the major parties, it is the regional outfits which are facing decimation. The BSP's base seems destined to slowly wither away unless something dramatic happens. As for AAP, the absence of major corruption scandals in the Modi regime has robbed the party of its principal plank. The Samajwadi Party may recover some of its lost ground in the years to come, but it will have to steadfastly rebuild itself on planks other than caste/community coalitions. A substantial section of younger Yadavs aspiring to reach the top layers of an India in transformation voted for the BJP this time. If Modi can continue to deliver at this rate, it will deal a body blow to the politics of identity in the coming years.

Arguably, the BJP could not wipe the slate clean. The Akalis' misgovernance was a huge drag which cost the BJP a great amount of goodwill in Punjab. But this should be an eye-opener about the quality of alliances the BJP gets into; already the Shiv Sena is posing considerable challenges to the Maharashtra government. The BJP must also be prepared for most opposition parties banding together as a Grand Alliance to defeat Modi in 2019. But if the ideological and idiomatic shift of politics, as witnessed in the present round of assembly elections holds good, a Modi Versus The Rest showdown in 2019 will be to the BJP's advantage, for it will be presented as a contest between the Old, Conservative Order versus the Young, Aspirational India. No guessing then as to which side electoral fortunes will favour.

The facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of NDTV and NDTV does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.","the spectacular victory of the bjp in the present round of assembly elections has raised existential questions for several of its opponents. the congress has managed to save its face somehow by winning punjab convincingly and goa by a whisker, while the outcome of manipur is still wide open. but the thrashing received by the party in up can hardly be compensated with a few consolation prizes. rahul gandhi can try to evade responsibility for the washout in up by claiming that the congress was the junior partner in the alliance, but from all accounts, the samajwadi party was dragged down by the congress and not the other way around. it is being universally argued that akhilesh yadav would have done better to go it alone. unlike up, the congress has nobody to blame for its rout in uttarakhand, where chief minister harish rawat himself lost from both the seats he contested.

apart from the congress, whose steady decline as a national alternative to the bjp has been clear for some time, the unexpected collapse of the bsp in up and the failure of the aam aadmi party to make a breakthrough in punjab raise serious questions for the leadership of both these parties."
"357","Exit Polls May Prove Wrong - But On Modi, They're Clear"," pollsters could be wrong.

Take UP, the state steals the limelight in these elections, because of its political weight. If you plot the predictions of the BJP vote and seats (see chart below) you will find that most of them have coalesced around 33% vote share and anything between 165-200 seats.Two of them have, however, proclaimed big majorities for the BJP. Of these, the News 24 Chanakya poll gives the BJP almost the same vote share as the 2014 Lok Sabha election, but trims their seats by 50 for a final count of 285. This is almost the result that would come about if you took the 2014 Lok Sabha data by assembly segments and introduced the SP-INC alliance, making it a three-cornered fight. In other words, News24 is saying that the Modi Wave of 2014 holds good in 2017. While that may be true of the later of seven phases of voting, the BJP and its supporters all admit that in the first two phases, where 140 seats were decided, the BJP under-performed considerably as compared to 2014.

Some polling also shows that Muslim consolidation around the SP-Congress could possibly have triggered a Hindu consolidation around the BJP especially in the later phases of voting. In 2014, the BJP swept eastern UP, so such a scenario remains possible. If you don't buy the consolidation of votes and so exclude the News24 projections as an outlier, then the poll of polls changes, though it continues to show the BJP well ahead but just under a majority:The other concern for the BJP would be that almost all polls have shown their vote share in UP dropping to 32-36% from 43% in 2014. That is a greater drop than happened in Bihar, and again reflects the purported early setbacks. Similarly, the SP-Congress should be very disappointed that their vote share has hardly moved from 2014 - it has declined by 6% compared to what both parties polled together in 2012. And this probably reflects the reality on the ground, where SP leaders felt that Congress votes did not transfer to them.If the polls are correct, the Congress in particular has much to be unhappy about. If all the worst-case scenarios play out for the Congress: losing Punjab, a thumping in Uttarakhand, no comeback in Goa and possibly losing Manipur, Saturday could be a very bleak day for the party.The tragedy for the Congress in Punjab is that if they win, it will be because of Captain Amarinder Singh, and if they fail to get a majority, the Captain has said he plans to retire, so the Congress will be left rudderless. Similarly, not winning in Goa will shows its inability to win against incumbency (the BJP governs the state) and losing Manipur will underscore the growing strength of the BJP in the North East.

The exit polls in Punjab also reflect two other trends: the collapse of the Akalis and with them, the BJP, is reflected in all the polls; and the continued growth of AAP shows that 2014 was not a flash in the pan and they are emerging as a major national player.If AAP wins Punjab, as some polls indicate, then not only will the Congress be worried, having lost to them heavily in Delhi, so will the BJP, whom they plan to challenge in Gujarat later this year.

In less than 12 hours, the actual results will start coming in, and many exit poll predictions will be proved wrong. Wrong, because polling isn't a science: it is a projection from a sample. The problem is that in homogenous countries, it is easier to project from small samples, but in places like UP, where more than hundreds of sub-castes exist and caste-wise voting is often the case, pollsters face the enormously difficult job of choosing their samples correctly. Now if you launch such polls across seven diverse phases, the chances of being wrong increase.","whatever else the exit polls may or may not say, they do confirm the big election story - that prime minister narendra modi has almost single-handedly lifted the bjp in uttar pradesh from the depths of despair to one where they are predicted to win outright or at least emerge as the largest single party. in doing so, he has not only established himself as campaigner-par-excellence but politically put to bed any adverse impact of demonetization. and if those polls that project huge majorities in up, uttarakhand and even manipur turn out to be correct, then the political landscape will have changed dramatically.

while this euphoria over the forecast of a bjp sweep, except in punjab, may have those on twitter celebrating, the political class itself remains much more circumspect. even bjp leaders are not popping the champagne, as memories of bihar's exit polls being completely wrong still linger in their minds. and if you look at the gamut of predictions for tomorrow, it is obvious that some, many, or may be all "

A party needs to get 36 seats to form government.

The News24-Today's Chanakya survey gives the BJP a huge majority at 53 seats, while the India Today Axis exit poll says the party will get 46 to 53. India News-MRC shows the BJP at 38 and the Congress at 30. ABP Lokniti predicts the BJP will get between 34-42, Congress 23-29 and others 3-9.

The India TV-C-Voter poll however shows both parties getting 29-35 each, with other parties wining 2-9 seats, crucial if there is a hung house.

The 2012 elections had thrown up a hung assembly, with the Congress winning 32 seats and the BJP 31. The Congress was helped by Mayawati's BSP, Independents and others to cross the majority mark. ","highlightstwo out of four exit polls show win for bjp

The poll of exit polls said the Congress, which trailed the BJP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party combine with only 9 seats, is likely to increase its tally to 12.

Arvind Kejriwal's AAP -- which entered the fray in Goa with high hopes but has been portrayed as an outsider by both BJP and the Congress, is likely to win 3 seats.

If the BJP misses the majority, the role of its former ally MGP can be crucial. After withdrawing its support to the government in January, the party has entered an alliance with the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM and Shiv Sena. Last month, the Shiv Sena had announced that it won't enter into an alliance with the BJP again.

While exit polls are known for going wide off the mark, whether they got it right this time can be known on Saturday, March 11. From 7 am, the votes for all the states that went to polls - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - will be counted.

Votes will be counted from 8 am on Saturday in India's most politically crucial state, where the results will be seen as an indicator for the 2019 national election.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati and other leaders campaigned exhaustively here, addressing multiple rallies.

Uttar Pradesh, the country's biggest state with over 22 crore people, has been through long spells of President's rule, hung verdicts, mass defections and mid-term polls.

Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati ended a spell of instability when in 2007, she won a spectacular victory based on her social engineering formula that went beyond her traditional Dalit vote bank to reach out to the upper castes. In the next election in 2012, it was Akhilesh Yadav's turn to celebrate after winning comfortably.

Uttar Pradesh has been placed under President's rule 10 times, the last time in 2002.

There is hardly any combination that has not been tried in the state.

In the late 1990s, the BJP and Mayawati came together with a plan to rotate the chief minister's post between the parties for a six-month period - an experiment that didn't work.

Of the 16 state assemblies elected since 1952, a single party won a majority and completed a full five-year term only seven times. Nine times, governments were short-lived - one lasted four months.

Mid-term elections have been called as many as seven times; the last time was in 1998.

Uttar Pradesh was the base and the favourite hunting ground for the Congress in the initial years after Independence, when many top leaders leading state and national politics. But it was this state that became the first to get a non-Congress government. ","lucknow:"
"367","UP Elections 2017: Samajwadi Minister Questions Tie-up With Congress Ahead Of Vote Count","                             Cracks appeared in the ruling Samajwadi Party ahead of the Saturday vote count for the crucial state assembly elections, as a senior minister questioned the benefits of aligning with the Congress.

Senior Samajwadi leader and a minister in the Akhilesh Yadav cabinet, Ravidas Mehrotra, while questioning the SP-Congress alliance, said the SP would have won on its own and there was no need for this tie-up with the Congress. He also said that in the final outcome the Congress would have gained from the alliance and not the Samajwadi Party.

While senior party leaders and workers have been questioning the tie-up right since beginning, it had so far been in private. Mehrotra is the first to have expressed his feelings openly in public.

In a related development, Urban Development Minister Mohd Adam Khan, said in case the SP lost at the hustings, the blame would not be of Akhilesh Yadav alone.

""Khuda na kare aisi naubat aaye, gar aisa hua to iski zimmedari sabki hoga aur ye nuksaan poore pradesh ka hoga (God forbid that such a result happens then the responsibility should be shared by all),"" he said.

He also said that Mulayam Singh Yadav's wife Sadhna Gupta's statement that ""Akhilesh should not have humiliated his father"" in a recent interview ""could have been avoided"".

SP contested the assembly elections in alliance with the Congress which was given 105 seats and the remaining 298 were contested by it. Voting for the 403 seats of the UP assembly will be counted at 75 counting centres in the state from 8am on Saturday.","lucknow:"
"368","UP Election Results 2017: When Many Political Bigwigs Were MIA, Among Other Firsts"," HighlightsExit polls predict clear victory for BJP, getting 211 of 403 seats
Not ruling out post poll alliance with BSP, says Akhilesh Yadav
Elections in the state were held in seven phases
                                The much-anticipated climax of the high decibel assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is just a few hours away. The seven-phased polls spread over a month of voting had its share of firsts, avoidable gaffes and embarrassing statements.

It was for the first time since 1999 that Congress President Sonia Gandhi didn't campaign in Uttar Pradesh, from where she and son Rahul Gandhi are members of the Lok Sabha. She is currently undergoing medical treatment abroad.

It was also unusual that BJP veterans LK Advani and Kanpur MP Murli Manohar Joshi didn't hit the campaign trail. Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and the presumptive Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, before the Congress struck an alliance with the SP, also remained absent.

Another bigwig Samajwadi Party patriarch and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was also missing in action, well mostly, and campaigned only for daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, who contested from Lucknow Cantt and brother Shivpal Singh Yadav in Jaswantnagar. In contrast, he had addressed at least 300 rallies during the 2012 elections.

After a poll of exit polls last evening showed the BJP getting 211 of the state's 403 assembly seats, Mr Akhilesh, who had earlier ruled out a post-poll alliance with the BSP, said that if there is a hung assembly, he will prefer a partnership with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party over President's Rule in the state. Who would have imagined that?

Mulayam Singh's second wife Sadhna Gupta, just hours before the last round of polling in Poorvanchal, alleged in an hour-long interview that ""no matter what, nobody should have disrespected Netaji, it is he who founded and nurtured the party"". After staying quiet for the past two decades, this was Ms Sadhna's first public outing.

The UP elections were held in seven phases. Counting of votes will begin at 8am on March 11.

Among many interesting events in the state, one polling station in the remote Saikul constituency in the newly created Kangpokpi district saw voting thrice this season.

Saikul, 60km away from Imphal, has 11 candidates in the fray - highest for any constituency in this poll. This tribal-reserved seat is dominated by the Kuki tribe, and went to polls on March 4 in the first phase.

""It is a crucial seat and we had ensured a tight security cover yet we found some malpractices and ordered a repoll,"" Manipur's Chief Electoral officer VK Dewangan told NDTV.

The repolling took place yesterday, but the BJP again filed a complaint against the Congress candidate for booth capturing and the EC after scrutiny ordered another repoll.

About 1,000 voters are voting for the third time today.

""People from remote areas have actively participated in the polls. The political parties are locked in a fierce battle in Saikul which has many heavyweight candidates this time,"" said local journalist Kaybie Chongloi from Kangpokpi.

The EC had directed that the polling was to be held in the Saikul police station and not in the polling booth that was allegedly 'rigged' twice.

The Manipur assembly election 2017 has been unique in many ways. From peaceful polling amid a four-month long economic blockade, the BJP's surge as a formidable opponent in this Congress stronghold to activist Irom Sharmila's foray into politics and a high voter turnout in the two-phased polls for the 60-member assembly, Manipur is experiencing an exciting moment.

The first phase recorded 86.5 per cent polling, followed by 88 per cent in the second phase. Repolling at 34 booths in eight constituencies of the first phase yesterday stood at 89 per cent.","imphal, manipur:"

the congress has been in power in the state for three straight terms. the poll of exit polls predicts 26 seats for the congress and 24 for the bjp in the 60-member assembly. a party needs to have 31 nseats to form the government.

the india-tv-c voter poll gives the bjp 25 to 31 seats, while predicting 17 to 23 seats for the ruling congress.

the india today-axis survey predicts 30 to 36 seats for the congress. the bjp, it says, will get between 16 and 22 seats.

chief minister ibobi singh has been worried about the bjp presence in the state. the bjp, which had failed to win a single seat five years ago in the 60-member manipur assembly, has proved to be a major concern for the congress, that has witnessed many of its leaders shifting loyalties to the bjp. many of the leaders who joined the party belong to the kuki tribe - traditionally a congress support base - who control the hill areas. also, ibobi singh's decision to bifurcate seven districts has only alienated the nagas.

The events would follow massive back to back road shows held by PM Modi and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi through the holy city today.

The BJP leaders said Mr Modi's road show today will cover a different and much wider area during which the party candidates would accompany him.

Yesterday, Mr Modi paid obeisance at the historic Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples as part of his mega road show.

The campaign led by Mr Modi in the city underlines the stake the BJP has in the Prime Minister's Lok Sabha constituency where it had won three of the five assembly seats in 2012. The Samajwadi Party had won the remaining two.

However, what is significant is that the SP and the Congress, both allies now but rivals five years back, had together polled more votes than the BJP in two of the three seats it had won.

With Mr Modi now representing Varanasi in the Lok Sabha, his party is doing all it can to put up a commanding performance.

A host of Union ministers and top BJP leaders led by Amit Shah have been camping here to lead the party's campaign for the last phase of polls.

Yes, if the state votes like it did five years ago in the assembly elections of 2012. No, if it votes the way it did in the 2014 general elections.

In 2012, Akhilesh Yadav led his party to victory in UP, winning 226 of the state's 403 assembly seats. The Samajwadi Party got 29 per cent of the votes. The Congress, with 14 per cent vote share, had won 38 seats. In quite a few seats the Congress was second.

If the two parties had fought that election together as they are now, they would've won 43 per cent of the vote share, with the Samajwadi Party winning 270 seats and the Congress 82. It would have meant 88 more seats with a combined total of 352 - a landslide win.

The additional seats would have come mostly at the cost of Mayawati's BSP. Her party, which had won 80 seats in 2012, would've won only 20 seats if the SP and Congress had been partners then.
The 2014 general election, however, was a complete contrast. The BJP, which had won only 47 seats with its 15 per cent vote share in 2012, rode a Modi wave to win 71 of UP's 80 parliamentary seats along with ally Apna Dal, equal to 337 assembly seats.
If the Samajwadi Party, which got 20 per cent votes for five Lok Sabha seats or 42 assembly seats, and the Congress - eight per cent votes for two Lok Sabha seats (15 assembly seats) - had been partners in 2014, they would've together won the equivalent of 85 assembly seats, denting the BJP's number by about only 27 seats only.

But it is the BJP that has the man who has ruled the state for the last 15 years worried.

In the crucial second phase, 22 constituencies will vote. Ten of these are in Thoubal district in the valley and considered Chief Minister Ibobi Singh's stronghold. The rest are in the tribal-dominated hills. Of these 22 seats, the Congress had won 14 and two other MLAs later joined it. Effectively, the ruling party is fighting to retain 16 seats tomorrow.

The BJP, which hopes to win its third state in the northeast after Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, did not win a single seat five years ago in the 60-member Manipur assembly. But most of the Congress' top leaders from the hill areas have switched to the BJP in the last six months. Most of them are from the Kuki tribe, traditionally a Congress support base.

                                The narrow streets of temple town Varanasi turned into a sea of saffron flags as Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his second roadshow in as many days in his parliamentary constituency.

The BJP is eyeing the 10 seats in the Thoubal district that has been three-time Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh's bastion for the last 15 years. Thoubal is also the most keenly watched seat in the assembly election where activist-turned-politician Irom Sharmila is taking on Mr Ibobi Singh.

The BJP is doing every bit to reach out to the minority voters, the Manipuri Muslims or Meitei Pangals. They constitute about 10 per cent of the state's 19 lakh voters. Of the 22 seats that go to polls in the second phase, Muslim votes are going to influence at least six constituencies in the Thoubal district.

""The Congress calls us communal, but we have an alliance with People's Democratic Party in Jammu and Kashmir. In the Christian-dominated Nagaland, we have an alliance with the ruling party. We never do politics of communities,"" BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav said while addressing a gathering in Lilong in Thoubal yesterday.

The BJP's sole Muslim candidate in Manipur is from Lilong. Nobody would have envisaged a BJP rally in Thoubal especially in the minority belt of Lilong in the early days. Clearly times have changed.

Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, on the other hand, asserts that the Congress has always promoted communal harmony in the northeastern state.

""We have ensured sharing of power with the minorities at the grass-root level,"" Ibobi Singh had told Muslim voters during several rallies. ","thoubal, manipur:"

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who has forged an alliance with ruling Samajwadi Party for the assembly elections, conducted rallies with chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in the city. BSP chief Mayawati, who has been out of power for 5 years, had also launched a high-octane campaign in this key constituency.

Uttar Pradesh Election Watch and Association For Democratic Reforms or ADR analysed over 500 candidates who are contesting in this phase.

"407","UP Elections 2017: Rivals To Get 'Electric Shock' After UP Poll Results: PM Narendra Modi","                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said BJP's rivals Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress will get ""electric shocks"" when the results of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are announced.

PM Modi's sharp riposte came in response to a remark by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who had asked him to touch an electric wire to see if current flows through it.

On the campaign trail, PM Modi has been attacking the Samajwadi Party government over ""poor"" power supply in the state and also controversially accused it of discrimination in its distribution along religious lines, a charge rubbished by the Chief Minister.

""On March 11, election results will give electric shock to SP, BSP and Congress,"" he said.

""Akhilesh has dared me to touch an electric wire to find out whether power is really there or not. His new friend Rahul Gandhi, during his 'khaat sabha' at Madihan in Mirzapur, however, had touched the wire and told his party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad that there was nothing to worry as there is no power in the line,"" PM Modi said.

""This is the acceptance of your new friend. Do I need touch the wires anymore? Akhilesh ji, now people have spread such a current that will give shocks to SP, BSP and Congress on March 11,"" he said.

Mr Gandhi had launched a 'khaat sabha' campaign, much before the Samajwadi Party and Congress got into an alliance for the state assembly election, where the Congress vice president would interact with the village folk seated on cots to understand their problems and find solutions. One 'khaat sabha' saw villagers run away with the cots after the meeting had ended.

PM Modi said people had run away with the cots as those belonged to them and they would now ensure the defeat of Congress.","mirzapur, uttar pradesh:"

The BJP, which is hoping to replicate its Assam success in its second northeastern state, has pitched Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its face. BJP president Amit Shah will also try to promote Brand Modi in Manipur. The question is, whether the party can best Congress' master strategist and three-time Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh.

Last week, during PM Modi's rally in Imphal, a group of educated but unemployed Manipuri youth heard promises of jobs on merit. They had come from Thoubal, 30 km from Imphal, the stronghold of the Chief Minister.

""I gave many interviews, but never got a job,"" said 37-year-old Joychandra Singh, who did his Masters in rural development. He voted for Ibobi Singh all his life, but now, he says it's time for 'poriborton' (change) for him.

During his rally last week, PM Modi made a jibe at Ibobi Singh and asked his audience, ""Have you ever heard of a 10 per cent chief minister? Anywhere? Manipur now need zero per cent CM."" The PM had over seven lakh educated yet unemployed youth of Manipur and 55,000 first-time voters on mind.

""We want good roads, better transportation, good hospitals all over Manipur. We want zero corruption and we hope that a change in the form of BJP is going to be good,"" said first-time voter, Neoren Singh.

In the last 15 years of Ibobi Singh's rule, schools in Manipur have always failed to complete their calendar year due to frequent shutdowns and blockades. The last week witnessed protests by youth and students asking PM Modi to make the details of the 2015 Framework Agreement public.

""The centre needs to give details of the framework agreement with Nagas, mere assurances will not do. We don't want to lose our land to the Nagas,"" said M Swamikumar Singh, student from Imphal.","imphal, manipur:"

Varanasi with 5 assembly seats votes on March 8 in last phase of UP polls
                                If the finishing line makes athletes run faster and feel nervous, politics during elections is no different. With the last phase of polls in Uttar Pradesh just four days away, each political outfit is pulling out all the stops to steal the show in India's most populous state. All of Friday, the entire BJP machinery in Varanasi being led by top ministers displayed a bad case of nerves. A top minister refused attempts by a media crew to get a sound bite by saying, ""Please excuse me. Varanasi may vote on March 8 but our exam is on March 4. PM Modi is coming to Varanasi. He will not just address the rally and visit some temple. He is coming to his constituency and will visit the Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples. It's a visit which will send not a signal but signals.""

Bhupinder Yadav, the BJP general secretary who has been camping here for a week till all the votes come home on March 8, added to the drama with a cryptic comment that barely gave anything away. ""We are not saying that it will be a show of strength tomorrow. We are saying PM is coming for a darshan of voters of Varanasi and a darshan on Baba Vishwanath at Kashi temple,"" he said.

The BJP cadres here are agog - will the PM simply drive down from the landing zone in the Lanka area to Kashi and Bhairon temple and then for the second time for a rally at Town Hall ground? Or will he do something which will send a signal?

""We don't know what the Prime Minister plans. He is expected to travel in a cavalcade to the Kashi temple and then for rally. But will he emerge from the car - or will he turn it into a road show?"" wondered one party worker.

The district administration officials who are preparing for a day-long nightmare with PM's visit during the day say they have no request for a roadshow.

Yogeshwar Mishra, district magistrate of Varanasi, said, ""The programme of the Prime Minister includes a cavalcade drive. There is no information about any kind of roadshow.""

The BJP, which has a lot at stake in the last two phases of polling, had moved its war room to Varanasi several days ago entrusting Union Ministers and senior leaders with the task of strengthening the campaign with the Prime Minister in the front.

Top BJP leaders were deputed to work out and rehearse each element of the Prime Minister's visit. Power Minister Piyush Goyal visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple to check arrangements. The SPG or Special Protection Group and local police carried out a detailed drill. All the vehicles which will be part of the PM's cavalcade went over the route. At the temples, the parking formation as per guidelines was also carried out. Every building along the PM's route will get rooftop security men. And public buildings would be sanitised.

in the run-up to the elections, all political parties in their campaigns mainly focused on the continuing economic blockade imposed by the united naga council and the state government's inability to break it. this invited corruption cases against some leaders in the state too. bjp leaders also levelled corruption charges against the congress government and its inability to provide basic amenities to the people of the state, particularly the supply of potable water. the congress countered, saying the government during its 15-year rule implemented several development projects and improved the power supply.

according to data provided by association for democratic reforms (adr), national parties bharatiya janata party and congress have fielded most number of candidates with criminal cases slapped against them. figures reveal that both parties have 21 candidates with criminal record. the adr research team analysed 38 independent candidates in manipur and found that none of the leaders had declared a criminal case against them.

""The BJP has become the Number One party of the baagi and daagi candidates... this time they have not given tickets to people of their own cadre but to those who joined them after leaving other parties... tickets were given to rebels and with those having criminal antecedents,"" she told an election rally in Jaunpur.

""Akhileshji ke pita Mulayam Singh ney purey jivan Congress ka virodh kiya par unhone pita ki kamaiee par paani pher diya (Mulayam opposed Congress all his life but Akhilesh ruined his father's work),"" Mr Singh said at an election meeting in Rasra.

Seeking a response on development works, he claimed all of the Chief Minister's 'kaam' is speaking only in newspapers and TV and none of it is seen on the ground.

On Rahul Gandhi, the Union Minister said four months ago, the Congress leader had held meetings on 'khats' (cots), which are normally used for sleeping and not to hold meetings. Lamenting the political atmosphere in the state, Mr Singh said parties which talked about eradicating poverty and improving the lot of the poor were today honouring money over the hard work of people.

Assembly segments of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency of firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, and Mau, where jailed gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari is in fray, also figure in this sixth and penultimate phase of polling.

The campaigning saw BJP state president KP Maurya likening rivals SP, Congress and BSP to different types of venomous ""snakes"" and ""social cancer"" and urging people to eliminate them by voting for the BJP.

 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav countered BJP saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conceded defeat in the polls by talking about a hung house.

While mustering votes for BJP, PM Modi sought to prove wrong the prophets of doom after demonetisation saying the latest GDP data showed note-ban did not affect growth rate but rather improved it.

""Hardwork, in fact, is much more powerful than Harvard,"" he said in an apparent dig at economists.

The Prime Minister was addressing public rallies in eastern UP, where the last two rounds of assembly elections will be held in the next few days.

""Akhilesh Yadav says his work speaks for itself... the UP government website admits life in UP is short and uncertain and that in this respect UP resembles Saharan Africa,"" the Prime Minister said. He wagered that, ""UP officers will face action as soon as I finish my speech.""

PM Modi has dug deep into the official website of the UP government to unearth tragic figures that are perfunctorily featured in a section on the state's economy. The ""short and uncertain"" reference is under health, where the state government says that women on an average live less than 55 years in UP and that the mortality rate for children under five years is a high 141 in every thousand. It makes the comparison to Saharan Africa and admits that ""If a girl is born in Kerala she can expect to live 20 years longer than if she is born in Uttar Pradesh.""

The UP government also says on its website, ""Almost all social indicators of the state show that the state stands on 13th or 14th position among the sixteen major states. Bihar and in some cases Orissa, are the only two states which lag behind UP in terms of social development indicators like medical facilities, teacher-pupil ratio in primary schools, birth rate, death rate, infant mortality rate, literacy, per capita income, electrification of villages, per capita power consumption etc.

The Prime Minister has in his election speeches lambasted the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party, who have ruled UP by turns in the last 15 years, for what he calls a total neglect of the development of the state and its people. The BJP, PM Modi said in Maharajgunj near Gorakhpur today, wants to work for the people of UP. ""When you look at India's map, you might have seen that when it comes to India and its development, it has to be holistic. Development has to be well-rounded.""

He accused the Akhilesh Yadav government of not spending central funds on development. ""1.5 crore people in UP don't have houses. Our government wanted the list of homeless people from the UP government but didn't get the list,"" the Prime Minister said, adding, ""This kind of government must be defeated.""

The BJP, the Prime Minister said, ""is leading till the 5th phase and the 6th and 7th phase will be bonus from you all."" The question, he said, was not who would form government, ""but whether the BJP will win a two-thirds majority or a three-fourths majority.

Addressing the 'Varanasi Vyapari Sammelan' (traders meet), he hailed the Central government's demonetisation policy and said the move had won the confidence of many people.

""The demonetisation scheme was in the best interest of the countrymen. People residing in rural areas, who were once not our voters, voted for us this time due to this great step.

Our party courageously took the stand on demonetisation, which will make a positive impact on the economy of the country,"" he said.

""The world has accepted that India's economy is the fastest growing economy,"" he said.

Commenting on the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the senior BJP leader said, ""BJP is going to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh with full majority like it did at the Centre after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.""

He also hit out at the Opposition for targeting BJP for not having a chief ministerial face for the UP assembly elections.

Mr Jaitley pointed out that the electorate had chosen Narendra Modi, long before he was declared the Prime Minister nominee of BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

""During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the electorate of this country accepted Modiji first, afterwards our Bharatiya Janata party (workers) accepted him and at the end, our parliamentary board nominated him, and we even won the elections,"" he maintained.

""After 1984, it was for the first time that a political party got a clear majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls,"" he said, adding that history will be repeated in the UP elections.

Hitting out at the rival Congress, Mr Jaitley said the party was reduced to winning only 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as it ""only worked for its personal benefit, not for the nation.""

""Now BJP has become the pan India party,"" he asserted.

Mr Jaitley also attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for ""distributing tickets to criminal candidates, paving way for 'Goondaraj' (hooliganism) and doing caste-based politics.""

The election is billed as a major test for the Okram Ibobi Singh-led Congress government in the state which has been in power for the last 15 years.

In the first phase, 38 Assembly seats out of 60, covering both the Imphal valley and the hills, will go to the polls.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh were the star campaigners in the first phase, all of whom addressed multiple rallies.

During campaigning, there were bitter exchanges between the Congress and the BJP over the ongoing economic blockade in the state and the Naga Peace Accord.

 The Congress accused the BJP of ""compromising with the
territorial integrity"" of Manipur, an allegation the saffron
party has vociferously denied.

The Naga Peace Accord, also called the ""framework agreement"", was signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the Centre in August, 2015.

The state has been saddled with an indefinite economic blockade since November 1, 2016, imposed by the United Naga Council, causing immense hardship to the people as the supply of essential commodities, especially fuel, in the land-locked state has choked.

The blockade has been imposed on Manipur's ""lifelines"" -- national highways 2 and 37, in protest against the state government's decision to carve out seven new districts from the existing ones.

The blockade has become a major poll plank in the north-eastern state.

The second and final phase of the Assembly polls is scheduled on March 8 and the results will be declared on March 11.","imphal:"

This has been a hectic poll season for Manipur with many star campaigners addressing multiple rallies. There were bitter exchanges between the Congress and the BJP over the ongoing economic blockade in the state and the Naga Peace Accord.

In the last 15 years of Ibobi Singh's rule, the state has seen many twists and turns. Frequent shutdowns and blockades have put the economic growth in the slow lane. The last week witnessed protests by youth and students asking PM Modi to make the details of the 2015 Framework Agreement public. ","imphal, manipur:"

Addressing the 'Varanasi Vyapari Sammelan' (traders meet) in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency yesterday, he added that history will be created in the UP elections.

""After 1984, it was for the first time that a political party got a clear majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls,"" the senior leader said.

He also hailed the centre's demonetization policy and said the move had won the confidence of many people.

""The demonetisation scheme was in the best interest of the countrymen. People residing in rural areas, who were once not our voters, voted for us this time due to this great step. Our party courageously took the stand on demonetisation, which will make a positive impact on the economy of the country,"" Mr Jaitley said.

""The world has accepted that India's economy is the fastest growing economy,"" he added.

Commenting on the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the senior BJP leader said, ""BJP is going to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh with full majority like it did at the Centre after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.""

Mr Jaitley also hit out at the opposition for targeting BJP for not having a chief ministerial face for the UP assembly elections. Mr Jaitley pointed out that the electorate had chosen Mr Modi, long before he was declared the Prime Minister nominee of BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

""During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the electorate of this country accepted Modiji first, afterwards our Bharatiya Janata Party (workers) accepted him and at the end, our parliamentary board nominated him, and we even won the elections,"" he maintained.","varanasi:"

"430","A Forgotten Village In Rahul Gandhi's Amethi Boycotts Election In Anger","                             In Amethi, a VIP constituency courtesy Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who represents it in Parliament, the entire village of Parsauli in Uttar Pradesh did not vote in the assembly elections on Monday. They were protesting against the main road to the village not being repaired for decades.

All 649 voters in Parsauli, 339 men and 310 women boycotted the election in the fifth of seven rounds of polling. Polling booth number 120 saw not a single vote cast, officials said.

The villagers say they are bewildered at having been stricken off the map by their representatives. Parsauli is only three km away from Amethi town on the Amethi-Durgapur highway, but has had no proper road linking it for many years.

Two powerful politicians represent it - while Mr Gandhi is the member of parliament, the legislator is Gayatri Prajapati, an influential minister in the Samajwadi Party of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

KN Sharma, a retired station master of the Indian Railways, who lives in Parsauli, told news agency Press Trust of India that the road that connects the village with the highway was constructed when the Congress' Sanjay Gandhi was the MP from Amethi.

There has been no attempt to repair it since and there is simply no road left. Sanjay Gandhi, Rahul's uncle, died 37 years ago in 1980.

The BJP has accused Rahul Gandhi of neglecting Amethi, which has been a Gandhi family stronghold for years. The Gandhis - including party chief Sonia Gandhi who is Rahul's mother - have accused the BJP-led central government of punishing voters in Amethi and adjoining Rae Bareli by withholding the benefits of central schemes from them.

In the national election in 2014, only two constituencies out of UP's 80 had voted in Congress MPs - Amethi and Rae Bareli elected Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The BJP won 72 seats and Akhilesh Yadav's party had won 5.

For the UP assembly elections the Congress has partnered with the Samajwadi Party but both parties fielded candidates in the Amethi assembly seat after the Congress' Ameeta Singh insisted on contesting.

The BJP turned it into an even more high profile contest, fielding Garima Singh as its candidate. Garima Singh is the ex-wife of Sanjay Singh, locally known as the Raja or King of Amethi. Ameeta Singh is married to him now.

The Samajwadi Party has fielded its sitting legislator Mr Prajapati, against whom a first information report or FIR was registered last week in a rape case.","amethi, uttar pradesh:"

He also blamed Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for letting absconding minister and rape-accused Gayatri Prajapati letting go scot-free, calling it a worst example of poor law and order. Asked if the results will be seen as people's response to the PM Narendra Modi government's work, he said they would put their stamp of approval on its two-and-a-half-year tenure in these elections.

""The BJP has already won a majority of seats in the state assembly in the first five phases of the polls. In the next two, people will push our tally to two-thirds mark. I can say with confidence that we will get two-thirds seats,"" he said.

Mr Shah rejected the suggestion of an intensive campaign by Prime Minister Modi in Varanasi and neighbouring places and the fact that the top party brass has been camping here for days were a sign of nervousness in the saffron camp.

Wherever elections have taken place in the earlier phases, the party and its leaders have focused on campaigning and it is natural that they are in Varanasi now as it goes to the polls in the last phase, he said.

The state is seeing a similar wave in the BJP's support that was witnessed during the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 when it won 71 of the 80 seats, he claimed. Responding to Mr Yadav's barb at the BJP over its 'achhe din' (good days) claim for the country, he said, ""The 'achhe din' of Uttar Pradesh will begin from 1 P M on March 11 when the counting of votes will occur and the BJP will emerge victorious.""","varanasi:"

Over the next few days, political parties plan to carpet bomb Varanasi and adjoining areas and Saturday, March 4, will be a logistics nightmare for the local administration. PM Modi will campaign that day in his constituency while another part of UP votes, as will the Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi team and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati.

The BJP, which hopes to replicate its sweep of UP in the 2014 national elections, has moved its entire brass to eastern UP, where it has been forced to counter a rebellion by supporters of powerful local leader and priest Yogi Adityanath. They are upset that he has not been named the party's presumptive chief minister. The UP elections are seen as a bellwether for the next general elections in 2019.

"437","UP Elections 2017: What's In A Name? In Harijanpur, Opinion Is Divided","                             If caste equations play a dominant role in Uttar Pradesh politics, on the ground, its reflection can be seen in villages like Harijanpur. Blatantly named after castes or groupings of their residents, such villages can be found in every corner of the state. Harijanpur -- 20 km on an extremely bad road from Chitrakoot's Manikpur block and home to 530 Dalit voters -- is all set for Thursday's vote, in which they have been promised much, but not a change of name.

For villagers like Kalavati, this is the ultimate stamp of shame. ""Ghrina aati hai,"" said the 60-year-old widow, seated in a neighbour's house. The words loosely translate to feeling disgusted with the name of her village. Kalavati says she wants an immediate change - involving the removal of the word ""Harijan"".

Once popularised by Mahatma Gandhi in his fight against untouchability, the word is now considered derogatory. ""I don't like this name. If it got changed, I could go into society with more dignity,"" she said.

Sitting nearby, 50-year-old farmer Ramakant chips in: ""Earlier, we raised this name change demand and this was converted into a Ambedkar gram in Mayawati's tenure. That scheme lasted for three years and that's the only time we saw any development,"" he says.

At the village well, scores of women can be seen with a list of demands usual in this part of the country which is drought hit and impoverished. Their three key demands are a decent road, irrigation for crops and employment.

Further ahead in the village, we meet Ashish and Arjun, both in their early 20s, who say forget names, the biggest issue here is migration. Ashish has just returned from a factory in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar, Arjun from Jaipur. Local-level employment, they say, is the big issue. Not the name of the village.

""When I go out, I just say I'm from Chitrakoot. That's how we are identified anyway,"" says Arjun. ""I think the impact of caste is coming down in our society,"" adds Ashish.

Asked about the only political presence in the village -- a Mayawati sticker pasted outside a thatched hut - he said, ""We will vote for the person who works and does some good for us"".","harijanpur village, chitrakoot:"
"438","UP Polls 2017: Prannoy Roy On Why 'New Voters' Of 2014 Are Essential For BJP","                             India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh is more than halfway through the 2017 Assembly Elections - seen as the bellwether for the general elections two years later. The critical question for the election is whether the BJP - which swept the state in the 2014 general elections - will be able to repeat the success or if the Samajwadi Party - which has tied up this year with the Congress - be able to script a sequel to its 2012 state poll landslide. As both the top ambassadors for the election - Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - claim to be working towards moulding the election narrative towards development, it remains to be seen how much of the politics in the battleground state is still influenced by religion and caste. NDTV's Prannoy Roy and election experts analyse what it will take for the parties to win the prized battle in the state seen as most critical to India's political discourse.

Demonetisation or the central government's move to ban large notes in a bid to curb corruption and tax evasion, a real pain a few months ago, has eased, says senior journalist Shekhar Gupta. But as much as people vote on economic issues, caste remains an undeniably key factor in UP elections.

Here's a look at how different castes voted in 2014 Lok Sabha and 2012 Assembly elections:


Caste still influences political allegiances in Uttar Pradesh, shows a ground survey in the state. But the other factor that affects which party gets the mandate is the age of the voter.

Akhilesh Yadav who swept the 2012 election will need to rely greatly on the young vote once again if he is to make a return. The question is, will the youth factor work for Akhilesh Yadav?


But for the BJP, it will be 'new voters' and a focus on vote banks that will be key to win the 2017 Assembly Elections:


On the campaign trail, NDTV spoke to BJP's Rajnath Singh - one of the party's tallest leaders in the state.

Majority in the 403-member UP assembly is 202 seats.

In 2012, when the Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav rode a wave to victory, his party had needed far less, 29 per cent vote share, to win 226 seats. Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party or BSP with 26 per cent votes could win just 80 seats. In many seats that the Samajwadi Party had won, the difference between its candidate and the number 2, mostly the BSP candidate, was less than 1 per cent.

But that year, the two regional giants were the primary actors in UP, with national parties the BJP and the Congress coming in a distant third and fourth.

Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane's name emerged in a video in which his former driver claims to have witnessed the BJP leader shooting dead a man. The driver was detained by police after the video went viral on social media.

""Witness Pandurang Adarkar who is from Kolhapur in Maharashtra has been detained. He has confessed to being witness to the murder of one Shanu Gaonkar, who is missing since 2006,"" inspector Dipak Pednekar was quoted by news agency PTI.

In the video that has gone viral, Mr Adarkar purportedly claimed he was witness to Mr Rane shooting Mr Gaonkar dead in Sattari tehsil of Goa in 2006 to avenge the killing of his brother Prithviraj Rane.

 Prithviraj Rane was murdered at Saleli village of Sattari tehsil in 2005.

Preliminary inquiry had begun under the supervision of Superintendent of Police Karthik Kashyap, the inspector told PTI.

Police have not arrested anyone in connection with the case, but claim that the statements of all the people named by Mr Adarkar would be recorded. The police officer, however, ruled out questioning Mr Rane at this juncture.

Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane has not responded to the allegation levelled against him.

Mr Rane contested against Congress' Pratapsinh Rane from Poriem constituency during the assembly elections held earlier this month. A high voter turnout of over 83 per cent was recorded in the Assembly polls in Goa, which were held on February 4. The ruling BJP is engaged in a fierce fight with the Opposition Congress, AAP and an alliance of MGP, Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch for the 40-member House.

""BJP says 'Ka' stands for Congress. Your Akhilesh bhaiyya says 'Ka' (in Hindi) stands for Computer, 'Sa' stands for smartphone, through which you can get all the information about the policies of the government and 'B' stands for 'bachche' (children),"" Dimple, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said at an election rally amid loud applause.

The ruling Samajwadi Party has a scheme to distribute laptops to meritorious students and promised to give smartphones if it returns to power in the state.

Mr Shah at a rally last week at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur had used the 'KASAB' acronym to describe 'Ka' for Congress, 'Sa' for SP and 'B' for BSP.

Mr Shah coined the acronym matching the name of terrorist Ajmal Kasab - one of the perpetrators of 26/11 Mumbai attack.

Akhilesh had earlier hit out at the BJP chief for his ""Kasab"" barb, saying ""Ka"" actually stood for ""kabutar"" (pigeon), while BSP supremo Mayawati had said, ""There cannot be a bigger Kasab than him"" and dubbed Shah a ""terrorist"".

Dimple said SP would give 35 per cent reservation to women, and pregnant women would get foodgrains delivered at their doorstep.

""If SP is voted to power, we will do away with the age-limit for women in Class-III and IV government jobs,"" she said.

The Kannauj MP also said that for every gas stove purchased, her party would give a pressure cooker.

If you want to be a teacher - pay a certain amount; same for being a cop or a chef at a minister's house. How is this allowed to go on?The Congress in Manipur does not want to light the bulbs in your house. They think if there's electricity, the people will buy TVs which will give news of the money sent to the state and not spent on its people.Even when the Centre gives them electricity, they have no intention to develop the state.Youth from Manipur and northeast have been working to safeguard Delhi. This is an example of their strength. I have urged to have northeastern people recruited in the security forces to show the country their strength.When, at 8 pm on November 8, I demonetised 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, Congress leaders were startled. They couldn't fathom the consequences.The money that they have looted, I will take it back and use it for the development of the people.These people don't care about cultures in India or the nation but just their seats.People talk about the accord with the Nagas. I want to ask the state government, were you sleeping for 1.5 years? We had informed about the accord with all details a year and a half ago. Now when the elections have been announced, they are spreading rallies.I, standing on the holy land of Manipur, promise you that there's not even one word in any accord which is against the interests of Manipuris.Isn't it the state government's responsibility to provide essential commodities such as sugar and salt, medicines and pulses?Still there are protests on the streets. People don't have grains. What kind of a government is that?Results of polls will be announced on March 11. The country will celebrate Holi on March 13. I promise you I will not let any blockade stop the celebration.Why shouldn't the blockades be removed? Why shouldn't there be a police case against rioters? I urge the people to remove the blockade today and we will help them to resolve all issues.You (Congress) had your way in Manipur because your government was in Delhi. Now you will have to give account of everything because there's Modi sitting in Delhi now.Manipur has done well in sports. Manipur is strong. We sent money for sports facilities but the chief minister here..No chief minister is talked about in percentage. What's this 10 per cent I asked the people of Manipur? They told me Modi ji you are honest; you won't understand this easily.Manipur now needs a zero per cent CM.We want to make Manipur an organic state. We want to give 24-hour electricity to all households. Congress will not let this happen. The people of Manipur will be made to live in darkness. We have to change this.They (Congress) wants vote for their 10 per cent commission. We want vote for 100 per cent development.We want to give: Kissano ko Sichai, Bachchon ko Parhai, Naujavanon ko Kamai, Aur burhon ko Davai. (Irrigation for farmers, education for children, employment for youth and medicines for the old)We took 800 crucial medicines and made them cheaper, from 3,000 to 300 and from 80 to 12 rupees. Didn't the people of lower economic strata benefit?When someone has a pain in chest, they rush to the doctor. The doctor tells them they need a stent. They give you two choices: one that costs 45,000 rupees and will give you up to six years of life, or the other which costs 1,30,000 will stay for a lifetime. So the poor are forced to choose. How can poor get 1 lakh plus?I called the manufacturers to reduce the cost of these stents to Rs 7,000 from 45,000 and Rs 25,000 from 1,30,000.Everything has rates - money is needed to get a job, needed to get a college seat.Son tells his mother that I need 2 lakh to get a degree which will get me a job. Mother says I will mortgage the house, the jewellery.Three babus for the interview and ask questions as a formality. They take money to give jobs. I have finished this process. Jobs for grade 3 and grade 4 will now be given on merit basis.They said we will give 12 subsidised cylinders from nine and it was an issue. We did our research and figured that people were black marketing.We gave free gas connections to people and saved the old mothers from the smoke of 400 cigarettes coming out from wood burning chulhas.This should be the aim of development. To save the poor and first give them the basics.Give BJP a chance for 5 years.","imphal:"

""until uttar pradesh gets rid of k-a-s-a-b, there will be no development in the state. ka (in hindi) is for congress, sa for samajwadi party and ba for bsp,"" mr shah said in chauri chaura, a historic town in uttar pradesh. he did not even finish the last bit, letting the crowd guess it.

ajmal kasab, the only among the pakistani attackers caught after the 2008 mumbai terror attack, was hanged in 2012.

""until kasab is laid to rest, development and prosperity will continue to elude up,"" mr shah said.

reacting to the bjp chief's dig, congress spokesperson abhishek mau singhvi said, ""there is a need to end acronyms... bjp's repulsive thinking has been brought out. it shows the party's communal mindset.""

earlier this month, prime minister narendra modi came up with scam while addressing his first rally in uttar pradesh. ""scam is samajwadi, congress, akhilesh and mayawati,"" he said, drawing a roar of approval from the crowd.

uttar pradesh chief minister akhilesh yadav made another attempt - ""save country from amit shah and modi.""

this week, pm modi described mayawati's bsp or bahujan samaj party as ""behenji sampatti (property) party"".

An FIR has been filed against him in this regard.

Inspector in-charge of the Civil Lines police station Arun Kumar Tyagi said the FIR was filed upon the complaint of Sector Magistrate Sunil Kumar Singh.

The FIR was followed up by an inquiry ordered by District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar into allegations of Mr Maurya wearing the party sticker on the pocket of his jacket the day he came to cast his vote at a polling booth, set up on the premises of a college in the city on February 23.

Responding to queries from reporters yesterday, Mr Maurya said, ""I did not intentionally go to the polling booth wearing the party sticker. I wear the sticker on my front pocket always and it has become a habit.
""I just forgot to take it off while going inside. I would, however, respect any action taken by the EC in this regard.""

A section of the Representation of the People Act forbids any person to exhibit any notice or sign relating to the election on the day of polling within a distance of 100m of the polling station. Contravention of any of the provisions of the section, which place a number of other restrictions enforceable on polling days, is punishable with fine.

Far from being dismissive of her, he says, he too began his political career as an independent. But Irom Sharmila wants to be the Chief Minister now.

""I want to be Chief Minister of Manipur and bring real democracy and real true relationship between people and ruler,"" said Irom Sharmila on her campaign trail. She is single minded. But her party- Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) - has fielded candidates in only three out of 60 seats. So the math doesn't add up. And her meetings in people's courtyards or at street corners are thinly attended.

Congress rallies are, in contrast, packed. At an inauguration of some Congress candidates, where Ibobi Singh was present, the turnout was huge. Reversed parallels of David versus Goliath are hard to miss.

Mr Ibobi Singh, however, is diplomatic. Even his voters respect Irom Sharmila for her valiant fight against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA in the state. ""Everybody has the right to contest an election. She is my sister, Irom Sharmila. She is most welcome. Let the people decide,"" said Ibobi Singh.

But voters are divided, and sharply. One of them said he had no idea who she was. ""I have heard her name but I have never seen her or heard people talking about her,"" a young man said. Another man, however, is sure Irom Sharmila will win. ""Ibobi will lose,"" he says.

Even Irom Sharmila's own party PRJA is talking of moral victory and the next polls. ""She has struggled campaigning in Thoubal for various reasons. But this is just our first foray into electoral politics. Five years later, I am quite confident we are going to be a much larger party,"" Erendro Leichombam, convenor and candidate of the party said.

A Manipuri tradition is for voters to bring gifts to candidates - rice, vegetables and such. These gifts are pouring in at Congress meetings. Irom Sharmila may not care for this feudal tradition of gifts but she needs votes. She is cycling on. But the ride seems uphill.

Manipur will vote in two phases on March 4 and 8. The counting of votes will take place on March 11.","thoubal:"

The 44-year-old, however, distanced itself from the rebel outfit. ""The outfit will not damage the BJP's prospects,"" he asserted. ""I am not a candidate. I want a BJP worker to become Chief Minister.""

Yogi Adityanath, a big crowd-puller for the BJP in eastern Uttar Pradesh, has been assigned a chopper to zip across the state to campaign as the party tries to win back the politically vital state after 15 years.","highlightsbjp mp yogi adityanath represents uttar pradesh's gorakhpur constituency

the pm had said at a rally, ""there should be no discrimination. if there is land given for kabristan (graveyards), there must be provisions for shamshaanghat (crematoriums). electricity must be provided on ramzan and diwali. if there is power for holi, it must be available for eid.""

the all india power engineers association however has clarified that on eid last year, 13,500 mw of electricity was generated, and that on the 4 auspicious days of diwali, the figure was 15,400 mw per day, suggesting the absence of bias.

to this, the yogi told this interviewer to ""stop quoting data"". what counts, he said, is public opinion.

""people's anger is evidence. when people come on the streets, no evidence is necessary,"" he insisted.

the saffron-robed lawmaker also asserted, somewhat bizzarely, that he believed that going by the demographics, power supply on diwali should be ""four times more"" than on eid.

yogi adityanath said he ""agreed with the prime minister that sp vikas (development) is limited to graveyards"".

the bjp has alleged that rs 1,300 crores were allotted for a graveyard scheme compared to rs 627 crores for crematoriums.

asked whether the prime minister should have laboured a point that involves a fraction of the state's budget of rs 3.46 lakh crores, the firebrand politician said, ""the budget should be spent according to the population. it may be a small matter for you""

he then pivoted, making it a larger problem of the misuse, or lack of use, of the state's funds. ""if it is a fraction of the budget, where did the rest of the money go?"", he asked. "

20-year-old Arvind Varma has been frequenting the labour chowk each day for the last 15 years in search of daily jobs that fetch him around Rs 300 a day.

""There are water problems, no roads and no accountability in Bundelkhand. As labour, it would mean literally walking in to the hands of exploitation,"" says Mr Varma, who now works as a cook at night and a manual labourer by day.

 Drought and declining agriculture forced him and his family to migrate from Jhansi to the outskirts of Dadri nearly 20 years ago, a time when Bundelkhand was severely drought-ridden and one of the poorest regions in the country.

For 35-year-old Pappu, a former-farmer from a neighbouring village in Jhansi who has five family-members to feed by himself, even migration seems to have offered little.

""We get Rs 350 here; in Bundelkhand I would make Rs 150. I am a farmer, so manual work is all I can do. I have heard in the elections some party is promising to cancel all farmersâ debts in Bundelkhand, is that true,"" he asks.

Like Arvind and Pappu, nearly 1,000 Bundelkhandis show up at the Greater Noida labour chowk daily, some travelling for six to seven hours from the heart of UP every day.""

If we donât have anything to eat, what else will we do? I have come today and will go back tomorrow to cast my vote,â says 47-year-old Bhanwri Devi, from Mahoba. âBut what is the point? They make us vote and then smother our faces,"" she adds.

Inder Prakash from Chitrakoot adds, ""There is no employment even here. After the note-ban, we canât even get our wages. So much for political promises.""

Last year alone drought conditions in Bundelkhand forced nearly 18 lakh people to migrate to Delhi and its neighbouring areas. According to some estimates, nearly 10 per cent of Bundelkhandâs population migrated at that time.","greater noida:"

The campaigning will come to a close at 5 pm for the fifth phase, polling for which will take place on February 27, Office of UP Chief Electoral Officer said in Lucknow today.

The districts going to polls in this phase are Balrampur, Gonda, Faizabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Bahraich, Shravasti, Siddharth Nagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Amethi, and Sultanpur.

Due to death of Samajwadi Party candidate Chandrashekhar Kanaujia in Alapur (Ambedkar Nagar), the EC has announced fresh date of voting in this constituency on March 9.

The ruling Samajwadi Party had won 37 seats out of 52 (total seats in this phase including Alapur) in 2012 Assembly polls while BJP and Congress won five seats each, BSP had won three while Peace party won two seats.

Shravasti, Balrampur, Sultanpur and Ambedkar Nagar had emerged as stronghold of Samajwadi Party with the party winning all the seats there.

In all 608 candidates are in the fray in this phase with maximum of 24 candidates in Amethi and minimum of six each in Kapilvastu and Etwa seats of Siddharth Nagar district.

Prominent contestants in this phase include controversial minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati (SP), who will be facing Amita Singh (Congress) and Garima Singh (BJP) in Amethi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Rahul Gandhi.

Ms Amita is the wife of Congress leader Sanjay Singh, while Ms Garima is his estranged better half.

1.84 crore voters, including 96 lakh women, will also decide the fate of ministers Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh from Tarabganj (Gonda), Tej Narain Pandey alias Pawan Pandey from Ayodhya and BSP state president Ram Achal Rajbhar from Akbarpur in this phase.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati were among the host of leaders who made a beeline to backward and water-scarce Bundelkhand region, which also figures in phase-IV of polling.

Other districts going to polls in the fourth phase are Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur.

During the highly surcharged campaigning, PM Modi repeatedly targeted the SP-Congress alliance and the BSP for corruption in their regime.

""SCAM stands for SP, Congress, Mr Akhilesh and Ms Mayawati,"" was PM Modi's refrain when he appealed to the voters of Bundelkhand to get rid of them.

As the prime minister termed BSP as ""Behenji Sampatti Party"", Ms Mayawati in her instant retort said the initials of Narendra Damodardas Modi stood for ""Mr. Negative Dalit Man"", escalating political temperature with such tit-for-tat barbs.

""Narendra Damodardas Modi means Mr. Negative Dalit Man, he is anti-dalit...this negative dalit man does not like that common people give small contributions in running the BSP movement which is also run through donations,"" an irked Ms Mayawati said.

Amid the verbal free-for-all, Mr Akhilesh referred to an advertisement of the tourism department of Gujarat, where PM Modi was Chief Minister before assuming the office of prime minister.

But PRJA has already notched up one small victory over the BJP, and its face for Manipur polls - Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The BJP - that was keen its star campaigner PM Modi holds his election rally at the historic Kangla Fort complex perhaps as a mark of symbolism in politics - has chucked its plan. Kangla Fort wasn't just home to the kings of Manipur, but is also seen as a sacred place in the Manipuri society.

PRJA - that had launched a campaign against using the fort for PM Modi's political rally - had also complained to the Election Commission. The ruling Congress too soon joined the chorus against the location for the PM's rally.

""We analysed (the situation) and felt that we must have a bigger venue. Thus we shifted. First we thought of having it in Kangla though,"" Manipur BJP spokesperson RK Sivachandra told NDTV.

He said the venue for the rally - the only one that the PM would address before the first phase of polling on March 4 - would be a few kilometres away at Langjing Achouba ground, near CRPF Camp in Imphal. The PM is expected to address a second public meeting before the second phase of polling on March 8.

PRJA considers the change of venue a moral victory.

In Manipur, the Congress has been in power for the exact same period. But the similarity ends there. While in Assam, the BJP united all possible allies to boost its prospects, in Manipur, everyone is singing ""Ekla Chalo Re (Go it alone)"".

The BJP's ally NPP, or the National People's Party of former Speaker Purno Sangma, is contesting 21 of the state's 60 seats. In many, it will hurt the BJP. ""We are a part of the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) but in every state, regional parties have their own aspirations and ideas,"" said Vivek Raj Wangkhem, the chief of the party.

While the Naga Peoples' Front (NPF) is also the BJP's friend at the Centre and in Nagaland, it is not in Manipur. The front is contesting 15 seats and in more than seven, it is a straight contest with the BJP.

""In Manipur, BJP and NPF have a lot of difference in ideology,"" said Hinreikhui Kashung, General Secretary of NPF.

To appease the Naga party, the BJP cannot afford to offend the majority Meitei community in Manipur.

""The NPF in its constitution has a paragraph where it states that it promotes the idea that contiguous Naga-inhabited areas in the northeast should be integrated into one administration. This is totally not acceptable to Manipuri people, so partnering with the NPF is not possible here,"" N Biren Singh, senior BJP spokesperson in Manipur told NDTV.

The Congress suspects that the BJP and its allies NPP and NPF have an understanding in the 20 seats in Manipur's hills, where it is weak.

He was inducted into the Union Cabinet as defence minister in 2014
BJP staked claim to form government with the support of regional allies
                                Manohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa Chief Minister for the fourth time tomorrow. He declared today that he has resigned from PM Narendra Modi's council of ministers to go back to Goa as its Chief Minister. The incumbent BJP with 13 seats claims to have support of eight other legislators needed to cross the magic mark. Mr Parrikar will have to prove his majority in the assembly within 15 days of swearing in. He will also have to get elected to the state legislature within six months.

For most of the 28 months that he has been the country's Defence Minister, Mr Parrikar has often been called Goa's super chief minister, a reflection of the IIT-Bombay graduate's keen interest in the politics of the state.

Mr Parrikar, 61, had been Chief Minister for a little over two years in his third stint in that post, when he was pulled out of Goa in late 2014 to join PM Modi's cabinet.

Mr Parrikar together with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari held a long meeting on Sunday evening where the BJP efficiently collected the additional seven seats it needs from regional parties. Mr Parrikar then met with Governor Mridula Sinha to stake claim and was invited to form the government.

The BJP staked claim to form government despite placing second to the Congress which has won the most -17- but not enough to form the government - the target is 21.

The BJP legislators in Goa met on Sunday morning and unanimously said they want Mr Parrikar to head their government. The party's former ally the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP with three seats offered their support to the BJP on condition that Mr Parrikar will head the government.

Another regional party Goa Forward, which also won three seats, has provided its support in writing at the meeting on Sunday evening.

There are three independents who have been elected two of whom have promised support to the BJP, earning it the eight extra seats it needs for a majority.

The Congress has accused the BJP of ""murdering the democracy"". ","panaji:"

But women haven't done as well when it comes to holding elected offices.

Only five women have been elected to the state assembly in the just-concluded elections; 62 of the over 630 candidates in the fray this year were women. The outgoing assembly too had only five women lawmakers.

Between the Congress and the BJP, the two big parties fielded just 12 candidates including eight from the Congress. Three won from the BJP, and two from the Congress.

BJP leader Sushila Baluni, also a prominent name in movement for a separate state, said she congratulated the women who made it. ""But this is not the Uttarakhand that I and countless other daughters of the hills had struggled for,"" she said.

The former chairperson of the state's women panel said ""recognising the importance of women's role in politics is the beginning of recognising their role in democracy.""

Among the three women who made it from the BJP is a politician who joined from the Congress, Rekha Arya and the daughter of a former chief minister, Ritu Khanduri Bhushan. The third was Meena Gangola from Gangolighat who won with a little over eight hundred votes.

From the Congress, the two successful lawmakers include Mamta Rakesh who took the plunge in electoral politics from Bhagwanpur seat after her husband's death in 2015. She defeated her brother-in-law Subodh Rakesh by over two thousand votes, retaining the seat she had first won in a by poll.

                                Congress leaders have welcomed the Supreme Court's order for a trust vote in Goa within 48 hours, the judge's sharp observations to it notwithstanding. Digvijaya Singh, the Congress leader in-charge of Goa described it as a ""great victory,"" though he did not explain his comments. The party's lawyer and senior leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it was important that the court heard the Congress petition ""patiently on a holiday"" and that ""the Governor's decision has been interfered with.""

""If someone wants to be Chief Minister for two days, he is welcome,"" Mr Singhvi said about BJP leader Manohar Parrikar, who has got a go-ahead from the top court to take oath as Goa Chief Minister this evening.

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi alleged that the BJP has used ""money power"" to annex power in Goa. He accused the party of ""misusing the governor's post.""

The Congress had moved the top court against Goa Governor Mridula Sinha inviting the BJP to form government in the state despite the Congress winning more seats in the assembly elections. The court did not accept the Congress' plea to stop Mr Parrikar from taking oath this evening and said he must prove that he has majority support on Thursday. The Congress has won 17 seats, the BJP has won 13 but moved fast to secure the support of smaller parties. A party must have the support of 21 MLAs in the 40-member assembly to form government.

The Congress says it too has 21 and should have been consulted by the Governor as the largest party before she invited the BJP.","panaji:"
"478","Trust Deficit With Youth Cost Congress Uttarakhand, Concedes Harish Rawat","                             Outgoing Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat who led the Congress to its disastrous performance in the assembly polls has conceded that his inability to bridge the trust-deficit of the youth towards the party had contributed to its dismal performance.

The youth make up for over half of Uttarakhand's 75 lakh voters, half of them in the 19-29 age group.

Mr Rawat said somewhere, a major trust-deficit existed on the part of the youth towards him and his party.

""The whole of Uttarakhand wanted change and youngsters are included in that. Still, I would like to tell youngsters that we will continue to fulfil our major poll promises, but now while sitting in opposition,"" the chief minister told NDTV.

In the run-up to the elections, Mr Rawat had promised the youth free smart phones, jobs to 20 lakh and control distress-migration of youth from the state by 2022.

But how did the youth of Uttarakhand respond?

""There's a difference between claims and evidence. Change is necessary, for after all, development only happens when a new government comes to power,"" said 22 year old Prateek, a student from Chakrata.

""I have voted for Modi in these elections. I don't know about leaders from Uttarakhand, but Modi has an image which resonates with the youngsters across the state. Only he can do something for the youth,"" said 21-year-old Aryaveer Kothiyal.

""The Congress was unable to do anything about this so we will have to give BJP a chance; let's see what happens in the next 5 years,"" said Tejas, 19, a first-time voter from Dehradun. A state-level athlete, Nitesh, 20, echoed him. ""I have given my first-time vote to Modi for he seems like a leader who will take us all forward,"" he added.","dehardun:"
"479","Disquiet In Goa Congress Over Digvijaya Singh's 'Mismanagement'"," HighlightsDigvijaya Singh was the Congress' in-charge for the Goa election
Manohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa Chief Minister today
Congress has filed a plea at the Supreme Court to stop his oath ceremony
                                One day after Goa Governor Mridula Sinha invited the BJP to form the government, senior Congress leaders are coming under attack from some of its prominent lawmakers who are angry that their leaders weren't as quick as the BJP to negotiate support from smaller parties and stake claim despite its higher numbers.

The Congress had emerged as the single largest party with 17 legislators and reportedly had the support from an independent in the 40-seat assembly. It was just three short of the majority mark of 21. But it was the BJP - which had just 13 legislators - that ended up with the invite.

On Monday evening, the Congress knocked on the Supreme Court's doors in Delhi to stop Manohar Parrikar - who quit as Defence Minister earlier in the day - from taking oath on Tuesday evening. The petition has argued that the Governor should not have invited the BJP, but the Congress by virtue of the mandate to the party.

Back in Goa, state Congress leaders are not too sure if it is too late.

One of the more vocal critics of the party leadership was the Congress leader Vishwajit P Rane, the leader of opposition in the outgoing Goa assembly who many believed was in the running for the chief minister's job.

"480","PM Modi's Big Election Win Will Have 'Implications' On Sino-India Ties: Chinese Media","                             The BJP's landslide victory in state polls has ""implications"" for Sino-India ties as it could further embolden Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""hard-line attitude"" and pose difficulties for ""compromises"" in disagreements with countries like China, an opinion in China's official media said today. ""(Prime Minister) Modi recently led his Bharatiya Janata Party to a sweeping electoral victory in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most-populous state, as well as garnering vigorous support in several other major state elections,"" an op-ed in the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC)-run Global Times said.

In the first commentary by the Chinese state media after the poll results, the article said the results, ""not only increased Prime Minister Modi's chance to win in India's 2019 general elections, some even predict he is already set for a second term"".

""Since Beijing-New Delhi ties have recently entered a subtle and delicate phase, observers soon started to pay close attention to how the bilateral relationship will develop after (Prime Minister) Modi tightens his grip on power,"" it said.

Describing Narendra Modi as a ""man of action"" with a ""hard-line attitude"", the article said India's domestic and international polices have undergone change under him.

""(Prime Minister) Modi's hard-line attitude is embodied in both his domestic policies, such as the ban on high-value currency notes, and in his diplomatic logic,"" it said.

""In the international arena, he changed India's previous attitude of trying never to offend anyone and started to take a clear stance in controversies among other nations to maximise its own interests. He enhanced New Delhi's ties with China and Moscow and applied to be a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Yet he also upgraded defence collaboration with the US and Japan, articulated his support for the US rebalance to the Asia-Pacific strategy and Washington's stance on the South China Sea issue,"" it stated.

""If Modi wins the next election (2019), India's current firm and tough manner is bound to continue. It will be without question good news for the country's own development,"" it said.

""Nevertheless, it will likely mean more difficulties in making compromises in rows with other countries. Take the border disputes between Beijing and New Delhi. No silver lining has yet emerged and (Prime Minister) Modi demonstrated his firm stance over the issue by celebrating Diwali, India's biggest holiday, with soldiers at the Sino-India border,"" it said.

""But while seeming inflexible on the surface, hard-liners also have powerful strength in coming to an agreement with others once they make up their mind, given their executive ability and high efficiency,"" it said.

""That said, we can still be optimistic in resolving our divergences, including border disputes, with New Delhi during (Prime Minister) Modi's term as long as both sides are willing,"" it said.

""For China, it is also an opportunity to give more consideration over how to make breakthroughs in Beijing-New Delhi relations with a hard-line Indian government,"" the article claimed.

Last year, Sino-India ties hit multiple roadblocks after China blocked India's admission into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), as well as blocking a United Nations ban on terrorist Masood Azhar and over the construction of the 46-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

This year began on a positive note, with both sides holding an upgraded Strategic Dialogue covering almost all aspects of the relations which both sides termed as very positive.","beijing:"
"481","Uttarakhand Top Job Contenders: Heavyweights, Turncoats And The Dark Horse"," HighlightsBJP won the Uttarakhand assembly election by a landslide
The chief minister will be decided by the party's parliamentary board
Aspirants include Satpal Maharaj, Prakash Pant, TS Rawat, among others
                                Uttarakhand voters have spoken their mind, giving the BJP eight out of every ten assembly seats that went up for polls. Now it is the BJP leadership's turn, to pick one out of the state's long list of aspirants that includes turncoats, heavy-weights including former chief ministers and low-profile leaders - encouraged by the party's choices in Maharashtra and Haryana - hoping to be the proverbial dark horse.

In all, the party netted 56 out of 69 seats for which the results have been declared. The results in one seat will be announced after the re-poll in one polling booth on March 15. The BJP parliamentary board is expected to name the party's chief minister the next day.

Satpal Maharaj, a former Congressman who joined the BJP in 2014, after quitting the Congress on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections, is considered a key contender for the state's top post. Son of a spiritual master and a former Union Minister, he worked as a foot-soldier for two years before getting the ticket.

""Satpal Maharaj's contesting from the hill district of Pauri moves the political geography of Uttarakhand away from the plains to the hills. This may work in his favour,"" said a BJP leader.

The former Congress leader, however, has competition from Trivendra Singh Rawat, the BJP leader who also oversaw the party's affairs in Jharkhand earlier as the state in-charge. Rawat is believed to have the confidence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah and could have, in the words of a senior state BJP leader, ""be preferred by the party cadre over Satpal Maharaj"".

Prakash Pant, the Pithoragarh lawmaker who had PM Modi address an election rally in his constituency, is seen as another high-profile contender. The first speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly, Pant was also among the state leaders to rush to Delhi after counting ended.

And then, there are close to six candidates including four former CMs: Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Maj General BC Khanduri (retd), Ramesh Pokhriyal and Vijay Bahuguna who had joined the party from the Congress last year. There is speculation they might try to push their nominees if they don't make it.

A BJP leader Yatishwaranand, who defeated the Congress' Harish Rawat in his Haridwar Rural consistency, and Harak Singh Rawat, the former Congress leader who contested from Kotdwar seat, had also queued up. Some leaders suggested that party brass could also go for someone who had a toehold in state politics but yet wasn't deeply entrenched, someone like the party's national spokesperson who hails from Uttarakhand, Anil Baluni.","dehradun:"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday expressed happiness to see a new record of highest number of women MLAs elected to the new Uttar Pradesh Assembly.

The mega UP election which was held in seven rounds establishes the success of PM Modi as a brand and his massive campaigning. The results also confirmed to PM Modi's demonetisation drive that was announced before the elections aiming at rooting out corruption and counterfeit currency.","prime minister narendra modi welcomed holi by calling for a ""new india"" at the victory speech on sunday, as bjp celebrated the party's elating performance in the assembly elections in uttar pradesh and other states."
"486","PM Narendra Modi 'Favourite' To Win 2019 Lok Sabha Elections: US Experts"," HighlightsTop US experts say PM Modi is ""favourite"" to lead India after 2019
2017 UP election has proved that BJP's 2014 win wasn't an ""aberration""
However, BJP is unlikely to get a simple majority in 2019, said an expert
                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged as a clear favourite for the 2019 general elections after the BJP's landslide victory in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, top US experts on India have said. While one of the experts noted that the electoral results of the recently concluded Assembly polls in five states show that the 2014 Lok Sabha election results were not an aberration, another noted that Prime Minister Modi would continue to lead India after 2019.

The Assembly elections do not signal much of a change. The Uttar Pradesh election results showed that the 2014 general elections were not an ""aberration,"" Adam Ziegfeld, Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at the George Washington University said. ""It was a big win for the BJP. Its candidates won with a much larger margin of victory as compared to the two previous winners - BSP and Samajwadi Party,"" he said.

Prime Minister Modi has been established by this election as the ""clear and favourite winner"" for the 2019 general elections, Sadanand Dhume, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute said. ""PM Modi is the front runner (for 2019),"" he said.

However, Irfan Nooruddin, a professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service at the Georgetown University predicted that in 2019, the BJP is unlikely to be get a simple majority and that Prime Minister Modi would likely be heading a coalition government. BJP is running a disciplined election campaign state-by-state, while the Opposition fails, he said. ""The party does not do well in a state where it faces a direct opposition. BJP is beatable if the Opposition comes together,"" Mr Nooruddin said, adding that the party gains where it faces a fragmented opposition. He also said that by 2019, anti-incumbency would kick in.

""In this election, the BJP played the cast card while pretending to be above it,"" Sadanand Dhume, who was in Uttar Pradesh during the elections, said. ""Demonetisation was extremely popular. Indian people who have suffered themselves in the wake of the policy, it won their heart and mind. Here is this man of sincerity who struck a principled blow to corrupt and the rich,"" he said referring to his conversation with people in the state.

Mr Dhume, however, says that PM Modi after this historic victory in Uttar Pradesh is unlikely to go for the kind of economic reforms the private sector would like to have.

India is going to bump up its economic reforms that directly affects the people of the country, said Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. Picking up four governments in states all across India, and having future prospects, it is unlikely to have an impact on foreign policy. Like demonetisation #IamNewIndia is the pledge that the Prime Minister is asking citizens to be part of. This is his new India campaign.

BJP will now pick up a lot of seats in Rajya Sabha which would help the ruling party to carry out its long pending reform like the land acquisition reform and labor reforms. They would tart picking up seats as early as 2018. BJP is looking at 2019 and beyond.","washington:"
