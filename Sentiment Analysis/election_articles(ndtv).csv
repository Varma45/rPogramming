"'I'm A Man, Do Everything Openly': Nitin Gadkari On BJP's Goa Strategy","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/im-a-man-do-everything-openly-nitin-gadkari-on-bjps-goa-strategy-1696422","New Delhi: HighlightsMr Gadkari told Amit Shah that they had lost Goa, should concede defeat
Mr Shah asked him to rush to Goa, devise a strategy to turn things around
He refutes charges of horse-trading to form BJP-led government in Goa
                                As soon as the assembly elections results in Goa were announced in March -- in which the Congress emerged as the single largest party with 17 of the 40 seats in its kitty, but failed to immediately decide on who should be the chief minister -- the BJP, with four seats less than the rival got busy gathering support of smaller parties. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, the BJP leader in charge of Goa, met leaders of regional parties and independent legislators to convince them to help form and be part of a BJP-led government in the state.

 Mr Gadkari today revealed how the BJP turned its defeat into victory in Goa and managed the required numbers for forming the government and agreeing to make the then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar the chief minister. He added that while ""the Congress was sleeping, his party worked all night to form the government"".

However, he refuted charges of horse-trading during the hectic overnight parleys. ""I am not a person who does political deals. I am a 'mard' and do everything openly. I did not carry any money to anyone in Goa. I don't do such things. I fight and get things done,"" the senior BJP leader and Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister said at the India Today Editors Roundtable in Delhi.

The party had got 13 seats and Mr Gadkari informed BJP national president Amit Shah that the party had lost Goa and should concede defeat. However, Mr Shah asked him to devise a strategy to turn things around.

Soon after their meeting, Mr Gadkari packed his bags and started for Goa, he said.

Once in Goa, he met Sudin Dhavalikar of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) at the Taj hotel in Panaji who agreed to form an alliance with the BJP on the condition that he be given a ministerial berth. With the MGP's support, BJP's strength went to 16 and then he was approached by Vijay Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party (GFP).

""He had been a Congress man for his entire life. But he was being tortured by the Congress for past five years. We had got Dinesh Singh, a wrestler from Uttar Pradesh, and is a friend of Sardesai. He convinced Sardesai,"" Mr Gadkari said.

Mr Sardesai, along with a ministerial berth, wanted Manohar Parrikar to be made the chief minister.

Around 2.45 am he rang up Mr Shah about the demand. ""I had asked Parrikar, he said he would do whatever party asked (him) to do. But, my reading of his mind was that he was more than happy to return to Goa. I told the same to Amit Shah,"" he said.

What followed next needs no guessing.

"High Court Mutes EVM (Vote Machine) Criticism... Not Even On Twitter Or Facebook","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-high-court-mutes-evm-criticism-says-political-parties-individuals-cannot-criticise-evms-1707345","NEW DELHI:                             Coming to the defence of the Election Commission that has been the target of attacks from political parties over its voting machines, the Uttarakhand High Court on Friday barred political parties and others from criticising the use of these machines, or EVMs, in the five state assembly elections till pending election petitions are decided.

A systematic campaign has been unleashed against the EC, a constitutional body, a two-judge bench of the high court said. It ruled that the foundation of democracy would be weakened in case this tendency to damage constitutional bodies by levelling unsubstantiated allegations was not curbed. It added that the right of freedom of speech did not permit levelling unsubstantiated charges against the functionaries of the constitutional bodies.

""We, however, in the larger public interest, restrain"" all political parties, non-governmental organizations and individuals ""from criticising the use of EVMs in the recently conducted elections of the State Assemblies even by approaching the electronic media, press, radio, Facebook, Twitter etc. till the decision of the election petitions,"" the court said.

The verdict, which ends the no-holds barred attack launched by the Aam Aadmi Party, also puts a question mark on Arvind Kejriwal's plan to conduct a parallel hackathon on Saturday that taunted the election commission for its restrictive ground rules. Under these rules, AAP's Saurabh Bharadwaj said, even its look-alike EVM could not be tampered.

The court allowed the election commission to go ahead with the EVM Challenge that it was to hold on Saturday but frowned at the event nonetheless, observing that it ""may influence the outcome of election petitions wittingly or unwittingly"".

Only two parties, the Nationalist Congress Party and the CPI-M had applied to participate in tomorrow's EVM challenge conducted by the commission to put all concerns about the machine's reliability at rest. Representatives of the two political parties can, however, only fiddle with the buttons, and not open the machines."
"Amid Dissent, BJP Meets In Karnataka For Mission 150","http://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/amid-dissent-bjp-meets-in-karnatakas-mysuru-for-mission-150-1690294","Bengaluru: HighlightsBefore the meet, KS Eshwarappa went againt state party leaders
All eyes were on state BJP who need to be united for the upcoming polls
Mission 150 targets winning 150 of 224 seats in 2018 Karnataka elections
                                There has been an unusual amount of interest in the state executive meet of the BJP in Karnataka that began today in Mysuru. The two-day meet, attended by state leaders and central representatives, is focussed on Mission 150 - the target of winning 150 out of 224 seats in Karnataka's Assembly elections scheduled for next year.

But the real interest from the media and political watchers was on another, unstated mission - the urgent need for the state BJP to get its act together and be united in the countdown to those polls.

The run-up to the meet had seen defiance of state party president and former chief minister, BS Yeddyurappa by KS Eshwarappa, a Kuruba leader. In December last year, Mr Eshwarappa launched the Sangolli Rayana Brigade, a Dalit and backward class organisation, against the wishes of Mr Yeddyurappa. Late last month, he and his followers held a meeting in Bengaluru - to 'save' the party from what they said was Mr Yeddyurappa's autocratic style of functioning. Mr Yeddyurappa protested.

The BJP high command took notice of the row and four office bearers - two from each side - were removed by state in-charge Muralidhara Rao.

There was speculation whether Mr Eshwarappa would even attend the Mysuru meet. But he did arrive, one of the last leaders to do so. He told NDTV as he entered, ""I do not wish to say anything none,"" in response to our questions on party unity. A meeting of the Sangolli Ratana Brigade, scheduled on Monday in Raichur has been postponed.

There were small problems that had been sorted out, Union Minister Ananth Kumar told NDTV. Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar said that he would only speak about party matters in the party forum - and that the meet was to focus on strategy for the election.

Karnataka was described by the BJP as its Gateway to the South - and Mr Yeddyurappa was its first chief minister in its first government in southern India in 2009. It earlier had an uneasy coalition with the Janata Dal Secular in the state which did not end well - but the party came back to form the government by itself.

Outwardly, the Mysuru meet is progressing peacefully. But the party clearly needs to deal with its unity before taking on the ruling Congress at the polls."
"Arvind Kejriwal's Hackathon Vs Election Commission's: What To Expect","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/14-vote-machines-evms-ready-for-hackathon-some-used-in-uttar-pradesh-1707064","New Delhi: HighlightsPolitical parties had alleged vote machines can be rigged
Election Commission's challenge accepted by 2 parties
AAP rejects Election Commission's event, will hold its own hackathon
                                The Election Commission has organised more than 10 vote machines that were recently used in elections in Uttar Pradesh for tomorrow's hackathon, where political parties will try to prove in Delhi that the machines can be rigged.

A total of 14 Electronic Voting Machines or EVMs will be made available to representatives of Sharad Pawar's party NCP and the Left who hope to prove that the Election Commission is wrong and that the equipment used by it can be gamed, as alleged by a series of political outfits including the Congress and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party or AAP after Prime Minister Narendra Modi front-lined his party's gigantic wins in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

AAP, which has accused the Election Commission of colluding with the BJP to rig results in its favour, has announced that it will hold a parallel hackathon of its own tomorrow. The machine it will make available to techies and others is the one that was used by the party in the Delhi Assembly last month in a televised demonstration of its manipulation. The Election Commission said the machine used was a far cry from the real thing and rejected the result.

At the Election Commission's event, hackers will get five hours - from 10 am to 2 pm - and access to four machines each. The other EVMs will be kept as back up. 

The Election Commission has said its challenge has two parts - the hackers will have to prove that the EVMs used in the five states that just voted including UP and Punjab were manipulated to favour a particular candidate or political party by altering the results stored in them.

In their effort, hackers will be permitted to use a combination of keys or buttons on the electronic machines, or over the air communication devices such as cellphones and Bluetooth to tamper with the machine to change the results.

Part Two of the challenge calls for participants to prove that the machines used in the assembly polls were manipulated before or on the day of voting. 

The participant will be considered ""failed"" if the EVM stops functioning as a result of its inbuilt defense mechanism against tampering.

The participants - three members per party - can ""physically examine"" EVMs and check circuits, chips and motherboard, but cannot replace any part. Arvind Kejriwal's party had asked for these restrictions to be removed, claiming it ""would not be possible to tamper with the machines without giving people a free hand to do so."""
"BS Yeddyurappa Will Be BJP's Chief Ministerial Face In Karnataka: Amit Shah","http://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/bs-yeddyurappa-will-be-bjps-chief-ministerial-face-in-karnataka-amit-shah-1704469","New Delhi:                             Former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa will be the BJP's chief ministerial face in the Assembly polls scheduled early next year, party president Amit Shah said on Friday.

During an interaction with the Press Trust of India, Mr Shah also indicated that Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani would be the party's choice for the top post in the state, asserting that it would win more than 150 seats in the Assembly polls slated later this year. The Assembly has 182 seats.

He, however, said the party has not yet decided on its chief ministerial face in Himachal Pradesh, which goes to polls along with Gujarat.

""It (Karnataka election) will be fought under Yeddyurappa,"" Mr Shah said.

Asked if it meant that Mr Yeddyurappa, who is the BJP's Karnataka unit chief, will be the chief ministerial face, he said, ""He will be.""

The Karnataka unit has been facing factional fight with a group headed by former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa targeting Mr Yeddyurappa's leadership.

To a question on the party's state of affairs in Karnataka, Mr Shah said he would visit the state soon. The party had recently taken action against some leaders, suspected to be behind the internal wrangling.

Asked whether Mr Rupani will be the party's CM face in Gujarat, Mr Shah said, ""He is already the chief minister.""

""What does it mean that he will be the chief ministerial face...,"" he said in a lighter vein.

Mr Yeddyurappa, 74, an influential Lingayat leader, had led the BJP to its maiden victory in the southern state in 2008, but was forced to resign following charges of corruption against him.

He floated his own outfit in 2011. Though his party performed poorly in the 2013 Assembly polls, it managed to wean away a substantial chunk of the BJP votes, leading to a rout of the BJP.

He returned to the BJP fold ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election."
"Army Chief Backs 'Innovative' Tactics For 'Dirty War' In Kashmir: Report","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/army-chief-backs-innovative-tactics-for-dirty-war-in-kashmir-report-1704839","New Delhi:                             Army chief General Bipin Rawat, who recently gave a Commendation Card to Major Leetul Gogoi -- the officer who tied a man to the bonnet of a jeep while rescuing a group of election officials during assembly elections in Srinagar -- today said innovative tactics were required for Kashmir, where a ""dirty war"" is on.

""When people are throwing stones and petrol bombs at us, I cannot tell my men 'just wait and die',"" General Rawat was quoted as saying by news agency Press Trust Of India.

""I would have been happy if the protesters were firing weapons at the armed forces instead of throwing stones,"" General Rawat said."
"In Politically Fragile Goa, Congress Takes Aim At Manohar Parrikar's MLA Election","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-politically-fragile-goa-congress-takes-aim-at-manohar-parrikars-mla-election-1693471","Panaji:                             A flurry of political activity in Goa, a state with 40 assembly seats, has triggered fresh reports of political uncertainty.

There are speculations, some even bordering on whether the Congress is attempting a ""coup"" on Manohar Parrikar who will have to contest an election to become a legislator in September to cement his position as the Chief Minister of the state.

After the sacking of the Congress in-charge of Goa, Digvijaya Singh, who was blamed for botching up the Congress's prospect of forming a government in the state, the new in-charge, A Chellakumar, is now trying to give Goa a fresh shot.

Sources say that Mr Chellakumar camped in Goa for five days and was in touch with some legislators to see how the party that has 15 MLAs and is five short of the government formation mark could be back in the saddle.

When asked about these reports of an attempted coup, Mr Chellakumar said ""Goa is a small state where everyone is in touch with everyone."" He also added that ""Goans voted against the BJP in 26 seats so it was a vote against Manohar Parrikar.""

Congress sources say that Mr Parrikar is worried about his prospects of a safe election from Panaji hence the BJP is giving wind to rumours of the Congress trying to orchestrate a coup.

There's also intense speculation that the three MLAs of current BJP-led coalition partner ""Goa Forward"" could abandon the BJP - a party it was ideologically opposed to before the elections. This forced ""Goa Forward's"" Vijay Sardesai to take to Facebook Live and clarify that there were no such plans. Trashing the reports, he told NDTV that he said ""We are getting the respect in the government. Our positions on issues are becoming policies and it is because of the Goa Forward that Manohar Parrikar is chief minister.""

The BJP's Goa General Secretary Sadanand Tanavde told NDTV that ""Manohar Parrikar is a strong leader and will easily win in the elections that are expected to take place in September. The Congress's A Chellakumar is making false claims that the party is in touch with some MLAs because he is struggling to keep his flock together.""

The Congress had won 17 of the state's 40 seats in the recently concluded assembly elections. But as the party bickered over who would be Chief Minister, the BJP, which won four seats less, stitched together a coalition with regional parties and Independent legislators. Because the potential allies wanted Manohar Parrikar - who till then was the Union Defence Minister - to lead the government, he was shifted back to Goa. The miffed Congress had cried foul, saying it should have been given change to form the government."
"From 2024 Hold Lok Sabha Elections, Assembly Polls Simultaneously: NITI Aayog","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/from-2024-hold-lok-sabha-elections-assembly-polls-simultaneously-niti-aayog-1687819","New Delhi:                             The NITI Aayog has suggested a synchronised two-phase Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024 so as to ensure minimum 'campaign-mode' disruption to governance. Outlining the details, the policy think-tank has said implementing the proposal may necessitate ""a maximum one-time curtailment or extension of some state assemblies"".

It has made the Election Commission the nodal agency to look into the suggestion and recommended setting up of a working group of stakeholders for deciding a road-map for synchronised elections.

A report in this regard need to be finalised within six months and final blue-print will be ready by next March, as per draft three-year action agenda for 2017-18 to 2019-20. The draft report was circulated among the Governing Council members (consisting of chief ministers of all states and others) of the NITI Aayog on April 23.

The recommendation assumes significance as President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pitched for simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls.

""All elections in India should happen in a free, fair and synchronised manner so as to cause minimum 'campaign-mode' disruption to governance. We may begin work towards switching to a synchronised two-phase election from the 2024 election to the Lok Sabha,"" the NITI Aayog draft report says.

This would require a maximum one-time curtailment or extension of some state assemblies, it said.

""To implement this in the national interest, a focused group of stakeholders comprising constitution and subject matter experts, think-tanks, government officials and representatives of various political parties should be formed to work out appropriate implementation-related details.

""This may include drafting appropriate Constitution and statutory amendments, agreeing on a workable framework to facilitate transition to simultaneous elections, developing a stakeholder communication plan and various operational details,"" the draft report says.

President Mukherjee in his speech on the eve of this year's Republic Day had favoured holding Lok Sabha and assembly elections together. ""The time is also ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after Independence when elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously. It is for the Election Commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties,"" President Mukherjee had said.

PM Modi had in February made a strong pitch for simultaneous elections. ""It (simultaneous polls) will cause some loss to all, including us,"" he had said, and asked political parties to not look at the idea through narrow the prism of politics.

""One party or a government cannot do it. We will have to find a way together,"" he had said.

Elections are being held all the time somewhere or else in the country and continuous elections lead to lot of expenditure, PM Modi had said replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.

The prime minister had said over Rs. 1,100 crore was spent in holding the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and the expenditure shot up to Rs. 4,000 crore in 2014.

He had said that over a crore government employees, including a lot of teachers, are involved in electoral process and the continuous exercise thus causes maximum harm to the education sector.

Security forces also have to be diverted for electoral works across the year even while enemy country keeps plotting against the nation and terrorism remains a strong threat, PM Modi had said."
"Supreme Court Seeks Centre's Response On Plea For VVPAT For Gujarat Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-seeks-centres-response-on-plea-for-paper-audit-trail-vvpat-for-gujarat-polls-1690588","New Delhi:                             The Supreme Court has sought response of the Centre and the chief election commissioner on a plea filed a Gujarat Patidar leader seeking the use of either ballot paper or electronic voting machines with paper trail for the upcoming Assembly election in the state.

A bench of Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justices DY Chandrachud and SK Kaul issued notice to the Centre, the CEC, the Gujarat government and the state election commission, and sought their response in four weeks. The top court posted the matter for hearing to the first week of July.

Petitioner Reshma Vithabhai Patel, the convener of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti, which was in the forefront of the Patel quota agitation, claimed that EVMs were not ""fully reliable, foolproof, tamper-proof or hacker-proof"". The plea was dismissed by the Gujarat High Court on April 12.

The Election Commission should be asked to replace EVMs with ballot paper, or to ensure Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) for every EVM, she had demanded.

The Assembly election in Gujarat is due later this year. The plea by Ms Patel had also alleged that the names of thousands of members of a ""particular community"" were missing from voter lists in the 2015 municipal corporation polls. It had sought the court's direction to the poll panel to prevent this in future.

She has said that the high court has erred in not appreciating that the Supreme Court had passed its judgement on October 18, 2013, asking ensuring polling through EVMs with paper trail but despite that it has not been implemented by the the ECI and the State Election Commission.

In her plea, it was contended that the high court has erred in not appreciating that there are allegations that at the behest of the ruling party, the names of voters were deleted from voter lists in the last six municipal corporations elections held in 2015."
"Digvijaya Singh Dropped As Congress In-Charge Of Goa, Karnataka","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/digvijaya-singh-removed-as-congress-in-charge-of-goa-karnataka-report-1687612","New Delhi: HighlightsDigvijaya Singh led the Congress' campaign in the Goa polls
It failed to form a government, despite being the largest party
Assembly elections in Congress-ruled Karnataka will be held next year
                                The Congress has removed its senior leader Digvijaya Singh as the party's in-charge in Goa and Karnataka. The decision comes nearly a month after the Congress failed to form a government in Goa despite emerging as the single largest party, commissioning biting criticism of Mr Singh from his colleagues and ridicule from opponents. He has been replaced in Goa by A Chellakumar and Lok Sabha member KC Venugopal in Karnataka.

""Congress president Sonia Gandhi has assigned the tasks of looking after Karnataka and Goa affairs to new AICC teams. While KC Venugopal has been made general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, A Chellakumar has been made AICC in-charge of Goa,"" party general secretary Janaradan Dwivedi said in a statement.

In elections held in February, the Congress managed to win 17 of the total 40 seats in Goa. However, as it took too long to make up its mind on post-poll alliances, the BJP quickly stitched up partnerships with regional parties and formed the government under former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.

In his farewell speech in the Rajya Sabha last month, Mr Parrikar took a jibe at Mr Singh and said, ""My special thanks to honourable member Digvijaya Singh, who happened to be in Goa but did nothing so that I could form the government.""

The Congress' inability to form the government in Goa also led to the resignation of Vishwajit Rane - who was seen as a possible Chief Ministerial candidate in Goa - from the party. Mr Rane, now a BJP member, openly criticised Mr Singh and accused him of ""mismanagement"".

The Congress has removed Mr Singh, a former two-time Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, as its in-charge in Karnataka, one of the few states currently held by the party. Assembly elections in the state will be held next year and the Congress would not want to relive it Goa experience."
"Meghalaya BJP Leader Quits Party Protesting Against Cattle Trade Rule","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/meghalaya-bjp-leader-resigns-from-party-in-protest-against-centres-cattle-trade-rule-1706678","New Delhi:                             As the Central government confronts strong opposition to its new rule banning cattle trade for slaughter in south and the northeast, a BJP leader in Meghalaya has resigned in protest. Bernard Marak, a leader from Garo hills, had recently caused a stir by promising cheaper beef to people if they voted the BJP to power.

Assembly polls are due early next year in the hill state, where beef is a staple.

""I have decided to quit the party because I am a Christian and Garo first,"" Mr Marak said today, adding, ""The BJP is hurting the sentiments here on the beef issue. Tribal society has its own laws. The BJP is trying to push Hindutva.""

Mr Marak's cheaper beef offer earlier this week discomfited the party as its government at the Centre faced criticism about its new cattle trade rules. The state BJP distanced itself from Mr Marak's comments, calling those his own views. Meghalaya BJP chief Shibun Lyndoh said the party ""is not against people having beef"".

""Total beef ban is something that even people here do not support,"" he said, adding what was required in the state were regulations and hygienic slaughter houses.

The BJP is yet to comment on the exit of the leader, who commands a chunk of the tribal votes.

""Bernard is right to the extent that there are people in the BJP in Meghalaya who eat beef... In Meghalaya it is not the BJP's agenda to put a beef ban,"" said senior BJP leader Nalin Kohli. But he denied that the party will push for cheaper beef if it comes to power. ""It is not the BJP's agenda to run markets that sale beef. That is for the market to decide. What Bernard says is his personal view not the party's view. ""

The new cattle trade rule of the Centre, that has triggered widespread protests in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, says cattle sold in animal markers cannot be used for slaughter. After Kerala and West Bengal, Tripura's Left government has said it will not implement the rule, describing it as ""anti-people""."

KS Eshwarappa calls off meeting of Sangolli Rayana Brigade
                                The two-day executive meet of the Karnataka BJP unit, that ends today in Mysuru, saw the party trying hard to present a united front and keep it together. Ahead of the meet, backward class leader KS Eshwarappa continued his open defiance against state party president, BS Yeddyurappa. Also, there was little interaction between the two during the meet that focused on Mission 150 - the target of winning 150 out of 224 seats in Karnataka's Assembly elections scheduled for next year.

But the party insists ""all is well'.  Senior party leader Katta Subramanya Naidu told NDTV, ""We are all one group, one family.""

State General Secretary and Mr Yeddyurappa loyalist, Shoba Karandlaje also said that the former chief minister and Mr Eshwarappa would work together. ""They are together now. All will be well in the near future,"" she said.

 As Mr Eshwarappa moved a motion on Sunday demanding a loan waiver for farmers, the lack of interaction between him and Mr Yeddyurappa was evident. However, Mr Eshwarappa's presence at the venue indicated that the central party leadership has brought him into line. He has also called off, at least for now, a meeting of Sangolli Rayana Brigade, a group of backward classes and Dalits that he launched in December against the wishes of Mr Yeddyurappa, scheduled for Monday in Raichur in north Karnataka. 

Last month, Mr Eshwarappa's side held a conclave in Bengaluru to 'save' the party from what they alleged was Mr Yeddyurappa's autocratic style of functioning. The BJP high command took notice of the row and four office bearers - two from each side - were removed by state in charge Muralidhara Rao.

The BJP understands that if it has to win Karnataka back in 2018, the ongoing infighting could prove costly. Which is why all the leaders are expected to drop their differences and move ahead as a unified squad."
"Shaking Up Elections, Corporate Tax: What India's 3-Year Plan Looks Like","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shaking-up-elections-corporate-tax-what-indias-3-year-plan-looks-like-1687915","New Delhi: HighlightsNITI Aayog proposes 3-year agenda after PM meets Chief Ministers
Suggests simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024
Corporate tax holiday for job creators, farm tax reform also suggested
                                Any talk of taxing farm incomes turned out to be a political hot potato but NITI Aayog's three-year action agenda - discussed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Ministers last week - has set out several ambitious goals.

One of the most far reaching suggestions by NITI Aayog is to hold simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024. The report says, ""There should be synchronized two-phase elections even if that means curtailing or extending the tenure of some assemblies in national interest.""

The action plan says that the Election Commission should form working groups of stakeholders and submit a report by March 2018.

On curbing black money, the action plan says tax rates should be moderate and transparent. Real sector should be reformed and Aadhaar should be linked to real estate transactions, it says.

The most interesting part is with regard to taxes on agricultural incomes. On Wednesday, NITI Aayog had claimed that member Bibek Debroy's suggestion - that ultimately the rural sector including agriculture should be taxed - was his personal view.

But the final report said: ""All agricultural income is currently exempt from income tax regardless of its size. While the provision is meant to protect farmers, non-agricultural entities sometimes use it to evade taxes by declaring agriculture as the source of their income. In order to mitigate the generation of black money, the loopholes need to be plugged.""

Another ambitious project is to create well-paid jobs. Comparing India with China's job growth, the report says, ""Many super competitive firms in China today employ not just tens of thousands of workers but hundreds of thousands of them. In contrast, there are hardly any firms in India employing hundreds of thousands of workers.""

NITI's action plan says companies that create 10,000 jobs within three years of setting up should be given a corporate tax holidays for five years. It has also suggested zero per cent GST for six years to companies that employ 20,000 workers.

Other suggestions include setting up coastal employment zone and faster labour reforms.

At Confederation of Indian Industry's annual session on Friday, the head of NITI was blunt about the private sector's track record of creating jobs.

""Why I do not see a single industrialist putting up a factory of 250,000 workers doing apparel?"" asked Dr Arvind Panagariya.

At the moment, NITI Aayog's draft report has been circulated among state governments for their will give their feedback and suggestions before the policy think tank finalises India's growth roadmap."

Mr Shah also wrote off the Aam Aadmi Party, which came a feeble second, mocking Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for blaming his party's drubbing on electronic voting machines or EVMs.

Delhi was won for the BJP by its booth-level workers, Mr Shah said at a celebration of his party's win with party workers and new corporators in the capital. The BJP has won 181 of 272 seats in three corporations. AAP could win only 48.

""Kejriwal-ji might blame EVMs for our victory, but to know the real reason, meet our booth in-charge,"" said Mr Shah, whose winning strategy in Delhi included sacking most sitting corporators to beat any anti-incumbency sentiment after 10 years of the BJP dominating the Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD.    
 Amit Shah said that the BJP's victory was the ""foundation"" for the next assembly elections in DelhiThe Aam Aadmi Party had, in allegations now toned down, said after the MCD election results that rigged EVMs aided the BJP's re-election to Delhi's three corporations.   

Mr Kejriwal has since embarked on an organisational shake-up and outreach at the grassroots to rebuild his party, which is reeling from multiple election defeats. Earlier this year, it failed make a dent in Punjab, where Mr Kejriwal had expected to establish a second AAP government after Delhi. In Goa, the party could not win a single seat.

Just two years ago, Mr Kejriwal's party had shocked the BJP winning 67 of Delhi's 70 seats. The BJP could win only three. The Delhi assembly elections had put the brakes on the BJP's winning since its victory in the 2014 national elections, and the party, still smarting from the huge defeat, had launched a campaign to win the civic polls on the scale of a state election.

Mr Shah said today that the BJP's victory was the ""foundation"" for the next assembly elections in Delhi. ""The mandate of the national capital is the nation's mandate. It establishes once again that the people of India are firmly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" he added."
"Goa Rajya Sabha Polls: Congress Plans Non-BJP Parties' 'Consensus Nominee'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-rajya-sabha-polls-congress-plans-non-bjp-parties-consensus-nominee-1695446","Panaji:                             After failing to form the government in Goa despite emerging as the single largest party in the assembly polls, the Congress is now planning to field a ""consensus candidate"" of the non-BJP parties for the lone Rajya Sabha seat in the state.

Talking to Press Trust of India, All India Congress Committee secretary Girish Chodankar today said, ""We will be fielding a candidate, who will be acceptable to all the parties. When I say that I mean all the non-BJP parties.""

Goa has the lone Rajya Sabha seat, which is currently represented by Congress leader Shantaram Naik. The election to the RS seat would be held on June 8.

Mr Chodankar said, ""Congress will field a consensus candidate, who will be acceptable to all the parties, including the Goa Forward Party, the Maharashrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and other independents, who are part of the Manohar Parrikar-led state government.

The Congress leader said, ""The upcoming RS election will be fought cutting across the party lines with the sole aim to have a non-BJP candidate winning it.""

When contacted, BJP Goa general secretary Sadanand Tanawade said his party was yet to decide the candidate, but it would be a choice of all the parties, which support the Parrikar-led government.

""We will meet tomorrow to finalise the name of the candidate for the RS polls,"" Mr Tanawade said.

""Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar will take a call on this. The candidate that BJP will field will have support of all the coalition partners,"" Mr Tanawade said.

Goa Forward Party's mentor Vijai Sardesai was unavailable for comment, but a senior party functionary said that they were yet to take decision on the RS poll.

""Ideally, we will go with the ruling government as we are part of it,"" he said."
"After BS Yeddyurappa Eats Hotel Food At Dalit Home, BJP Explains Why","http://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/bjps-bs-yeddyurappa-eats-idlis-ordered-from-hotel-at-dalits-home-party-says-food-ran-out-1696806","Bengaluru: HighlightsBJP accuses Congress of trying to discredit state party chief Yeddyurappa
The BJP claims that the food cooked by the Dalit family ran out
The assembly elections in Karnataka will take place next year
                                The BJP in Karnataka has rubbished the allegation that its state chief BS Yeddyurappa refused to eat food cooked at a Dalit's home last week and instead ate idlis ordered from a hotel. The party has said that food ran out while Mr Yeddyurappa and his team were at the home of Madhu Kumar in Chitradurga district for breakfast, and so more was bought from outside.

A man called D Venkatesh has filed a police complaint against Mr Yeddurappa, accusing him of casteism. 

""Yeddyurappa and party workers had gone to a Dalit house. There, food was cooked and served. As food ran out, some food was obtained from outside. We cannot say what items were prepared and who ate what, but the best proof is from the family itself which says they served Yeddyurappa the food they cooked and that it was a happy occasion,"" said BJP's Suresh Kumar.

On a video circulated by the BJP, Madhu Kumar, a member of the family that Mr Yedduruappa visited, said, ""We were very happy to hear that the former chief minister was coming to our house. He came on Friday, May 19, at 8.30am. We served him breakfast that we had cooked at home. He ate the breakfast. But because more people had come we had to get food from outside too.""

D Venkatesh has filed a police complaint against Mr Yeddurappa in a different district, Mandya. He has no known political links, but the BJP said it spots an attempt by the ruling Congress to discredit Mr Yeddyurappa, who is on a tour of the state, his party said, to learn about the problems of the people in a drought year. Karnataka votes for a new government next year and the BJP hopes to snatch the state back from the Congress. 

""The Congress cannot take my going to Dalits' homes and eating with them and asking about their difficulties, trying to help them. So they are trying to give it a different colour. I went again today to a Dalit colony. I went to a slum and spoke with them about their difficulties,"" Mr Yeddyurappa, 74, said in Bagalkote.

Reacting to Mr Yeddyurappa, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said, ""He has been in politics for 40 years. Didn't he remember the Dalits before this? To go there, order hotel food and eat it? What affection is there for the Dalits."""
"Arvind Kejriwal Begins AAP Reconstruction, Bigger Role Likely For Kumar Vishwas","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-begins-aap-reconstruction-bigger-role-likely-for-kumar-vishwas-1688446","New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal pacifies Kumar Vishwas by removing MLA from key post
Mr Kejriwal to meet all 64 AAP legislators one on one, get feedback
Changes in AAP's national team expected, Mr Vishwas to get bigger role
                                A week after he was dealt a deadly blow in the Delhi civic elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has begun reconstructive surgery of his Aam Aadmi Party, starting with an outreach to the over 60 legislators who had won the party a massive mandate in assembly elections in the national capital just two years ago. Up ahead, said sources, are major changes in the party's leadership structure that could see leaders like AAP's founder member Kumar Vishwas play a greater role.

Mr Kejriwal pacified an upset Mr Vishwas yesterday by removing from a key party post Amanatullah Khan, a Delhi legislator who had accused him of attempting to replace the party chief. Many AAP lawmakers from both Delhi and Punjab had backed Mr Vishwas against what they saw as an attempt to scuttle his chances at being elevated in the party; he is currently only responsible for overseas funding.

From today, Mr Kejriwal will meet each of his 64 Delhi legislators one on one and will gather feedback on the party's work at the ground level. He will also meet AAP's volunteers, seen as the young party's backbone in its dream surge to prominence, but who seem to have lost steam after successive defeats this year - first in the Punjab and Goa assembly elections and then the drubbing the Delhi civic polls.

Mr Kejriwal has been accused of losing touch with the grassroots in recent days as his ambitions to expand AAP nationally have grown and sources close to him said he is keen to refurbish his image of a transparent and accessible leader. They also said that he is being extremely cautious in determining new roles for leaders in AAP.

Kumar Vishwas had on Saturday rued that the AAP chief is now surrounded by ""yes men"" who misguided him into blaming what he alleged were rigged electronic voting machines or EVMs for his party's loss to the BJP in Delhi.

A meeting called by Mr Kejriwal of top AAP leaders later assessed that the election drubbing in fact indicates an urgent need for organisational restructuring. Top leaders like Sanjay Singh, Dilip Pandey and Durgesh Pathak resigned last week from key party posts owning responsibility for the Delhi defeat and Mr Kejriwal will first appoint a new Delhi AAP team. He has already named Delhi minister Gopal Rai to head it in Dilip Pandey's place.

Changes in the national team are expected next, said sources, and that is when Mr Vishwas is expected to be given a bigger role by Mr Kejriwal, though it is not known yet what that role will be."

Mr Yeddyurappa was named the party's choice for the Chief Minister's post by BJP chief Amit Shah in August.

Assembly elections in the state are due next year, in which the Congress is trying to stay in power for the second consecutive term.

The Congress today announced some restructuring within the party. The changes come after party vice president Rahul Gandhi's strategy meet with the key state leaders.

State Home Minister G Parameshwara will step down from the cabinet and devote himself to his duties as chief of the party's state unit, the party has said. A statement from party's national general secretary Janardan Dwivedi also announced the elevation of SR Patil, Dinesh Gundurao, minister DK Shivakumar, former Union minister K H Muniyappa and Satish Jarkiholi in various party posts.

The appointments have been made keeping in mind all sections and castes of the state. While Siddaramaiah is a key leader from the Kuruba Gowda community, Mr Parameshwara and Mr Muniyappa are Dalit leaders. The dominant Lingayat and community is represented by Mr Patil, the Vokkaligas by Mr Shivakumar. Mr Jarkiholi has a huge following among tribals.

The BJP, which recently saw a revolt against Mr Yeddyurappa by backward class leader KS Easwarappa, is trying to keep a united front.  Amit Shah has spelt out the party's target -- Mission 150 -- 150 seats in the 224-member state assembly. The party, which has been hoping for big gains, recently acquired Congress veteran SM Krishna, a former Chief Minister and a powerhouse in the state."
"No Credible Proof On EVM Tampering, Says Election Commission: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/election-commissions-live-demo-to-prove-vote-machines-cant-be-tampered-with-highlights-1696048","New Delhi:                             The Election Commission (EC) set the date for the challenge to show that voting machines or EVMs can be tampered with. The challenge begins from June 3. Last Friday, the top election body had held an all-party meet to discuss the upcoming 'EVM hackathon' after allegations that the voting machines were hacked in the recently-held assembly elections and the Delhi civic elections. Today, before a press conference, the Election Commission displayed the working of both an electronic voting machine or EVM and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail or VVPAT.

Here are the highlights of the press conference by Chief Election Commissioner Dr. Nasim Zaidi:The Commission has conducted elections successfully for 107 state assembliesSome people have doubts about about the EVMs. We have even got suggestions. But the EC has not received any credible information about these.We held an 8-hour meeting with political parties. The Commission has stated before parties that all future elections will be mandatory held with VVPATs.The Commission believes that the use of VVPATs will bring utmost transparency and credibility in the voting systemThe audit trail will make the voters feel confident. Once done, India will be the first country in the world to have elections with 100% VVPAT.The EC will hold a challenge and also prove that EVMs cannot be tampered with.People who questioned reliability of EVMs have not yet submitted any proof or credible material to support their claim.EC told political parties that their suggestions have been heard and that building confidence is a shared responsibility.Once the voter keys in their vote, the ballot unit sends the vote to the control unit in an encrypted format.People allege that EVMs can be manipulated by infecting the chip with a Trojan horse. We would like to confirm that this is not possible. We do not have any wireless process.Physical manipulation is also totally ruled out as there are multiple layers of security as well as several layers of self-check features.16 lakh VVPAT machines have been sanctioned and money has been received by the EC for this. The amount we have got is over Rs. 3,000 crores."
"Support for Emmanuel Macron's party grows before French parliamentary election: Poll","http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/support-for-emmanuel-macrons-party-grows-before-french-parliamentary-election-poll-1695142","Paris:                             Support for French President Emmanuel Macron's new centrist party is growing before legislative elections next month, a poll found on Thursday, raising the chances that he will be able to win parliamentary backing for his reform plans.A Harris Interactive poll found Macron's Republic on the Move party, together with allies, set to win the largest share of the vote in the first round of the National Assembly elections on June 11.Thirty-two percent of 4,600 registered voters questioned planned to vote for Macron's party, it said.That was up three points from a similar poll on May 11 and up six points from a poll on May 7, the day that Macron defeated far-right leader Marine Le Pen to become French president.Macron, 39, who smashed the traditional left-right grip on French politics to win the presidency, gave ministerial jobs to conservatives, socialists and political newcomers on Wednesday, appointing an unprecedented all-stripes cabinet to bridge divides and broaden his support.In a morning radio interview, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe dismissed a suggestion that the mixed government was an electoral gimmick, saying 'progress' was its unifying theme.""Clearly it is a government built to last,"" he told France Inter. ""As the legislatives approach, this (government) is of course essential, and will determine everything that happens afterwards. But the government is here to govern. It is here to prepare the recovery, it is here to create something, it is here to put projects in place.""The new cabinet will meet for the first time on Thursday.Under the French voting system, if no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round of voting for the National Assembly, the leading candidates go forward to a second round on June 18. The Harris poll gave no forecast of what would happen then or how many seats each party might win.But the poll's findings strengthen the chances that Macron will be able to count on parliamentary backing for his plans, which include corporate tax cuts, labour market reforms, and a 50 billion euro investment plan coupled with public spending savings.The Harris poll for French television found support for the centre-right The Republicans and the far-right National Front both on 19 percent, each down one point from the May 11 poll.Support for the far-left France Unbowed party rose a point to 15 percent while the Socialist Party's backing fell by a point to six percent.The online poll was carried out between May 15 and 17 - after Macron named conservative lawmaker Edouard Philippe as his prime minister and before the new government was unveiled on Wednesday.Six French voters out of 10 hope that Macron will have a majority in parliament, the Harris poll found.Macron's party announced a list of 428 candidates, most of them political unknowns, last Thursday to fight the parliamentary elections.But the party, which currently has no seats in the National Assembly, has yet to pick dozens of other candidates for the 577 seats at stake, hoping more politicians from other parties will switch sides.© Thomson Reuters 2017

"MCD Election Results 2017: A Trademark PM Modi Tactic, Used To Win Delhi, Could Repeat In Gujarat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/a-trademark-pm-modi-tactic-used-to-win-delhi-could-repeat-in-gujarat-1686289","New Delhi: HighlightsBJP fielded fresh faces in Delhi polls, dropped most sitting councillors
Party might replicate strategy in Gujarat assembly polls later this year
BJP performed extensively well in the UP elections last month
                                The BJP's standout strategy for the Delhi civic polls was the decision to drop almost all sitting councilors and field fresh faces. It did this to skirt an anti-incumbency sentiment amid allegations of corruption and non-performance in the three corporations, which it has dominated for years. The party's campaign stressed that it was bringing in fresh faces and fresh energy.

It worked. The BJP has won all three municipalities with a bigger margin than last time, and there is already talk about whether the party will look at replicating the strategy in the next big election it faces - the Gujarat assembly elections due at the end of this year. But, Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi's tweet today notes, the strategy was originally applied in Gujarat by then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

""Narendra bhai had once replaced all Councillers in Guj & won 2/3 seats in local elections. Same strategy worked in MCD,"" Bihar's Mr Modi tweeted. PM Modi, as Chief Minister of Gujarat for 13 years, had in fact made it a practice to not field many sitting legislators in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 assembly elections too. In 2012, the BJP had dropped 40 per cent of its legislators opting for new candidates. Each time it won big.

The BJP has been in power in Gujarat for more than 19 years and could need to fall back upon the Modi strategy more than ever in the face of a build-up of the anti-incumbency factor. The party has struggled with containing the massive Patel agitation for reservation in government jobs and colleges and had a scare in 2015 when the Congress made inroads in rural areas in local body elections.

The BJP's superlative performance in the Uttar Pradesh elections last month - it won more than 300 of the state's 403 seats - has energised the party cadre in Gujarat as has an early start to its election campaign with both PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah making frequent visits to the state.
 BJP celebrations in Uttar Pradesh after the party emerged victorious in the state in the seven-phased assembly polls, that were held in February this year.Elections are also due next year in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, two other states where the BJP has been in power for some time now. Also in Rajasthan. The party could deny ticket to several legislators seen to have not performed, say sources.

A move like the one in Delhi to field fresh new faces will send out a message to the party's parliamentarians and legislators in other states that their selection to contest elections is not automatic, they will have to perform.

From crucial Uttar Pradesh, which sent 71 BJP lawmakers to parliament in the 2014 national elections, there have been complaints about the non-performance of MPs. The Prime Minister has reminded them at meetings that work must be done in their constituencies to electrify villages and implement central government schemes. With a BJP government now in the state they will also not have recourse to complaints about a non-cooperative state government.

There is now immense pressure on the party to deliver on promises. For PM Modi's bid for a second term in 2019, a repeat of the party's 2014 performance in UP is crucial."
"Not Joining BJP, Says Gujarat Congress Leader Who 'Unfollowed' Rahul Gandhi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/not-joining-bjp-says-congress-leader-shankersinh-vaghela-after-he-unfollows-rahul-gandhi-on-twitter-1693838","Ahmedabad:                             Gujarat Congress leader Shankarsinh Vaghela today said his ""unfollowing"" party vice president Rahul Gandhi on Twitter does not signal a return to the BJP. He has described his decision to do so - he stopped following not only Mr Gandhi but everyone else - as a move towards winding down activity on social media ahead of the Gujarat assembly elections later this year.

This, Mr Vaghela explained to reporters on Monday, was necessary to stop ""spreading of false messages and speculation"" about him; it was ""not personal"" he said. The 76-year-old is in fact seen to be sulking with his party after it said it will not project any one as presumptive Chief Minister. Mr Vaghela's supporters have been pushing for the Congress to project him for Gujarat Chief Minister.  

The former Chief Minister waited a full day after his Twitter move before making the clarification. In that time, there was much speculation about his return to the BJP, especially after his recent meeting with the party's president Amit Shah, who too is from Gujarat. He had also skipped an event organised by the state Congress' IT cell yesterday.

On Twitter, as Mr Vaghela spring-cleaned his account, he also deleted all anti-BJP posts from his account. And he did not touch a pinned tweet from April that praises Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a one-time friend turned rival. ""I appreciate @narendramodi for removing red beacons. This was something I had implemented during my chief minister tenure in 1996-97,"" Mr Vaghela had tweeted, commenting on PM Modi's decision to ban VIPs from the lal batti or red beacon on their cars.

""I am already active in the Congress...you should not worry that I will go anywhere else,' Mr Vaghela said today.

Ashok Gehlot, the Congress' Gujarat chief, had last week at a party meeting said, ""There are rumours again and again about Shankersinh Vaghela joining the BJP. Why don't you just ask him.""

Mr Gehlot asserted that the Congress is not splitting months ahead of the elections, when it hopes to dislodge the BJP after 20 years of ruling Gujarat. The party, which has lost a series of assembly elections in different states to the BJP in recent months, can ill-afford a rebellion by Mr Vaghela. 36 of the Congress' 57 legislators demanded last month that he be projected for Chief Minister if the Congress wants to win the Gujarat elections. Mr Gehlot had ruled out that out.

Shankersinh Vaghela was in the BJP for many years and shared a close bond with PM Modi, going back to their days together in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). They, however, fell out when Mr Vaghela was sidelined for Chief Minister. He quit the BJP and launched his own party, before joining the Congress."

Mr Gehlot replaced Gurudas Kamat, who has handled the party's affairs till now. Mr Kamat has had internal problems within the party in Maharashtra after the Congress' debacle in state civic polls.

The Congress has revamped the entire team in Gujarat by replacing the general secretary incharge and appointing four new secretaries.

""Congress President Sonia Gandhi has assigned the task of looking after Gujarat affairs to a new AICC team that includes general secretary incharge Ashok Gehlot and four new AICC secretaries,"" AICC general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said.

Among the new four All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretaries appointed for Gujarat affairs include former Youth Congress chief Rajeev Satav, Harshvardhan Sapkal, Varsha Gaikwad and Jeetu Patwari.

The Congress is working overtime to put its act together and put up a stiff fight to the BJP in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The BJP president will be present at Ravidas Ashram, under New Delhi Parliamentary constituency, to listen to PM Modi's monthly radio address to the nation on Sunday, 11 AM, said party vice-president and Delhi unit in-charge Shyam Jaju.

""We have instructed our party workers to connect people with Mann Ki Baat and get them to listen to it. Our party president will visit Ravidas Ashram under the same programme,"" Mr Jaju told PTI.

Delhi BJP leaders said that the party chief will also interact with locals and learn their hardships and problems.

""The party has promised to provide housing facilities to all by 2022. The policy of 'Jahan Jhuggi Wahin Makan' given by BJP will be boosted by Shah's visit as he could advise the Centre about it,"" said a senior Delhi BJP leader.

The party president may also have lunch with the local people during the visit, he added.

The recent victory of BJP in the MCD polls was attributed to Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari's connect with residents of unauthorised colonies, slums and rural parts of the city.

Mr Tiwari who had spent new year's eve at Inderpuri slum after assuming charge of Delhi BJP unit in November last year, has launched a programme of developing slums into 'model dwellings' on the lines of Adarsh Gram Yojna.

Another party leader and Union minister Vijay Goel too has come out with his 'Adopt A Slum' scheme under which the municipal councillors will adopt and develop slums in their wards.

The massive victory of BJP in MCD polls, has rekindled the party's hope of recapturing power in Delhi by repeating the feat in next Assembly elections due in 2020.

A tussle has been reported widely between Mr Tiwari and Mr Goel over the leadership in Delhi, although the two met recently to settle their misunderstandings as per instructions of the party leadership.

Delhi BJP leaders including Mr Tiwari maintained a distance from Goel's 'Slum Yuva Daud' held today at DU marking launch of his 'Adopt A Slum' campaign, despite the national leadership's instructions to support the programme."
"EVMs Used In Uttarakhand Polls To Be Seized, Says High Court","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/evms-used-in-uttarakhand-polls-to-be-taken-in-judicial-custody-court-1686637","Nainital: HighlightsEVMs used in Vikasnagar constituency to be taken into judicial custody
Congress' Nav Prabhat had alleged tampered EVMs helped BJP candidate win
Election Commission has strongly denied claims of EVM rigging so far
                                Electronic Voting Machines or EVMs used for the Vikasnagar constituency in the Uttarakhand assembly elections earlier this year will be taken in court's custody, the state's High Court has ruled, as it admitted a petition by a Congressman who lost the election from that seat.

Senior Uttarakhand Congress leader, Nav Prabhat, has challenged the election of the BJP's Munna Singh Chauhan from Vikasnagar, near capital Dehradun, alleging that the EVMs were rigged. 

Opposition parties have alleged that the BJP's landslide win in Uttarakhand and neighbouring key state Uttar Pradesh last month was aided by tampered EVMs. The Election Commission has emphatically said EVMs cannot be rigged. 

The Uttarakhand High Court has asked the Election Commission, the state poll panel and Mr Chauhan to send their replies within six weeks to notices that it served today. It has also asked the election commissions not to use the Vikasnagar EVMs for any elections till it issues further orders. The EVMs have not been used since the Uttarkahand elections since vote machines deployed for an election are not used again for at least two months after results are announced. 

About 11,000 EVMs were used for the elections for Uttarakhand's 70 assembly seats; 139 EVM sets were used in Vikasnagar.

The BJP swept the hill state winning 57 seats, and the Congress has won 11. In Vikasnagar, Mr Chauhan beat Mr Nav Prabhat by a margin of more than 6,000 votes.

The Congress and other opposition parties have raised the EVM controversy in parliament and outside demanding that future elections be held on paper ballot. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had sought that paper ballots be used for municipal elections in Delhi and several of its leaders have attributed the BJP's huge win in results announced yesterday to ""manipulated EVMs"".

The BJP has dismissed the allegations, calling its rivals poor losers. It has also asked the Congress why it has not questioned EVMs in Punjab, the only state it won in the assembly elections held in five states. Mr Kejriwal has, however, alleged tampering of EVMs in the Punjab election, in which his AAP fared poorly."
"Stay Humble, Don't Get Complacent: Amit Shah To BJP Workers","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/stay-humble-dont-get-complacent-amit-shah-to-bjp-workers-1688813","Lucknow:                             Stay humble and do not get complacent, BJP national president Amit Shah told party workers on Tuesday, while attributing to them its overwhelming victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

The party workers should not feel relaxed and complacent after the BJP's win in UP. Instead, more efforts should be made to improve party's prospects on the assembly seats and booths where it is weak, Mr Shah said.

He was addressing the state executive meeting of the BJP on concluding day of its two-day meet, which was held for the first time after the saffron party stormed to power in the recent Assembly elections.

Terming the BJP as a ""party of patriots"", Mr Shah said, ""The party workers must not sit back and relax, but make efforts to reachout those booths, where it is weak and tell people about the various welfare schemes initiated by the Centre and state governments, thereby increasing the membership of the party.""

Noting that there were 16,000 workers in the BJP, he said if one party worker decides to strengthen five booths, then the party would automatically reach to 80,000 booths.

""The party workers must go the booth level and work with the dalits, the poor and the labourers, and tell them about the various welfare measures of the Centre and state government,"" he said.

The people should be told how the party came up with the 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra' before the UP assembly elections while working on 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas', Mr Shah said.

Lauding the hard work of party workers, he said, ""It is due to their toil that BJP which started as a 10-member party is now having 11 crore members, and is the largest political party in the world.""

""It is because of the hardwork of the party workers that the party has formed government on its own strength in 14 states, while it shares power with allies in three states,"" he said.

The party has 282 MPs in Lok Sabha and 1,387 MLAs throughout the country, he pointed out.

""But, the party workers should not feel relaxed or complacent and take steps to ensure that BJP makes inroads to each and every part of India,"" he said.

After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, people of UP wanted to get rid of casteism, dynastic politics and appeasement, and they have given a green signal by voting for the BJP, heralding a new era in the state, he said, and added that UP had been suffering from policy paralysis all these years.

""It is for these reasons that the BJP did not name its election yatras as 'Vijay Yatra' but called them 'Parivartan Yatra'. Our main aim was to help UP get free from the 15 years of misrule of SP and BSP. The Yogi government will do 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas', and we are seeing glimpses of this in the first few months,"" he added."
"In Congress Stronghold, Amit Shah Sets 150-Seat Target For BJP In Gujarat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amit-shahs-simple-formula-for-setting-150-seat-target-for-bjp-in-gujarat-1706409","Chota Udepur, Gujarat: HighlightsTarget is to win 150 of Gujarat's 182 seats: BJP chief Amit Shah
Amit Shah covered 3 booths in a door to door campaign in Devaliya village
The tribal vote matters in 27 of the state's constituencies
                                Workers of the BJP will fan out in 48,000 booths to reach the maximum number of people before assembly elections Gujarat, as the party seeks to retain the state for the sixth time.  The target is to win 150 of Gujarat's 182 seats, said BJP chief Amit Shah on Wednesday, offering a simple formula.  

""We won 120 seats when Narendrabhai was Chief Minister. Now when he is Prime Minister, we should win 150,"" Mr Shah said. 

The BJP chief was in Devaliya village in the tribal belt of Chota Udepur in central Gujarat and covered three booths in a door to door campaign. The area is seen as a Congress stronghold and Mr Shah told party workers, ""Whatever seats we win or lose, we must not lose from Devaliya...I have myself come amidst you to motivate you."" 

With elections now six months away, the BJP strategically chose the tribal area for the party president to kick off the booth management campaign. The powerful Patels who have traditionally supported the BJP are miffed with the ruling party over their demand for reservation in government jobs and colleges not being met. As it looks to consolidate the support if other communities, the 15 per cent tribal vote can be a crucial addition. 

The tribal vote matters in 27 of the state's constituencies.

As he has done in recent tours of other states, Amit Shah had lunch at the home of a resident of Devaliya village Popat Vasava, whose family was ecstatic at getting to host the BJP president. Their home has a brand new toilet added recently right at the entrance and a permanent gas connection. 

Food for the BJP chief was cooked on a gas stove and not a chullal or coal stove. Mr Vasava denied that these were recent gifts linked to the VIP visit. ""We got the toilet made about a month back from government grant. And we got the gas connection under the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category,"" he said. 

Gujarat is the home state of both Mr Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was Chief Minister for 13 years before he moved to Delhi after the BJP won the 2014 national elections.  The party has since won a series of state elections and has started an early campaign to also retain Gujarat. Apart from the BJP's traditional rival in the state, the Congress, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party too is contesting in the state."

"UP Elections 2017: Not Religion Or Caste, Bareilly Votes For Jobs","http://www.ndtv.com/assembly/up-elections-2017-not-religion-or-caste-bareilly-votes-for-jobs-1659760","BAREILLY:                             Ravi Singh Rawat expected to land a white-collar job once he graduated. But the student of economics who spoke fluent English, found jobs were not easy to come by. After three years of futile search, the 24-year-old ended up working in a small motorcycle repair shop in Bareilly's Civil Lines.

""""I was one of the brightest in my class but there are no jobs... I don't like doing this, but I have a family to feed. I had to do something,"" he said, staring at his grease-stained hands and dirty work clothes.

That is the story of many in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly, the state's seventh-largest city which votes on Wednesday. In 2015, when the Akhilesh Yadav government advertised for 368 peons, it received nearly 23 lakh applications. Every tenth was from a graduate or a post-graduate, and more than 200 aspirants were research scholars.

Tackling unemployment among the educated young men and women has been a challenge that successive governments in state capital Lucknow - including the Samajwadi Party government -- have been unable to face up to.

It is a point the leaders of the BJP - which hadn't been in power in the state for more than 20 years -- have rubbed in over the last few weeks of campaign. In Bareilly, the party is competing with the ruling Samajwadi Party and its ally Congress for the same votebank. BJP candidate Arun Kumar had won the seat in 2012 and hopes to repeat his performance -- his party hopes to benefit from the divided votes.

But the ban on high-value currency notes in November to flush out black money - a move the BJP claims has huge support from the people -- appears to have created some difficulties in small towns like Bareilly. It has further shrunk employment opportunities in a state that is now estimated to have over one crore unemployed people in the 15 to 35 year age group.

Many flourishing businesses in Bareilly - once known for its furniture and woven cots - are on the verge of a collapse. ""I haven't been able to source raw-material, can't pay my labourers,"" said Abdul Rafeek, whose family has been making cots for four generations.

A young furniture labour, Amit Sharma too blames demonetisation for the decline in his income. ""We have lost 70% of our business due to the notes ban. There was a time when I didn't have money to buy milk for the house,"" he says.

A daily wager at a transport company, Raje agrees. ""My earnings of Rs 300 have been reduced to Rs 150 all because of demonetisation... There is no work! Where do we go?"" he says. ""This election is neither on religion, nor on caste. We shall vote only for employment,"" he says."

Over 826 candidates from 105 political parties, including 6 national parties, 7 state parties, 92 unrecognised parties and 225 independent candidates are contesting for the 69 assembly seats of the 12 districts in the third phase. 

However, the key parties to watch out for in these elections are BJP, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress. 

Over 250 crorepati candidates are in the fray for the third phase. Of these 61 candidates belong to the BJP. Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party is close second with 56 candidates. The ruling Samajwadi Party has fielded 51 crorepati candidates. Meanwhile, Congress which has an alliance with the Samajwadi Party has 7 crorepati candidates for the third phase of assemble polls.

Anup Kumar Gupta of the Samajwadi Party is the richest candidate with assets worth over Rs 42 crore. Ajay Kapoor of Congress (Rs 31 crore) and Seema Sachan from Samajwadi Party (Rs 29 crore) are the other two richest candidates, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) said.

More than 2.4 crore voters will vote for 826 candidates contesting the elections.

"UP Elections 2017: BJP Bets On Man Who Ended Its Winning Streak In Allahabad","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjp-bets-on-man-who-ended-its-winning-streak-in-allahabad-1660382","Allahabad:                             An industrialist-turned-party-hopping politician has been fielded by BJP in Allahabad South assembly segment with the hope that the man who had ended its winning streak in the constituency a decade ago as a BSP man, might now wrest the seat from SP.

On February 23, when voters of the constituency will exercise their franchise, 43-year-old Nand Gopal Gupta ""Nandi"" shall be looking forward to avenging the defeat of 2012 at the hands of sitting Samajwadi Party MLA Haji Parvez, to whom he had lost by a slender margin of less than 400 votes.

While Mr Gupta is the BJP candidate this time, the BSP - which expelled him three years ago - has fielded Mashooq Khan as part of a strategy to give a substantial number of tickets to those belonging to minority community.

 The Congress, which Mr Gupta had joined upon his expulsion from BSP and quit only last month, will end up supporting Mr Parvez owing to its alliance with the Samajwadi Party.

Mr Gupta's electoral debut in 2007 had caused the BJP to lose its grip over the assembly segment which it had never lost since 1989.

'Nandi' had defeated, by a margin of more than 14,000 votes, Keshri Nath Tripathi who was a five-time MLA, and had served thrice as the Uttar Pradesh assembly Speaker and was the BJP's state unit president at that time.

Emerging as the proverbial dark horse in an electoral contest that was being viewed as a ""clash of titans"", 'Nandi' had humbled Tripathi and relegated Rita Bahuguna Joshi, then the Congress woman's wing president and its future state unit chief, to the position of a distant third.

Interestingly, Mr Joshi, too, is contesting the current elections on a BJP ticket, from the Lucknow Cantt seat.

The BJP could not recover from the upset it suffered in 2007 as Tripathi finished third in the electoral contest five years later.

He has now moved out of the state on a gubernatorial assignment."

Sunday was also the third phase of polling for UP Assembly elections
Her in-laws agreed to delay the ceremony so the bride could vote
                                Every vote counts. In every election – state or general. And this bindaas bride from Lucknow knows it.

Manisha Kashyap, who got married on Saturday, February 18 in Lucknow, decided to delay her bidaai ceremony so she could vote in the February 19 polls instead.

The bidaai ceremony traditionally marks the end of a Hindu wedding ceremony and is when a bride officially ‘leaves’ her home and family behind.

Assembly elections are currently being held in Manisha’s home state of Uttar Pradesh and Sunday marked the third phase of polling. Elections across the state are being conducted in seven phases. The votes will finally be counted on March 11.

""A few Election Commission officials visited us and made us aware,"" Manisha explained. ""That’s why I decided to do this.""

So Manisha’s bidaai ceremony will now take place a few days after her wedding, on February 21, instead of the day after, February 19, as is usually done.

The best thing is that Manisha’s in-laws are totally on board with her decision. ""My in-laws fully support this decision,"" she said proudly.

""There is a message for the whole nation - that every daughter, every son and all citizens should exercise their right to vote,"" the bride's father told news agency ANI.

And Manisha is not the only one to choose to do her democratic duty on her big day.

Another pair of newlyweds were spotted casting their vote in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh.

The voter is India's former Prime Minister and BJP co-founder Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who has represented the city of Nawabs five times in the Lok Sabha from 1991 to 2009. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh is the incumbent parliamentarian from Lucknow.

Mr Vajpayee, 92, has been suffering from age-related ailments and has not been seen in public for years.

""The last time Atal Bihar Vajpayee voted was in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, which was also the last election he ever contested. Thereafter, he could not vote in the assembly elections of 2007, 2012 as well as the Lok Sabha elections of 2009 and 2014,"" said Shiv Kumar, a close aide of the ailing leader, to news agency Press Trust of India.

He added that this time too, the former Prime Minister ""would be unable to cast his vote in the ongoing polls"".

BJP state spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi, commenting on Mr Vajpayee, said, ""Though Atalji would not be able to cast his vote for the party candidate, his blessings are always with us. With this, we would surge ahead in the electoral battlefield.""

Atal Bihar Vajpayee is a former three-time Prime Minister of India. His first term lasted for 13 days in 1996. His second term lasted from 1998 to 1999 whereas his third term came between 1999 and 2004. The BJP patriarch is the first non-Congress leader to complete a full-term as Prime Minister. Mr Vajpayee also holds the distinction of being the first Indian leader to deliver a speech in Hindi at the UN General Assembly. He was conferred the Bharat Ratna in 2014 by President Pranab Mukherjee, who broke protocol to present him with the award at his residence.

The former Chief Minister cast her vote in poll booth number 251 in Lucknow. She also addressed the media after casting her vote and urged voters of the 12 districts to cast their ballots in large numbers.

""Firstly, I would like to urge each and every voter in the third phase to come out and cast their ballot in their respective polling booths,"" she said.

Ms Mayawati further stated that she was confident of the Bahujan Samaj Party's victory in the Uttar Pradesh election.

""Two phases of the election have already been held and on that basis, I can confidently say that BSP will secure the maximum seats in the third phase.We will emerge as the single largest party with at least 300 seats,"" the Rajya Sabha member said.

Ms Mayawati also took a potshot at her rivals - the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP.

""We don't build castles in the air like the Samajwadi Party, Congress or the BJP,"" she jibed.

""People are turning out in large numbers at my rallies. They are sick of the Samajwadi Party's goondaraj and jungleraaj. Uttar Pradesh wants an environment of peace. Even the BJP has failed to fulfill even a fourth of their Lok Sabha promises,"" she added.  

Ms Mayawati seeks to become a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh after being in the opposition for five years. Her party performed dismally in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where it failed to win a single seat. This time, the BSP has fielded a record number of Muslim candidates to win over the community, which is seen as a major votebank of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress."

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also shared the dais to extend support to her brother and Congress workers. Ms Vadra's entry in the campaign came after Union Minister Smriti Irani said that the Congress' star campaigner was trying to avoid ""people's questions"" about the ""unfulfilled promises"" of the Congress.

The Congress has forged an alliance with the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state and much of the credit for this alliance was accorded to Ms Vadra. While Ms Vadra has refused to play a pro-active role in politics, she has campaigned for her mother and brother in their respective parliamentary constituencies - Raebareli and Amethi - in the past.  

Scheduled for 19 February, the third phase will witness polls in 69 constituencies spread across 12 districts. The third phase will also see heavyweights contest the polls in Lucknow, Kanpur, Kannauj, Etawah among others.

Here are the highlights of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's speech in Raebareli:A few months ago, Congress took out a 30-day long yatra in Uttar Pradesh.We spoke to farmers about their issues.The farmers said three things: Rain, hail and Modiji doesn't give us compensations.They want loans to be waived, electricity rates halved and the right price for our produce.Two crore farmers reached out to us.I went to PM Modi and I said you have forgone debts of rich industrialists. You may do that as you are the Prime Minister. But you should also think of the farmers of Uttar Pradesh.And his response? Not one word about farmers and their debts.While campaigning in Uttar Pradesh, he said, ""As soon as you elect the BJP, we will waive off your loans"".What kind of deal are you trying to strike here?The Congress had waived off farmers' loans, even when it wasn't in power.Same thing happened to Bihar. He promised a special package of lakhs of crorers to them if they elected the BJP.Did Bihar get the package? No.Wherever he goes, he says these things.Like Shah Rukh Khan in his film, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, he promised Acche Din.But 2.5 years later, we see Gabbar Singh from Sholay.While campaigning, he promised to change Varanasi. He called it his mother.Modiji, relationships are not fulfilled with talks but actions.I have a list of things that he promised Varanasi - clean Ganga, Ghats, Ring Road, free WiFi, Bhojpuri Film City.Modiji, you have not even fulfilled the promises you made to your mother.I urge friends from the media to go there. I know you are under pressure, but please do your job. Show us if the film city has been built.This is Modiji's approach to things. He said: India is dirty. You clean up. I have to go to America and meet Obama. I'll check when I'm back.On November 8, he stood before you and said, ""I have a new idea.""He told you that the savings that mothers and sisters have saved up, I want to convert it to paper. You should go stand in queues in front of banks.After notes ban, Modiji waived 1,200 crore of Vijay Mallya's loans.You tell me: If this money was given to the youth, the women, the farmers - wouldn't it have helped Uttar Pradesh? But instead, he helped rich industrialists.We wanted to build a food park here, set up 40 factories.Why? Because today, farmers sell their produce to mandis. We wanted to sell them directly to factories so that they get the right price for what they produce.The peppermint from here would have gone all over the world. The US President would eat a mint and it would read, 'Made in Raebareli'.All this, despite the 'Make in India' program.The reality is that the only ones benefitting from PM Modi's schemes are India's richest families.Forget 'Make in India', he has snatched away 'Made in Raebareli' from you. That is because he wanted to take revenge.He has stalled the Railway factory, not letting it go ahead.In just Rs 20,000, you can change lives of families here. But no, you won't give them money.You will money to chors like Vijay Mallya.Mallya sells liquor in India. You will give him thousands of crores. The farmer who gives you his sweat and blood - you don't even give them Rs 50. What kind of a government is this?We will help the small entrepreneurs. We will give them all the loans they want. On he condition that they employ 200-300 people.Tell me, how many people has Mallya given jobs to?If you vote for Congress-Samajwadi Party, it will be a government for farmers and women."

""Although leaders of parties like BJP and SP-Congress alliance are making tall claims of support coming their way, people only have faith on 'tried and tested' BSP leadership as they know she (Mayawati) believes in saying and doing the same thing and will fulfil the promise on ending 'Jungleraj' and bringing rule of law after coming to power,"" she added.

"UP Elections 2017: Yadav Takeover Of State Police? Not At All, Say Yadavs","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-yadav-takeover-of-state-police-not-at-all-say-yadavs-1661570","Etawah:                             Law and order in Uttar Pradesh has been one of the main targets of the BJP in this assembly election in the state. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken of what his party alleges is the Yadav takeover of the state police. He had also spoken of discrimination, which he called the biggest problem of the state. Three days ago, at a rally in Barabanki, PM Modi said, ""Akhilesh-ji has turned police stations into Samajwadi Party offices. If you go to a police station, you will find the inspector and you will find 5-6 goondas"".

At the high-profile Saifai police station in the Yadav stronghold Etawah, Gopal Singh Yadav -- the latest in a two-decade list of Yadav in-charges, with just a few exceptions -- refuses to discuss the merit of his 2-month-old posting.

But six men sitting on the porch of the police station, sipping tea, say they are more than willing to discuss the merits of the Prime Minister's allegation. The men, who came to the police station to pay a courtesy call, are from the adjoining Zafarpur gram panchayat. Three of them are Samajwadi Party leaders and all are Yadavs.  

""Modi is not saying the right thing. If someone is talented, he can get posted anywhere. Whoever is talented, he or she will go... whatever the department is. What jobs have Modi given?"" questions Uttam Yadav, who is in his early 20s.

There aren't any hard numbers in the public domain to support the BJP, or even Mayawati's allegations that Yadavs are being favoured in postings and recruitment in the state police. If it has had an effect on policing, there is just one number: In 2015, UP recorded the highest crime rate against Dalits across the country at over 8,300 incidents.

On Sunday, at his Fatehpur rally in Bundelkhand, PM Modi had also spoken of discrimination, calling it the state's biggest problem. ""If you ask any Dalit whether they get opportunity, they say it's given to the Other Backward Castes and if you ask OBCs, they will say it's only given to Yadavs,"" he had said.

At Etawah's Rai Nagar village, a few kilometres from Saifai, a group of Jatav or Scheduled Caste villagers -- traditional Mayawati supporters -- second the claim.

Dharmendra Kumar, 23, says he appeared for police entrance exams in 2013, but did not get through. ""If I were a Yadav, I would have got through. My friend got into the Lekhpal's written exam. Because he was not a Yadav, he was not selected in the viva,"" says Dharmendra, even though he admits that he has no evidence to back his claims. ""Everything is based on caste considerations. If Modi comes here, at least things will be better.""

""Mayawati has said many times that if there has been any favouritism in recruitments there will be an inquiry,"" says Narendra Nath, the BSP candidate from Etawah.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has not reacted to charges so far. Instead, he has focused on the improvement in police delivery mechanisms including these first responders -- dial 100 cars."
"Manipur Elections 2017: Irom Sharmila, Okram Ibobi Singh File Nominations","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-chief-minister-files-nomination-1660186","Imphal:                             Activist Irom Sharmila and Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who is seeking a fourth term, today filed their nominations for Thoubal Assembly seat in the upcoming assembly elections.

Mr Ibobi Singh will fight on a Congress ticket. The chief minister said with conviction the Congress party would return with a ""thumping"" majority and would form the government for the fourth consecutive term.  

Sharmila filed her nominations on behalf of her People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA), which is making an electoral debut this year.

Anti-AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) crusader Irom Sharmila, who ended her 16-year-long hunger strike in August 2016, will be one of the main opponents against the Congress veteran in Thoubal. She reached Thoubal on her bicycle, covering a distance of over 20km from Imphal, flanked by her party activists. PRJA is hoping to make an impact using alternative political practices.

Mr Ibobi Singh, the three-time chief minister of Manipur, is eyeing for a fourth term in office after being elected successively in 2002, 2007 and 2012 respectively. ""The ruling Congress shall win absolute majority in the non-Naga areas. There are 10 seats in the constituencies dominated by the Nagas. We are hoping to bag at least half,"" he told the media.

Naga groups are reportedly staunchly opposed to the Congress party and Mr Ibobi Singh.

Many of the politicians were asked to resign from the assembly and contest only after joining other parties, said sources.

Polling for the 60-member Manipur Assembly will take place in two phases on March 4 and March 8 respectively, results for which will be declared on March 11.

"Manipur Election 2017: Poor Representation Of Women In Candidate Lists Of Political Parties","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-election-2017-poor-representation-of-women-in-candidate-lists-of-political-parties-1661089","Imphal:                             Though women voters outnumber men in the electoral rolls in Manipur, only a small number of them have featured in the candidate lists of political parties in the upcoming state Assembly elections in Imphal.

The total number of voters in the state is around 19 lakh and the number of women voters is much higher than that of men.Women play an important role in Manipuri society but the number of women candidates put up by the political parties is far less when compared to that of men, sources from Election Commission said.

The ruling Congress and the BJP which are the main contenders in the upcoming polls have fielded only two candidates each. The TMC which came out with a list 24 candidates also has two women candidates.

Human rights activist Irom Sharmila's Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA), contesting from three seats has fielded two women, including Sharmila herself.

The National People's Party (NPP) has fielded only one woman candidate out of their 21 total number of candidates.

A senior Congress leader of Manipur state Congress unit said, ""Actually we had only received applications from four women candidates. Only two were given tickets based on their ability to win the seats. And secondly, in Manipur, women are not very much interested in politics.""

Keeping aside their ideological and political differences, the views of Congress were echoed by BJP state unit on this issue.

""We had given tickets based on the winning ability of candidates. And women are not very much interested in politics,"" a senior state BJP leader said.

But PRJA and TMC had different views on why a small number of women found place in candidate list.

""Out of three candidates that we had fielded two are women. This shows our commitment towards women empowerment. But the candidate list of big parties like BJP and Congress show that they are not at all interested in women politics. Shame on them,"" Erendro Leichonbam of PRJA said.

The TMC on the other hand blamed politics of violence and intimidation as the main reason behind the party not fielding women candidates.

""We wanted to field more women candidates. But we couldn't as there is a reign of terror and women are afraid to come out,"" TMC's leader in-charge of Manipur elections Samrat Tapadar told PTI.

In the outgoing state assembly, there are only three women MLAs and one of them is a minister in the state ministry.

Polling for the 60 seat Manipur Assembly will take place in two phases on March 4 and March 8 and the results will be declared on March 11."
"UP Elections 2017: BJP Gained 'Decisive Lead' In First Phase, Says Kalraj Mishra","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjp-gained-decisive-lead-in-first-phase-says-kalraj-mishra-1659806","Allahabad:                             Senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra today claimed his party has gained a ""decisive lead"" in the first of the seven-phased Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls.

Mr Mishra also hit out at the alliance between Samajwadi Party and Congress, saying that the alliance will ""fall apart soon after its defeat"".

""To save itself from a drubbing in the polls, Samajwadi party has formed an alliance with the Congress. It was an act of desperation. This opportunistic coalition will fall apart soon after its defeat,"" Mr Mishra said.

""Criminals have ruled the roost during Akhilesh Yadav's tenure as the Chief Minister and it is amusing to hear his platitudes about development and women's empowerment. Murder and loot take place in broad daylight and rapes have become commonplace,"" the BJP leader alleged.

""The BJP has gained a decisive lead in the first phase of the Assembly polls held last week. This has sent all our opponents into a tizzy. The trend will continue in the second phase of polling which is underway today and also in the remaining five phases and BJP will form government in the state,"" he asserted.

Mr Mishra, who was in Allahabad to campaign in support of BJP candidates in various Assembly segments, claimed the Narendra Modi government has granted assistance of ""more than Rs. 7 lakh
crore"" to Uttar Pradesh so far.

""Would the corrupt government in the state tell the people what it did with the funds,"" the Union Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Minister said.

""Akhilesh have been bragging about the Lucknow-Agra Expressway and Lucknow Metro, showcasing them as his own achievements. He should have the decency to admit that the entire funds for these two projects were provided by the Centre,"" Mr Mishra said."
"UP Election 2017: Voting For Phase-III Begins In 69 Constituencies","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-crucial-3rd-phase-of-polls-today-1660984","Lucknow:                             The third phase of assembly polls began today in Uttar Pradesh for 69 seats across 12 districts. A total of 2.41 crore voters will decide the fate of 826 candidates. There are 1.31 crore men, 1.1 crore women and 1,026 voters from the third gender who are expected to vote this time, a poll official said. There are 16,671 polling centres and 25,603 polling stations in this phase. The 12 districts where polling began at 7 am are Farrukhabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, Hardoi, Kannauj, Kanpur rural, Kanpur city, Unnao, Lucknow, Barabanki, Auraiyya and Sitapur.

Prominent personalities whose fate would be decided in this phase include Ministers Arvind Singh 'Gop', Fareed Mehfooz Kidwai, Vijay Bahadur Pal, Abhishek Mishra, Nitin Agarwal, Narendra Verma, Rajeev Kumar Singh and former Minister and  Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's estranged uncle, Shivpal Singh Yadav. A contest between Aparna Yadav and Rita Bahuguna Joshi in Lucknow Cantonment constituency is to watch out for.

The maximum number of candidates in fray are from Etawah (21) -- the home town of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, while the least number is in Haidergarh (3) assembly constituency of Barabanki, neighbouring the state capital.

Lucknow Central and Lucknow West have 17 candidates each, while Farrukhabad and Bhojpur have 20 each.

The third phase comes as the biggest litmus test for the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) as it held 55 of these 69 seats in the 2012 assembly polls.

Of the remaining seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) held six, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) five and Congress two in the last election. One seat was won by an independent.

Other than the stronghold of Etawah, which is the home turf of the Yadav clan, the popularity of Akhilesh Yadav is also up for test, especially after the ugly power struggle that was witnessed over the past few months in the state's first family and the ruling party.

Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav has not campaigned for the SP which he founded 25 years ago.

Sullen at his unceremonious ouster by son Akhilesh Yadav in January from the post of national president, Mulayam Singh has only sought votes for his younger brother Shivpal Yadav, who is contesting from the Jaswantnagar seat in Etawah and daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, who is a candidate from Lucknow Cantonment."

Targeting Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he said that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party have entered into an ""unholy alliance"".

""Two families have entered into an unholy alliance. Initially, people were affected by one shahzada (prince), now it is two. One shahzada is giving pain to his mother, the other to his father,"" he said, attacking Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, who had a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav over the control over SP.

 He asked the voters to shun dynastic and caste-based politics, noting that everything in the state veered around one family.

""What has this family given you? There are problems for farmers while law and order machinery in the state has collapsed. There is acute shortage of water and medicines. What has this state government done for you?"" he asked.

""For the past 50 years, only one family is running the affairs of Amethi. Even then, this place is languishing behind other districts in terms of development,"" he said. 

Mr Gandhi represents Amethi in the Lok Sabha.

Reacting to Rahul Gandhi seeking a performance report from Prime Minister Narendra Modi after two-and-a-half years in office, the BJP chief said, ""We will give details of each and everything. But, tell me what has your family done for the country? People of Amethi are asking this question.""

In a jibe at Mr Gandhi, he advised him to remove his ""Italian curtains"" to have a better vision of things, in an apparent reference to his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi's Italian origin.

The Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh is being held in seven phases."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Heavy Weights Battling It Out In Phase 3","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-heavy-weights-battling-it-out-in-phase-3-1660765","New Delhi:                             The third phase of Uttar Pradesh's assembly elections sees a tight contest among Bharatiya Janata Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party- Congress alliance for 69 seats in the state's legislature. All the three sides have fielded 69 candidates for the seats. In the alliance, the Congress alone fields only nine candidates, the other 60 are represented by the ruling Samajwadi Party. After the relatively calm two phases, this phase is also expected to be calm as voters queue up to make their choice.

Among the candidates, contesting this Sunday, there are no heavyweights fielded from Mayawati's BSP. But, both BJP and SP will witness the test of fate for some of its most promising leaders. Lucknow cantonment sees a fierce contest between newcomer Aparna Yadav, the 'chhoti bahu' (younger daughter-in-law) of Mulayam Singh Yadav playing the field against popular seasoned politician Rita Bahuguna Joshi from the BJP. Although, Ms Joshi has been in politics for nearly two decades, it is only few months ago that she made the switch from Congress into the BJP.

Also contesting is Samajwadi Party heavyweight, Shivpal Singh Yadav, Mulayam Singh's brother. Mr Shivpal has been in the eye of the storm for the last few months as the family feud of the Yadav clan came in the public eye. He is contesting from Jaswantnagar, the place where the Samajwadi patriarch Mulayam held his first rally for this election.

The seven-phase assembly election in Uttar Pradesh remains crucial as it is the state that sends most number of Rajya Sabha members to the parliament.

The fourth phase of the election, scheduled for Thursday, will witness voters in 53 constituencies across 12 districts, including Raebareli, Allahabad and Jhansi. Yesterday, at a rally in Fatehpur, the Prime Minister had mocked Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for trying up with the Congress. He also took potshots at the ruling Samajwadi Party government for the lack of basic amenities such as electricity in the state. He also said that discrimination on basis of caste and religion is one of the biggest issues that plague Uttar Pradesh.

The high-octane assembly elections are currently underway in India's most populous state, which is expected to lay the groundwork for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While the Samajwadi Party seeks to retain the state, this time with the Congress, the BJP and the Mayawati-led BSP are fighting to make a comeback.

Here are the live updates of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech in Orai:Ram, Ram to everyone.I have had the good fortune of coming here over the years.The last time when I took the yatra from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, I had come here.You have come here in large numbers to bless the BJP, and I thank you.The election is not just about what the government or what minister will come to power. It is much bigger than that.UP's development is in tatters. But Bundelkhand has been hit the worst.Such governments have been elected in UP; they have destroyed you.SP, BSP, Congress - they are different sides of the same coin.Don't listen to them. Don't even listen to me. But ask your soul.Whoever has come to power, they have all robbed you.The BJP promises you: the next government will UP will have the provision to listen to Bundelkhand.Special measures will be taken to solve the problems of Bundelkhand.After the BJP government is formed in UP, a special board for Bundelkhand's development will be formed under the chief minister. A weekly record will be sought from it.At 8 pm on November 8, I said the ones who have looted the poor will have to pay back.Aren;t the SP and BSP staunch rivals? But I was amazed when all the opposition parties started speaking in one voice when I banned 500 and 1000 rupee notes and asked for records of black money hoarders.Behenji (Mayawati) said there was not enough planning. I asked her, planning by the government or you?She said a week should have been given. Had I done that, the people who looted would have vanished. The money would not have come to banks.Her problem is that she did not get enough time to prepare.Her question is why the accounts of her brother are being talked about. She accuses that it is so because of the elections.No, Behenji. It is because you deposited 100 crore just after the notes ban.BSP no longer Bahujan Samaj Party...it is now Behenji Sampatti Party"
"Midterm Polls In Maharashtra Inevitable, Says Sharad Pawar","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/midterm-polls-in-maharashtra-inevitable-says-sharad-pawar-1660978","Mumbai:                             Warning that midterm assembly elections in Maharashtra were ""inevitable"", Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar on Saturday said there was no question of his party propping up the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the state.

Mr Pawar told the media that he was even ready to put down his decision in writing and submit a copy to the Governor.

""I can right now give a letter to this effect and forward it to the Governor. But even Shiv Sena should submit a similar letter to him and make it public,"" Mr Pawar added, putting the ball in the Sena court over the fate of the government headed by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.

The Shiv Sena in the past few weeks has bitterly criticised the BJP in the state and at the Centre, saying the Maharashtra government was, ""on a notice period"", indicating it may withdraw support after the outcome of the civic elections on February 23.

Soon after the 2014 October assembly elections, the NCP had extended outside support to the BJP's minority government as Shiv Sena sat in the opposition for a month.

Around a month later, the Sena left the opposition benches to join the BJP as an ally.

The NCP chief had then justified its decision to provide external support to the BJP, ""in the interest of political stability and to avoid a fresh round of elections"".

In the past assembly elections, Maharashtra threw up a fractured house as all the main parties had contested separately and against each other.

Attacking the Centre for demonetisation, Mr Pawar said the November 8 move had resulted in massive losses in the farming sector and rural areas, besides job losses in the economy.

Questioning Mr Fadnavis's claims on the ""transparency agenda"", Mr Pawar demanded to know how the BJP could spend so much money on advertisements and publicity for the ongoing civic elections in Maharashtra.

Referring to a demand by the BJP to ban the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana Group of Publications for some days during the election period, Mr the NCP president said this indicated ""dictatorial"" attitude on the central government's part and expressed his opposition to it."

Third phase of Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh slated for February 19
                                Campaigning for her party - the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Union minister Smriti Irani took on Priyanka Gandhi, whose brother and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has teamed up with the Samajwadi Party and Akhilesh Yadav for the ongoing Assembly elections in the state. Speaking about the people of Amethi, a key constituency for the Congress, Ms Irani said that Priyanka Gandhi is not campaigning here because she cannot face the people and their questions. Ms Irani, who was addressing a press conference in Amethi, said that despite losing the Lok Sabha election from Amethi in 2014 to Rahul Gandhi she has been working regularly for the people of the constituency.

Priyanka Gandhi, however, has been avoiding to campaign in Amethi because of ""unfulfilled promises,"" Ms Irani said, claiming that ""Priyanka (Gandhi) wants to avoid people's questions.""

Speaking about Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi forming a Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance in the state, Ms Irani said, ""(Chief Minister) Akhilesh Yadav went with Congress because he was not confident.""

When asked whether she would be the BJP's chief ministerial candidate if the party comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, Ms Irani evaded the question by saying that currently every BJP worker is focusing on the job at hand and wants to see the BJP win.

Speaking about the BSP and its chief Mayawati's recent comments targeting the BJP, Ms Irani said that Ms Mayawati just wants to ""remain in headlines"".

Uttar Pradesh, which is scheduled to vote in seven phases, has already finished the first two phases of polling. The third phase is scheduled for February 19. The counting of votes will take place on March 11."

His remarks came after the BSP chief said that she would rather be in the opposition than form an alliance with BJP to form the government in Uttar Pradesh and accused the BJP of spreading rumours of a coalition with BSP.

The chief minister also asked policemen to vote for him, stating that his government gave maximum promotions and made recruitments in the force.

He, however, cautioned policemen against taking bribe and said anyone accepting money from the people would be tracked if any complaint was received on ""Dial UP 100"" platform.

Mr Yadav also highlighted schemes launched by his government for the welfare of the people and sought their support in the election.

The second phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly election is currently underway in 69 constituencies - including Saharanpur, Bijnor and Moradabad - across 15 districts."
"Remove PM, Ministers' Photographs From Official Websites, Election Commission Tells Centre","http://www.ndtv.com/assembly/remove-pm-ministers-photographs-from-official-websites-election-commission-tells-centre-1659941","NEW DELHI:                             The Election Commission has ordered the Centre to remove photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers from government websites, insisting that all references to political leaders in official websites violated the model code of conduct.

Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha has also been told to explain why the central government hadn't removed references to the politicians from its websites so far.

The code of conduct had come into force from 4 January when the panel announced the schedule for elections to the five states, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur. The polls are already over in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa and two of the seven phases in Uttar Pradesh have been completed. Manipur will go to polls in March.

The EC letter sent over the weekend recalled that the commission had specifically mandated ""removal of all references of ministers, politician or political parties available on central/state government's official website"" in January.

It realised that the Centre hadn't complied with its instruction when someone complained how the website of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - that was being implemented in Uttar Pradesh - gave the BJP an unfair advantage since it had PM Narendra Modi and Union Housing Minister M Venkaiah Naidu's pictures.

The panel told the government to not only fix this website but also ""ensure that websites of other ministries/departments"" do not contain such photographs.

A key objective of the code is to ensure a level playing field for all political parties contesting elections and cap the possibility of the ruling party using government resources to its advantage.

Years ago, this meant taking down - or covering - government hoardings with pictures of the ministers.

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha General elections, the commission ordered the NDA government to mask pictures of then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on hoardings along the National Highways. Eight years later, the poll panel told the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh to drape the chief minister's statues, and of the elephants - that are her party, BSP's election symbol - at Ambedkar parks in Lucknow and Noida.

The same principle was later applied in cyber space, and the rule to remove all references to politicians from official websites introduced. In UP, many district officers have suspended their local websites rather than go through the trouble of scanning individual webpages."

SP has insulted Ram Manohar Lohia by forging alliance with Congress: PM
Fatehpur will vote on February 23 in the fourth phase of assembly polls
                                Prime Minster Narendra Modi on Sunday attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, accusing his Samajwadi Party government of politics of religion and caste discrimination. He was campaigning in Fatehpur, as UP voted in other parts of the state in the third of seven phases of the assembly elections.

""In Uttar Pradesh, everyone feels that they are being discriminated and they are being denied their rights,"" the Prime Minister said at an election rally. ""If a village has a graveyard it should also have a cremation ground. If there's electricity on Ramzan, it should also be there on Diwali. There must be bijli (power) both on Eid and Holi... There should be no discrimination,"" he said, accusing the Samajwadi Party of minority appeasement.

In Akhilesh Yadav's tenure, PM Modi said, ""The Dalits complain that their share is given to the Other Backward Classes, who in turn point a finger towards Muslims and Yadavs, while Yadavs say that only the family people get the benefits.""

The Prime Minister pitched schemes of the centre which, he said, benefit everyone irrespective of caste or religion and accused the state government of corruption. No one can get jobs without recommendations or the bribe, he said, urging people to elect the BJP for a change.

The BJP, which had swept Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 General Elections winning 71 of its 80 seats, is hoping to follow that up with as big a win in these assembly elections, it has not been in power in the state for the last 15 years. Instead of fielding a candidate for the Chief Minister's post, it has built its campaign around PM Modi's appeal and his development mantra.

Sixty-nine assembly constituencies of Uttar Pradesh spread across 12 districts voted today in the third phase of the seven-phase assembly elections seen by many as a precursor to the 2019 national polls. Fatehpur will vote on February 23 in the fourth phase."
"Manipur Elections 2017: Why Targeting The Young Voters Will Be Key","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-why-targeting-the-young-voters-will-be-key-1661599","Imphal:                             Campaigning is gaining momentum in Manipur, where the ruling Congress - which has been in power for 15 years - is locked in a battle for survival against the BJP which has made inroads in this Congress bastion. In all the 60 seats of Manipur, a key factor for winning will be who gets more votes of the youth and first time voters.

BJP's first star campaigner for Manipur, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, landed today and held whirlwind meetings before leaving for New Delhi. He predictably talked about the over 100 day-old economic blockade and the permanent peace agreement with NSCN(IM), the militant group that's currently on ceasefire mode.

More than hostilities, the Home Minister focused on creating avenues for the youth. Manipur, with nearly 80 per cent literacy levels, has a higher unemployment rate than the national average.

""We have taken a decision that we will provide loans to at minimum rate for those who are unemployed. I was surprised when I got to know that in the last 15 years there were 600 bandhs in the state. Even after having a stable government for so long why there were so many bandhs?"" Rajnath Singh said while releasing the vision document of the BJP in Imphal.

Manipur has over 19 lakh voters and 40 per cent of them are youth. More than 50 thousand are first time voters. Every political party wants to target the first timers.

And the entry of the Iron Lady Irom Sharmila, who's been fighting against tough military laws in the state, has made these elections a multi-cornered contest.

""I want to support sister Sharmila and her party because they are talking of clean politics, no matter if she wins or loses I will support her cause,"" said RK Bikramjit, Software Developer in Imphal.

In the hills of Manipur, young voters are key. ""Actually we all Nagas support NPF morally but I think the BJP is also strong,"" said Smith, a young voter from Senapati district in Manipur.

His friend Christina said: ""I was to change ... there is lot of corruption, this time around I want to change that.""

The popularity graph for the ruling Congress among young people in Manipur had been going down but in Ibobi Singh the Congress still has a chief ministerial candidate whom the youths are not writing off.

""There have been some issues with Ibobi rule, but there has been several good projects as well and that's why we are once again supporting him to become CM again,"" said Sudhir Singh, a young Congress supporter from Thoubal, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh's constituency where Irom Sharmila is taking on the three time Chief Minister.

If the Congress wants to reach the majority mark of 31 in the 60 member assembly, it surely needs the young voters who are being wooed by both the BJP and Irom Sharmila."

The court was taking note of allegations that appeals were being made by various political parties on the basis of religion.
    
The high court's Lucknow bench of justices Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Sanjay Harkauli gave the order on a PIL filed by local lawyer Ajmal Khan, seeking directions to curb any such inflammatory atmosphere in the ongoing Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

""Let the EC dwell on this matter and through its counsel assist this court as to what appropriate steps can be taken in this regard to curb any inflammatory atmosphere during the current electoral process,"" the court said yesterday in its order.

The petitioner alleged that the depictions and appeals being made by various political parties, their agents and speakers with the consent of their candidates on the basis of religion were causing immense damage and were in violation of provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

It is not in accordance with the philosophy of the Constitution and the mandate of the RP Act as well as the decision of the apex court in an earlier case, it observed.

""The utterances that have been brought on record through this petition and the public depiction thereof, if at all are correct, then it is high time that EC should intervene in the matter in order to curtail any such further depiction either by speakers, agents of political parties or candidates and, moreover, being repeated in a recycled manner depicted in the print and other forms of media including social media,"" the court observed.

"UP Elections 2017: Key To Owaisi's Expansion Plans For UP Is An 86-Year-Old In Sambhal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-in-one-part-of-state-owaisis-ambition-and-chances-rest-on-86-year-old-1659054","Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh: HighlightsAsaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM contests 40 seats in UP
Won no seats in Bihar in 2015
In Sambhal, has appropriated famous 86-year-old Barq Sahib
                                Well past midnight, a large crowd has gathered inside a marriage hall to witness the oratorical prowess of 86-year-old Shafiqur Rehman Barq, who echoes the radicalism of Asaduddin Owaisi, chief of the All India Majlis-e Ittahadul Muslimeen or AIMIM.

For the first time, the party is contesting 40 seats in Uttar Pradesh - in the last state election five years ago, it did not participate. The quantum leap reflects Asaduddin Owaisi's ambition to turn his outfit into a national party with power extending far beyond its traditional reach of Telangana.

Shafiqur Rehman Barq is not the candidate from Sambhal, where Muslims form more than 65 per cent of the population. But for decades, he has been the area's undisputed political overlord, representing it both in parliament and in the state legislature. A four-time Lok Sabha member, he began his career with the Samajwadi Party: ""I was there when Mulayam Singh laid its foundation."" In the 2009 general elections, he left Mulayam Singh, who did not choose him as a candidate, and successfully ran for parliament from Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party. In 2014, he switched back, but lost his bid by just 5,000 votes. ""I was betrayed by my own party,"" he says, alleging that a political rival, Iqbal Mehmood, worked to ensure his defeat.
 UP Elections: Iqbal Mehmood is Samajwadi Party's candidate and the incumbent legislator of Sambhal.Iqbal Mehmood's father fought two elections against Mr Barq, losing one and winning the other. In January, Shafiqur Rehman Barq continued his tradition of political road-crossing to join Mr Owaisi, whose father he knew well. ""Salahuddin Owaisi was with me when I was the convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, so when his son Owaisi called me and said, 'Uncle, work with us, I had to."" Part of the agreement was that the AIMIM's candidate would be his grandson, Zia-ur-Rahman.

On Wednesday, when Uttar Pradesh decides 63 seats, he will run against Iqbal Mehmood, who is Mulayam Singh's candidate and the incumbent legislator.

In 2014, the AIMIM, in its first foray outside Telengana, won two assembly seats in Maharashtra, a windfall for a small party. This success spurred Asaduddin Owaisi's ambition to form a pan-Indian party representing Muslims. But the hype was considerably dampened by the AIMIM's poor showing in Bihar in 2015, where it failed to win a single seat.

It has never contested the UP elections earlier. Its best chance lies in Sambhal and in the support of Shafiqur Rehman Barq.
 Shafiqur Rehman Barq has represented Sambhal both in parliament and state legislatureAt his kothi (bungalow), Iqbal Mehmood, who is in his 60s, is confident that the ""AIMIM is going to be driven out of Sambhal and out of UP. People here, at heart are Samajwadi...Barq only wins when the Samajwadi Party gives him a ticket, but this time, both the people and the party are with me.""

This old rivalry literally partitions Sambhal in two. A shopkeeper near the historic Jama Masjid likened this to the divide between India and Pakistan. Mohallas or neighbourhoods have marked preferences between the two. This makes for a volatile political culture, where election time drives people into frenetic activity, with political processions spilling onto the streets late into the night and groups gathering at home to discuss each day's developments.

""But people are tired of these two men, their rivalry. One is a Nawab (an aristocrat) who is facing anti-incumbency, the other is on a ticket from a party that is Hyderabadi,"" asserts the Muslim candidate from Mayawati's party, Rafatullah, known locally as Neta Chedi. Sambhal has about 40,000 Dalits, predominantly Jatavs, who are Mayawati's main support group; he's hoping that the Dalit-Muslim combine that she has stressed in her campaign will see him through.  Mayawati's rallies in Western UP close to its dates of polling have helped the BSP gain traction.

But in the endless identity arithmetic of Sambhal, Rafatalluah further points to a further subset, and claims that his community of Bovne Turks will vote for him, and not Shafiqur Rehman Barq, who is a Khoje Turk. Turk Muslims, who claim their descent from Mahmood Ghaznavi, are the largest of Sambhal's Muslim community, and are divided into two distinct groups - Khoje and Bovne (the former are the larger group in Sambhal).

This battle between three Muslim candidates, and the possibility of their fractioning the vote among them, has given the BJP the rare hope of winning a Muslim-dominated seat. Its candidate, Arvind Gupta, is a respected and gentle doctor, who is hoping that his personal rapport with the small town will win a portion of the Muslim vote. ""It's true Muslims do not vote for the BJP, but my family and I have a good equation with Muslim families. They are my patients and I am sure they will look beyond the party and vote for me,"" he said.

Sajan Goel, who owns a Mentha factory, Sambhal's only real industry, says that Dr Gupta is the best bet for Sambhal. ""We used to vote the Samajwadi Party into power, but there's been little development since Sambhal became a district. Muslims should unite with us. Forget the party and remember Dr Arvind is a good man,"" he urged.

This is at best a faint hope. Dr Arvind is simply from the wrong party. At a political meeting, this one within the zenana (women's quarters) - purdah is very strictly observed by the Turk Muslims-Shahana tells us ""Dr Arvind is a good man, we like him, but how can we vote for him when his party goes after Muslims? BJP leaders talk of putting us under curfew. We will vote for Barq Sahibas has always spoken in the interest of Muslims,"" she said.

The fact of multiple Muslim candidates vying to emerge as the protector of the community is typical of the Muslim constituencies of this region and Shafiqur Rehman Barq is a past master at this game. People still remember his walkout from the parliament in 2013 to protest the singing of Vande Mataram, a patriotic song described as non-secular by leaders like him and Owaisi said. Even in Chaman Sarai, a locality which is a Samajwadi stronghold, a meat shop owner says, ""Barqsahib is the one to raise Muslim issues in parliament. At a time when gaurakshaks (cow vigilantes) are going after us, he is the best option.""

The AIMIM is riding on voices like these. For Barq, a charged election campaign strengthens his appeal as the combative leader of the Muslims against the perceived threat of the Hindu right.  Owaisi's own radical rhetoric attracted a large crowd at a rally last week in the heart of Sambal.  

But similar large crowds in Bihar did not translate into votes, and the Samajwadi countered with an impressive Akhilesh Yadav rally just three days later."

The two leaders at a press conference released the commitments which include major promises made by the two parties to the people of the state in their manifestos.

The list of commitments include distribution of free smartphones to youth, employment guarantee through skill development to 20 lakh youths, loan waiver to farmers, cheap power and proper remuneration for crops.

It also commits to provide Rs 1,000 monthly pension to one crore poor families and one time food at Rs 10 to urban poor, 33 per cent reservation to women in government jobs and 50 per cent reservation in panchayat and local bodies elections besides power, road and water to every village in five years.

Free cycles to all girl students of class IX to XII and meritorious students, free homes to over 10 lakh poor dalit and backward families, four lane roads connecting all districts and metro in six main cities also figure in the list.

For the minorities and backwards, it promises representation in ratio to their population in all the welfare schemes as also police modernisation for making it more effective and phased expansion of dial-100 scheme.

These commitments include the promises made by Rahul Gandhi during his state-wide Kisan Yatra, such as loan waiver to farmers and reduction of power tariff for them - a long time demand of Congress.

""At least Samajwadi people practically give shape to what they say but some others only do 'mann ki baat' but 'kaam ki baat nahi karte'... they do not say in rallies and in districts what are the achievements of their government,"" Mr Yadav said.

""(They say) two families have entered into an alliance... I will say that two youths have come together it is an alliance of SP and Congress...,"" he stressed in response to a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comment in this regard.

""These are ten steps to development worked out by the two parties on which Congress and SP will work on coming to power in future,"" Mr Yadav added."

Ms Sharmila, 44, who recently launched her political party Peoples' Resurgence And Justice Alliance (PRAJA), is contesting against the 68-year-old Chief Minister.

NDTV caught up with Ms Sharmila during her campaign as she spoke at length on why she is taking a plunge into politics, why she turned down an offer from the BJP and also her take on the economic blockade that has paralysed the state.

NDTV: You have given up your hunger strike and said that now the fight will be taken up politically and you want to take it right inside the legislative assembly. How has the journey into politics been so far?

Irom Sharmila: People's reaction is mixed. They come to realise the real being of me. They come to know about my sense of humanity. Here in Thoubal, I am sitting and discussing with the local community. They are happy about my new step. They all want to see a change and they are fed up of the three terms of the Congress.

NDTV: You want to bring change and a new social order in Manipur. The BJP is also talking of change. What is your opinion on the BJP?

Irom Sharmila: I was approached by the BJP to fight on their ticket in this election. Their suggestion was that to fight Ibobi, I will need 36 crores. If I have it, I should produce it, if not the centre would sanction it. On that condition, I said I will stand for elections as an independent. I don't criticise other political parties. I just want to bring a change in the society. I want to bring the right to justice to all and ensure that the draconian AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) is withdrawn.

NDTV: Before you launched your political party - PRAJA - you had met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and many in Manipur are now saying that you are trying to repeat what Mr Kejriwal did in Delhi. What was his tip for you?

Irom Sharmila: He just wanted me to be successful in bringing real democracy in the society and wanted me to connect with people and he gave brotherly advice.

NDTV: The economic blockade has overshadowed the poll. Does it seems there is any solution?

Irom Sharmila: Right now, the solution is not visible. Our government is benefiting from the blockade politically and until and unless there is a change, things will be the same."

The constituencies are spread across 11 districts -- Saharanpur, Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal, Rampur, Bareilly, Amroha, Pilibhit, Kheri, Shahjahanpur and Badaun.

Of the 67 seats at stake, ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) had won 34 in 2012, followed by BSP 18, BJP 10, Congress 3 and others 2.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah championed the cause of the saffron party during the campaigning, the SP-Congress alliance's charge was spearheaded by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, besides other leaders of the respective parties.

BSP chief Mayawati wooed the voters addressing one rally after another all by herself, with senior party leader SC Misra chipping in at certain places.

Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah slammed the Congress and SP, saying Rahul Gandhi ran a campaign against the SP government and wondered what change of heart made them embrace each other now.

Mr Yadav and Mr Gandhi harped on demonetisation, alleging that PM Modi's notes ban decision had caused immense hardship to those living in the rural areas.

Keeping in mind that western Uttar Pradesh had vast tracts of agricultural land, PM Modi played the pro-poor and pro-farmers card and reiterated BJP's promise of waiving loans of small and marginal farmers and paying the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.

Interestingly, political bigwigs, including SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress president Sonia Gandhi were conspicuous by their absence from the campaign trail in the first two phases of polling."

A total of 839 candidates - including the key parties of BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance as well as the Rashtriya Lok Dal and independents - will contest the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts of western Uttar Pradesh.

With 26 contestants, Agra South will see the maximum number of candidates while Hastinapur will the least number of candidates - six.

According to the Association for Democratic Reforms, approximately 40 per cent of the BJP candidates in phase-1 have declared criminal cases against them, the most, followed by the BSP with a close 39 per cent. The SP-Congress alliance has 28 per cent candidates with criminal cases whereas the RLD has 33 per cent such candidates in the first phase.

Elaborate security arrangements have been made in all districts. Of the 887 polling centres in Muzaffarnagar, 600 have been instilled with video cameras. Around 6,000 paramilitary personnel are also being deployed in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts.

While the SP hopes to retain power - albeit with the Congress this time, the BJP and BSP hope to regain power in the state after 13 and five years, respectively.

The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 Union elections, decimating the Congress, SP and BSP - which were reduced to five, two and zero seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The election in Uttar Pradesh - along with those in Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand - is considered to be a referendum on Mr Modi's demonetisation drive. In his campaigns across Uttar Pradesh, Mr Modi urged voters to root out 'SCAM' - an acronym for Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.

Ms Mayawati is expected to be a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, should the BSP win. Her party was the worst sufferer in the state in the 2014 Union elections as it failed to register a single seat. This time, the party has fielded a record number of candidates belonging to the Muslim community, considered to be a key vote bank for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.

The poll is also a crucial test for the new national president of Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, who gained control of the party after a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister has forged an alliance with the Congress and lately, Rahul Gandhi and Mr Yadav have been jointly campaigning all over Uttar Pradesh. The Congress will contest 24 seats whereas the Samajwadi Party has given tickets to 51 contestants in the first-phase.

Among the 2.6 crore people eligible voters, around 1.4 crore are male, 1.2 crore are female whereas there are a little over 1,500 voters from the third gender.

Attacking Samajwadi Party, the BSP chief assured the voters that she would rid the state of ""prevailing jungle raj"" by putting criminals behind bars and urged Muslims not to waste their votes on SP. ""The first phase of UP polls was encouraging for BSP. It was a clean sweep for our party. It's a positive signal that we are going to form government in the state,"" she told an election rally Sitapur.

On SP-Congress alliance, she said, ""It is political opportunism as Congress joined hands with a government which works on BJP's guidelines.""

""Shivpal Yadav will damage SP because he was insulted by Mulayam Singh due to his affection for son Akhilesh,"" Ms Mayawati said and appealed to minority voters not to support SP.

On BJP, Ms Mayawati claimed demonetisation was a painful decision for 90 per cent farmers, workers and the poor and Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured only the capitalists and the rich.

She charged the Prime Minister with working under RSS directives.

Ms Mayawati recalled the suicide of dalit student Rohit Vemula at Hyderabad Central University and the assault on dalits who allegedly skinned a dead cow in Una in Gujarat, warning that such incidents would happen in Uttar Pradesh if BJP came to power.

She dubbed as ""fake"" the surveys and opinion polls that said BSP will not come to power and said that they will be proved wrong as in 2007, when her party got majority.

""You should not believe in such surveys. If BSP came to power all development schemes will be restarted and names of schemes and places that were changed will be restored,"" she said.

""Employment will be given to young men and women instead of laptops and phones,"" she said, asking minority voters to help BSP get majority in the elections."
"AAP To Now Expand Its Presence In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh And Gujarat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/aap-to-now-expand-its-presence-in-rajasthan-madhya-pradesh-and-gujarat-1658465","Jaipur:                             Aam Aadmi Party is planning to contest the next Assembly elections in Rajasthan and also expand its presence in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat, announced Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia. Incidentally, all these states are presently governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the same breath, the leader expressed confidence that Aam Aadmi Party, led by Arvind Kejriwal, will perform exceedingly well in Punjab and Goa where it is contesting against both the BJP and the Congress.

Mr Sisodia, who is the in-charge of the party affairs in Rajasthan, said, ""In Rajasthan, people are disappointed with BJP rule and they are not willing to trust the Congress. After every Assembly elections, the face changes but governance remains the same. ""In such a scenario, people are looking at AAP with hope.""

""On March 11 when results will be out, we are confident of winning big number of seats in Punjab and in Goa too we are sure of performing well and securing good number of seats,"" Mr Sisodia, who was here to review the party's organisational matters, said at a press interaction.

In reply to a question, Mr Sisodia said that his party will welcome all leaders, including rebels from other political parties, to its fold if they are not corrupt, and have clean characters.

Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he claimed that because of demonetisation, trade, industry and the common man have suffered heavily. ""Those in possession of black money got their money exchanged from back doors, while the aam aadmi, like the farmers and the labourers, had to stand in queues to withdraw their own hard earned money,"" Mr Sisodia said.

Mr Sisodia, claimed the AAP government in Delhi has accelerated development, reduced power tariff and improved the education sector.

"Uttarakhand Election 2017: 68% Overall Voter Turnout In 69 Assembly Constituencies As Voting Ends","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-election-live-voting-begins-in-69-assembly-constituencies-1659585","Dehradun:                             Voting has ended in Uttarakhand's 69 constituencies spread across 13 districts (7 in Garhwal region and the remaining 6 in Kumaon region of the state). Residents of Uttarakhand voted today to decide who will form the next government in the state. The overall voter turnout was 68%, which is 1.2% higher than the 2012 Assembly election (66.8%). The BJP is hoping to unseat the ruling Congress government of Chief Minister Harish Rawat, which is battling corruption charges. Out of a total of 70 constituencies, 69 have voted today and 1 constituency - Karnaprayag will vote on March 9 because of the untimely death of BSP candidate Kuldeep Singh Kanwasi, who met with a fatal accident recently. Karnaprayag is a high profile constituency from where Deputy Speaker of the state assembly Anusuya Prasad Maikhuri is contesting. The security level across the hill state had been heightened, especially along the border with Nepal. Anti-incumbency has always been a factor in Uttarakhand, which has voted out the government in power at the time, in successive elections since its formation. Chief Minister Harish Rawat contested from Haridwar Rural in Garhwal against sitting BJP legislator Swami Yatishwaranand, banking on the Muslim and Dalit voters in the city that is one of the largest pilgrim centres of the country. The BJP has accused the Congress of turning ""Dev Bhoomi"" Uttarakhand, meaning the land of Gods to ""Loot Bhoomi"" - the land of corruption. For Chief Minister Rawat, the battle was seen as uphill and he also contested from Kichcha in Kumaon. The Congress had portrayed this as his attempt to reaffirm the party's commitment to both Kumaon and Garhwal. His detractors saw this as a last-ditch attempt to save the party in seats where up to 12 leaders have defected, leading to instability and a loss of face for the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged people of Uttarakhand to come out and vote in large numbers. A high voter turnout would indicate a change in government. In 2012, Uttarakhand saw a voter turnout of 67.22 per cent. Uttarakhand voted in a single phase. Counting of votes will take place on March 11.

Harish Rawat: I am a small man and I am the Chief Minister of a small state... some of the things he (PM Narendra Modi) has said have been ill-advised and do not give him or his office the respect it deserves.

It has forged an alliance with the Congress for the polls.

According to the Association for Democratic Reforms, approximately 40% of the BJP candidates in phase-1 have declared criminal cases against them, the most, followed by the BSP with a close 39 per cent. The SP-Congress alliance has combined 28 per cent candidates with criminal cases.

Many say the outcome Uttar Pradesh polls will create the roadmap for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

"Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi's Claim Of Secularism Exposed","http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/akhilesh-yadav-rahul-gandhis-claim-of-secularism-exposed-1658995","In a prescient foreword to late politician and writer Rafiq Zakaria's book Communal Rage in Secular India, nobel laureate Amartya Sen had a thought-provoking paragraph analyzing communal riots in India. He wrote ""Everyone has many identities, related not just to one's religion and community, but also to class, occupation, language, gender, political inclinations, and so on. When I was growing up in Bengal in the bloody 1940's, I remember being struck - even as a child - by the fact that the victims of the riots overwhelmingly came from the same class, even when they belonged to different communities or religious groups."" The book in concern was Rafiq Zakaria's much lauded analysis of the Gujarat riots of 2002. A riot which has been much dissected like the 1984 riots, with the victims awaiting justice.

Circa 2017, one of the country's most politically significant states, Uttar Pradesh, is now voting and the undercurrent amidst the development cacophony is clearly religious and caste-based polarization. I am writing this column days after the most polarized districts of Western UP like Muzaffarnagar and Shamli have cast their vote because the purpose of this column was not to influence the voter but to put on display the shameful apathy of our so-called secular leaders.
 The Samajwadi Party and Congress are contesting the UP polls as an allianceTwo days before voting in  Muzaffarnagar, a district which witnessed one of the worst communal riots in the last decade, Amnesty India released a press note which was significant. Among other things which pointed to a lax attitude of the Akhilesh Yadav administration towards the Muzaffarnagar victims, it said, ""The Uttar Pradesh government has failed to expeditiously investigate and prosecute the seven cases of gang-rape filed after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and deliver justice...Over three years after the riots, there has not been a single conviction in any of the cases. Despite changes to India's laws in 2013 requiring trials in rape cases to be completed without unnecessary delay, trials have proceeded extremely slowly. The state government and successive central governments have also failed to adequately protect the survivors from threats and harassment - which in some cases led to them retracting their statements - and to provide adequate reparation.""

Yet, as UP votes, neither the Congress, which is an ally of the Samajwadi Party, nor the Lalu Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal which has been vocal in its support of the Akhilesh government in the last five years, questioned the Chief Minister for his inability to administer justice. It is important to remember that these are the same leaders who demanded justice from Narendra Modi for the 2002 victims in the name of secularism. 

In 2013, when the Muzaffarnagar riots displaced at least 50,000 people and took 62 lives, it was Akhilesh Yadav who was the Chief Minister of the state. Yes, the riots polarized Uttar Pradesh and helped  the BJP with a landslide victory in the general election the next year. But does that give Akhilesh Yadav the right to be indifferent to those seeking justice, especially the women who were raped and are now pleading for justice in courts? Like Modi who was the chief Minister of Gujarat when the riots killed at least thousand and landed families in relief camps, Akhilesh too could do little to stop the killings and rapes in Muzaffarnagar.
 Communal riots tore through the western Uttar Pradesh town of Muzaffarnagar in 2013, leaving more than 60 people dead and thousands homelessAs I travelled through Baghra, Budhana and Jansath tehsils in Muzaffarnagar, where Muslims form roughly 45 percent of the population, I met people who were scared at the prospect of the election. They feared that with BJP leaders including party president Amit Shah bringing  up the Ayodhya issue and the alleged Hindu exodus from Kairana, there could be a return of communal tension in the state. They feared for their women and children, but had nowhere to go.  

More appalling was the fact that the very people who were most affected during the Muzaffarnagar riots, who had lost their property, were willing to give Akhilesh Yadav another chance as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. And they had their reasons. First, they believed that Mayawati had chosen to ignore their plight and shown no interest in getting them justice. Some believed that in the case of a fractured majority, Mayawati could help the BJP return to power, as opposed to Akhilesh Yadav, who had allied with the Congress. Their primary interest in supporting the Chief Minister who sat through their plight was to stop the BJP from assuming power, as it was the BJP which allegedly instigated and benefited from the riots. Akhilesh Yadav, who took on his father by his own confession to clear the Samajwadi Party of thuggery, has shown a weak spine when it comes to justice for the women in his state, whose stories of abuse silence Akhilesh Yadav's tall claims of inclusiveness. That the Muzaffarnagar victims are willing to give him a chance only to keep the BJP at bay should be a source of tremendous embarrassment to Akhilesh Yadav, who is spinning the cycle of secularism"" in Uttar Pradesh and looking to return to power. To quote from the Amnesty report again: ""In three cases, survivors identified and named the men they said had raped them in their First Information Reports, but then retracted their statements in court. Some of them later admitted that they had been compelled to do so after facing pressure and threats to their safety and that of their families, and a lack of adequate support and security from the authorities.""
 BSP chief Mayawati has traditionally done well in Western Uttar Pradesh These documents are part of the public domain, like many others which highlight the plight of the women and displaced children of Muzaffarnagar, and it is highly unlikely that both Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav are not privy to them. So when both leaders who are looking at a possible assembly victory as their big ticket for 2019, look the other way while campaigning in Uttar Pradesh, how different are they from those they slot as the epitome of communalism, like Modi and Shah? 

In a month's time, Uttar Pradesh will have a new government, and irrespective of who assumes power, Akhilesh Yadav will have to carry the baggage of being an inefficient leader to the victims of Muzaffarnagar. And his political rivals could tell him that it is not moral baggage that's easy to live with.

Irom Sharmila, the feisty activist of Manipur, who recently launched her party PRAJA or the Peoples Resurgence and Justice Alliance, dropped her hat in the poll ring to take the fight against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA politically and is contesting against three-time Chief Minister of the Congress.

""The local communities are happy and positive about my new step. They want to see change and they are fed up of the Congress,"" said Ms Sharmila.

Unlike for Mr Singh, Thoubal is not her home, but many have warmed up to her egalitarian ways. Wider public sentiment, however, still remains divided between the leaders.

Supporters of Ms Sharmila look at her as someone capable of ushering in change, while those on Mr Singh's side are confident that he will win.

""Ibobi Singh has won several times. But now with Sharmila, we feel there can be a real change. With her fight against AFSPA in the assembly, the situation might improve,"" said a local voter Kamala Devi.

""We have heard about three candidates but it is Ibobi Singh who is going to win,"" said Thoubal resident Ashok Singh.

After Ms Sharmila ended her 16-year-long fast in protest against alleged army atrocities in Manipur, she had vowed to continue her crusade politically.

Then, she had received both flak and praise for her move to end the fast, but she chose to embark on the journey undeterred. People from her party also believe that her style of campaign is quite ""unlike the regular netas"".

""The down-to-earth leader went around her constituency, met people and heard about their issues,"" said James Mayengbam, one of the top functionaries of PRAJA."

"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: In Noida, Many Find Their Names Missing From Voters List","http://www.ndtv.com/noida-news/in-noida-many-find-their-names-missing-from-voters-list-1658457","Noida:                             There was evident enthusiasm among voters in Noida which went to the polls in the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, but many felt disappointed after finding their names missing from the voters list.

The constituency abutting Delhi recorded a voter turnout of 58.18 percent.

The triangular contest here is between BJP's Pankaj Singh, the son of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Samajwadi Party's Sunil Choudhary and Bahujan Samaj Party's Ravikant Mishra.

Sabhajit Yadav, an auto driver who lives in Sector 8, said he was very disappointed on not finding his name in the voters list.

""My name was missing from the list. An Anganwadi worker came to my house to get the names verified. But when I went to cast my vote, they said my name was not in the Election Commission record,"" Yadav told IANS.

""We have been living here for more than 30 years. How is it possible that my name is not there on the list while my daughter's and my wife's names are there,"" he added.

A polling agent of Samajwadi Party in Sector 11 said there were complaints from a large number of people about their names being missing. An agent of the BJP in the area also seconded him.

Richa Bala, who came to the polling booth at Ghijor village, said that she had voted in the 2014 Lok Sabha election but was unable do so in this election.

Bala's friend, who was accompanying her, said she had called the prescribed toll number to lodge a complaint and got to know that 2,000 such complaints had already been made.

Lalita, who runs a shop at Ghijor village, also rued that she could not vote.

""I have been casting my vote here for the past 25 years. This time my name is missing from the list. My husband's name is there, but not mine,"" she said.

A booth level officer at Ghijor said they could not help those whose names were missing.

""If a person's name is there at multiple places, it gets deleted. People have to take care that they are properly registered at one address only,"" he said.

Contacted, Kumar Vineet, Additional District Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the list was publicised many times.

He said people whose names are missing might not have checked the list.

""There could be many reasons. They should have verified their names in the voters list before the elections,"" Vineet told IANS.

Some voters did not hesitate to express their preferences.

""BJP is in power at the Centre. If they come to power in the state, there will be development here as well. Law and order situation is not good in Uttar Pradesh,"" said Rakesh Bhandari, a resident of Sector 11, who works in a telecom office.

""I think there is a contest between the BSP and BJP,"" he added.

Another voter, Kailash Mandal, a resident of Sector 17, said: ""It is a contest between Samajwadi Party and BJP here in Noida. The BSP is a bit down.""

""There is hope that Sunil Choudhury will win. He is an old candidate from Noida. With BSP contesting this time, BJP will lose votes,"" Mandal added.

"PM Narendra Modi's Speech In Shrinagar In Uttarakhand's Garhwal Region Ahead Of Assembly Elections: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-pm-narendra-modis-speech-in-srinagar-in-uttarakhands-garhwal-region-ahead-of-assembly-elections-1658531","Dehradun:                             Ahead of the Assembly election  in the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally today in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region. Speaking to the people from the GITI ground in Garhwal's Shrinagar town, Prime Minister Modi focused on the BJP's promise of development for the hill state. The Prime Minister also spoke about his government's efforts at the Centre to remove black money and curb corruption - one of the key issues ahead of elections in Uttarakhand. His Garhwal rally comes weeks after he laid the foundation for the 900-Km Char Dham highway project in the state's capital Dehradun. The highway - a 12,000-crore-rupee project - is an all-weather road aimed at improving connectivity between Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. During the launch of the project, the PM had said that the highway will put Uttarakhand's economy, which is dependent on tourism - particularly religious toruism, back on track. It will also help create jobs and people will not have to move out of the state to get employment, he had said. Last week, the Prime Minister had targeted the Congress - which is the incumbent government in Uttarakhand - and criticised its Vice President Rahul Gandhi in Parliament over the situation in the hill state. The PM took a dig at Mr Gandhi, saying, ""the earthquake finally did happen."" The PM was referring to Mr Gandhi's claim, offered in December, that the government was preventing him from speaking in Parliament on the notes ban issue, because if he was allowed to share his remarks, ""an earthquake will happen."" Uttarakhand was hit by a 5.8 magnitude earthquake on February 6, tremors of which, were felt in Delhi too. Mr Gandhi had recently said ""SCAM"", when applied to his party's actions, refers to ""Seva, Courage, Ability and Modesty."" The PM said that the attempt to ""find Seva (service) in Scam"" so distressed ""Mother Earth"" that an earthquake was the result. Uttarakhand will vote in a single phase on February 15, and counting of votes will happen on March 11.

Here are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech at Shrinagar in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region:The current Chief Minister is a person who does not love his state. Can such a person do any good for you all?During the discussion to make Uttarakhand a separate state, they were against it.It is because of them that development has come to a grinding halt in Uttarakhand.Not just in terms of development, they score low on every issue. They have not been able to ensure the safety of women in the state.This election will be a make or break election for the state. Your fate is in your hands. choose wisely.Among all the other Himalayan states, Uttarakhand lags behind despite tremendous potential. Go to Sikkim and see the difference. More than 20 lakh tourists visited the state.But that is not the case in Uttarakhand. Tourists and pilgrims want to visit 'dev bhoomi' (God's land) Uttarakhand, but cannot do so because of poor infrastructure and facilities in the state.Tourism is key for Uttarakhand, and infrastructure must be given a boost. That will boost the economy of the state and create jobs.Roads in Uttarakhand are in a terrible condition. We are doing our bit from the Centre by giving Rs. 12,000 crore for an all-weather road - The Char Dham highway - which will benefit you all immensely. We would like to do much more for you all - even at the state level, but that can only happen if you vote for the BJP. We know our responsibilities, unlike the current government.Uttarakhand has tremendous potential and talent. It even has a rich history. Today, people around the world are seeing the benefits of Yoga. When we talk of Yoga, Haridwar automatically comes to mind.The soil in Uttarakhand is fertile. The state has a rich ecology. Almost every plant that grows here has some medicinal or healing value. Uttarakhand also has a big asset - water. Lots can be done even in this regard. The Panchmeshwar project will help solve many problems in the state.Many soldiers in our armed forces come from Uttarakhand. We are proud of them. But the Congress - they sat on 'One Rank One Pension' for years. For us it was a priority, and you all can see, we did it. We cleared the bill soon after being voted to power.Another top priority for us is to root out black money and corruption. But you all saw the state the country was in till a few years ago. During UPA, black money and corruption were in symphony. There was no intent or effort by them to take any action against the social menace. But then the BJP came, and we brought demonetisation, which shook corruption at its very root. It was a big step towards eradicating black money, which has eaten our system hollow. But they still blame me and abuse me. But don't worry, I can tolerate anything for the benefit of my poor brothers and sisters.Today, you stand at a point where you must choose by way of vote. Vote for a brighter future. Vote for development. Vote for progress.This 'chaiwala' (tea seller) is with you all, and always will be. Together we will win our fight against black money and corruption. My fight will always be for the poor."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Minister Allegedly Threatens To Set Journalist On Fire","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-minister-allegedly-threatens-to-set-journalist-on-fire-1658477","Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh:                             Uttar Pradesh Minister Radhey Shyam Singh allegedly threatened to set a local journalist on fire for not supporting him during the ongoing Assembly elections in the state. Mr Singh of the ruling Samajwadi Party denies the claim.

The journalist has filed a complaint with the police and has handed over the mobile audio of the alleged threat to the Superintendent of Police, Kushinagar, Raju Babu Singh. Mr Singh said he had received the complaint and the matter would be investigated.

In the past too, the minister has been accused of abusing and threatening local government officials over phone.

Earlier, another Uttar Pradesh Minister, Ram Murti Singh Verma, was booked along with five others in connection with the killing of a journalist Jagendra Singh by allegedly setting him on fire in Shahjahanpur district in June 2015. He had made a Facebook post against the minister regarding his alleged involvement in illegal sand mining and land grabbing.

"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: All Major Parties Claim They Swept The First Phase","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-all-major-parties-claim-they-swept-the-first-phase-1658712","Lucknow:                             A day after the first phase of polling, major parties in Uttar Pradesh claimed that they have swept the round and were on the road to form government in the politically crucial state.

Samajwadi Party party chief Akhilesh Yadav said that the downfall of those who had ""befooled"" the people promising ""achche din"" has started while Mayawati asserted that she will prove pollsters wrong as she did in 2007 when they predicted her defeat.

BJP Chief Amit Shah claimed 'achhe din' will come in Uttar Pradesh after counting of votes on March 11.

Claiming that SP was ahead of rivals in the first phase, Akhilesh said the trend will continue and the alliance will get majority.

""We could have got majority alone, but after alliance with Congress we will comfortably win over 300 seats,"" Akhilesh said in Badaun.

""The downfall of those who had befooled people promising 'achche din' has started. After 2017, they will be wiped out in 2019 also. They (BJP) should tell as to what have they done for people,"" he said.

Addressing a rally in Sitapur, Mayawati claimed it was a ""clean sweep"" for BSP in the first phase.

""The first phase of UP polls was encouraging for BSP. It was a clean sweep for our party. It's a positive signal that we are going to form government in the state,"" she told an election rally here.

She dubbed as ""fake"" the surveys and opinion polls that said BSP will not come to power and said that they will be proved wrong as in 2007, when her party got majority.

""You should not believe in such surveys. If BSP came to power all development schemes will be restarted and names of schemes and places that were changed will be restored,"" she said.

Mr Shah said BSP is the main rival from BJP in first two phases of Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls and Samajwadi Party in the rest five.

""As per the trend of first phase, we will get more than 50 seats (out of 73). In the first two phases we will be getting more than 90 seats (out of total 140). The main rival in these two phases is BSP. In the next phases, the rival will be SP,"" Mr Shah told reporters in Lucknow.

He claimed that issues like payment of cane dues, loans at zero per cent interest to farmers, anti-Romeo squads to check crime against women, and some other key points in BJP manifesto had attracted youths and common people and they were supporting BJP.

Slamming Akhilesh, Mr Shah said he has conceded defeat by sacrificing 105 (of the 403) seats to Congress.

On the chief minister's charge that 'acche din' have eluded the people, he said, ""By saying this, Akhilesh has accepted that he has failed. After ruling for five years, he is asking when will 'acche din' come. It will come after March 11, when BJP will form government.""

The first phase of UP polls in 73 assembly constituencies witnessed 64.22 per cent voter turnout yesterday. Voting will be held in 67 Assembly constituencies spread over 11 districts on February 15.

The other five phases will be held on February 19, 23 and 27 and on March 4 and 8.

Counting will be taken up on March 11."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017 Live: Polling Closes For The State's Polls' First Phase","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-elections-live-first-phase-of-voting-begins-in-uttar-pradesh-today-1658261","The first phase of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections took place today in the key constituencies of Mathura, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Noida, among others. The first-phase election in India's largest state is an intense, high-octane three way contest between the BJP, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance. While the SP hopes to retain power - albeit with the Congress this time, the BJP and BSP hope to regain power in the state after 13 and five years, respectively.

The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 Union elections, decimating the Congress, SP and BSP - which were reduced to five, two and zero seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The election in Uttar Pradesh - along with those in Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand - is considered to be a referendum on PM Modi's demonetisation drive. In his campaigns across Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi urged voters to root out 'SCAM' - an acronym for Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.

Ms Mayawati is expected to be a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, should the BSP win. Her party was the worst sufferer in the state in the 2014 Union elections as it failed to register a single seat. This time, the party has fielded a record number of candidates belonging to the Muslim community, considered to be a key vote bank for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.

The poll is also a crucial test for the new national president of Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, who gained control of the party after a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister has forged an alliance with the Congress and lately, Rahul Gandhi and Mr Yadav have been jointly campaigning all over Uttar Pradesh. The Congress will contest 24 seats whereas the Samajwadi Party has given tickets to 51 contestants in the first-phase.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an incumbent Lok Sabha member from Varanasi whereas Congress' top leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are parliamentarians from Raebareli and Amethi, respectively.

He is also slated to speak at a rally for daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav
First rally after his son Akhilesh Yadav took over the reins of the party
                                When Samajwadi Party mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav gets up to speak at a rally in Takha, his brother Shivpal Yadav's assembly constituency Jaswantnagar this afternoon, it will be the first, and probably one of the two election rallies he will address over the next few days. The other rally, is slated for his younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, in the Lucknow cantonment seat in Uttar Pradesh's Capital.

This will also be Mulayam's first election rally after a number of flip-flops on whether he would campaign for the Samajwadi Party after his son Akhilesh Yadav took over the reins of the party. Today's rally coincides with the first phase of polling in the state that will vote in seven phases ending March 8.  Jaswantnagar will go to polls in the third phase, on February 19.

""I am not sure he is addressing any other rallies apart from Jaswantnagar. He had some plans for Mainpuri but they have been cancelled,"" said a leader close to the senior Yadav, who said he doesn't want to be identified. The Mainpuri assembly seat is one of the five segments that make up for the parliamentary constituency, also called Mainpuri, that has voted for Mulayam Singh Yadav or his nominee since 1996.

Over the last six months, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has gained complete control over the party that his father founded in the nineties and is the party's national president. As he went ahead to stitch an alliance with the Congress, Mulayam made his displeasure known again when he suggested that he would not campaign for the SP-Congress alliance.

Shivpal, till recently the party's key strategist before he was sidelined in the bitter power struggle that saw the transfer of the power within the party from Mulayam to son, Akhilesh - is fighting from his traditional seat, Jaswantnagar that he won by 1.3 lakh votes in 2012 - but he is not even a star campaigner for the party.

For many SP candidates, neither is Mulayam.

An Akhilesh aide said there hadn't been too many requests from candidates who want Mulayam to campaign for them. ""It's because of two reasons - one they don't want to rub Akhilesh the wrong way. Two, they believe that Akhilesh has the popular vote even within the party,"" the aide said.

Sangeet Som made news with his fiery speeches during Muzaffarnagar riots
Polling is on for first of 7 phases of assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh
                                BJP lawmaker Sangeet Som's brother, Gagan Som, was detained this morning in Uttar Pardesh's Faridpur for carrying pistol inside a polling booth, a police officer said. 

Gagan Som was whisked away from inside the booth after a pistol was recovered from his possession. An official told IANS that the act was in contravention of election rules and hence the action was taken.

The polling is underway for the for the first of the seven phases of the high-stake Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections with voters queueing up to cast their ballots in 73 constituencies spread over 15 districts of western UP.
 Gagan Som whisked away from a polling booth in Faridpur in Uttar PradeshSangeet Som, the BJP's controversial lawmaker in Uttar Pradesh, was accused of violating the poll code after the police last month found CDs in a car he was using to campaign for next month's election.

"UP Elections 2017: Battleground Saharanpur Is Big Test For Congress, BSP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-battleground-saharanpur-is-big-test-for-congress-bsp-1659530","SAHARANPUR:                             As Saharanpur goes to polls on Wednesday, the stakes are the highest for the Congress - its campaign spearheaded by its firebrand UP vice-president Imran Masood. The party is contesting five of the seven assembly seats in the region, where Mayawati's attempts to forge a Muslim-Dalit combination will also be put to test.

More than 40% of the people in this fertile agricultural belt, home to one of the most influential Islamic seminaries, the Darul Uloom Deoband, are Muslims. The Dalit population is around 22%. Large pockets of the Gujjar community are also there, especially in seats like Gangoh and Nakur. The latter is the seat from where Imran Masood, one of Congress' four state vice presidents, is contesting.

Mr Masood hit the headlines in 2014, when he was arrested for a hate speech against Narendra Modi, an image he wants to put behind. ""Look, to say botti botti (chopping into pieces) is... the sort of language we use colloquially... I have already said I was wrong. My politics is not of hate, and people know that,"" Masood tells NDTV.
Not everyone is as convinced.

Muzzafarnagar is next door, points out BJP supporter Dr Gupta, and after the riots and the tenor of the speeches of the BJP leaders, Muslims were looking for more dabang (fearless) Muslim leaders. But he too concedes that ""Imran has charisma and is always ready to listen to people's problems.""

Mr Masood moved out of the Samajwadi Party in 2013 to join the Congress. Now seen as a favourite of party vice president Rahul Gandhi, he is reported to have influenced the choice of candidates in all seven seats. From one seat, Gangoh, he even fielded his brother Noman.

Mr Masood is ebullient about how the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance would sweep the elections under Rahul Gandhi, whom he calls the country's ""most dynamic leader"" and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, ""the face of development"".

It is this image of power, real and sometimes exaggerated, that makes Mr Masood the chief target for his rivals. His challenges come from many quarters.

Closer home, it is his uncle Rashid Masood, who has been upset that his nephew, and not his son Shadan, was being promoted within the Congress.

Mr Masood also has to assuage angry Gujjars, who accuse him of sabotaging tickets to Gujjar candidates such as Mukesh Chowdhury. ""Please don't be angry with me,"" he tells an audience of 150 Gujjars at Mohdipur village, attempting to placate clan elders.

A short distance away, outside their huts in the poorest part of the village, a few Dalit women listen to him. But they have already made up their minds. ""We only vote for the elephant,"" they say.

The sentiment is echoed other parts of Saharanpur.

Behat sent BSP candidates to the Lok Sabha and state assembly in the last elections. ""If Mayawati gives an elephant a ticket from Behat, we will vote for it,"" says Gagan, an elderly shopkeeper from Alampur village.

The BSP has fielded Mohammad Iqbal, better known as Haji Iqbal, from Behat. For someone who had run into trouble with the Enforcement Directorate, it is no surprise that his wealth and the sprawling Glocal campus, an educational institute he set up, is a talking point. In his election affidavit, he had declared assets to the tune of 14 crore rupees.

""Haji Iqbal is the BSP's big leader and he's the one giving Masood sleepless nights,"" says Obaid, an engineer. But he is countered by colleague Sadat, who bets on Imran's popularity. The Congress nominee from the seat is Naresh Saini, but the contest in Behat has become a proxy battle between Haji Iqbal and Mr Masood.

There is another smaller, but embarrassing challenge for Mr Masood from within his own party. Saad Ali Khan, a man denied the Congress ticket is now fighting as an independent from the rural Saharanpur seat. Mr Khan, who hails from an elite family, insists he was a sure-shot winner and blames an insecure Masood of blocking his ticket."

She will campaign for five days in the two family boroughs, represented by her brother, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, and her mother Sonia Gandhi, a party leader said on Friday.

As of now, Priyanka Gandhi will only campaign for the 10 party candidates in the two parliamentary constituencies, the Congressman said on conditions of anonymity.

At a later stage, she might canvass for the joint candidates of the Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance, he added.    

""She has always been campaigning in Amethi and Rae Bareli. For the first time her name is on the star campaigners' list. If a person's name is not on the star campaigners' list, the expenses for availing helicopter services will be borne by the candidate of that particular constituency,"" said a party leader.

""If his/her name is there on the star campaigners' list, the expenses for availing the chopper will be borne by the party. The extent of campaigning and the constituencies covered depend on the candidate and not on the party. Now, it depends on her and she might campaign in a few constituencies outside Amethi and Rae Bareli. It is for her to decide,"" he added.

The Congress and Samajwadi Party, despite the alliance, had a face-off in three constituencies - Amethi, Unchahaar and Gauriganj.

Meanwhile, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has also finalised her programme and will make a rare appearance in Rae Bareli on February 20.

She has, so far, not being able to hit the campaign trail because of her ill-health.
Rahul Gandhi will address one rally in Rae Bareli on February 18 and another in Amethi, his own parliamentary constituency, on February 24.

Amethi will go to the polls on February 27 while Rae Bareli will vote on February 23."
"UP Election 2017: Ajit Singh's Party Tries to Stitch Together Rainbow Coalition","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-2017-ajit-singhs-party-tries-to-stitch-together-rainbow-coalition-1659146","The Rashtriya Lok Dal has ruled out any post-poll alliance with the BJP, enthused by reports that their traditional votebank in western Uttar Pradesh, the Jats, are angry with the BJP and may return to fold. The Jat support had swung to the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections following the Muzzaffarnagar riots, and the RLD - which had won 9 seats in 2012 assembly elections -- had drawn a blank. But with the perceived failure of the BJP to deliver on its pre-election promise of reservation in government jobs, there are reports that the Jat ire against the party has grown.

""I am focussed on polls and not looking at post-poll,"" Jayant Chaudhary, the son of party chief Ajit Singh, told NDTV. ""I can assure you that under no circumstances we are looking at the BJP as an alternative.""

As the longtime representative of Jat concerns, the RLD contends that the BJP has not kept the promises made to the Jats in 2014. There is no reservation in government jobs, better support price to sugarcane farmers was not offered and dues to sugar cane farmers remain yet to be paid. This time, the BJP has promised that if voted to power, cane dues for farmers will be paid within a fortnight.

At election rallies like the one in Kundarki constituency, a Muslim-majority constituency on the outskirts of Moradabad, Mr Chaudhary talks of building bridges between communities and thereby, a new political coalition.

""One party says the Muslims are getting together, so Hindus must all get together. Another party talks about caste. I am saying all weavers, farmers, labourers should all unite,"" he declared at the rally, taking a dig at both the BJP and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party.

But 90 km away in Bijnore, there is palpable tension after a 17-year-old Jat boy in Nayagaon was killed and his father seriously injured. All the accused in the violence -- which took place three days ago -- are Muslims, which created tension and underscored the trust deficit between the two communities.

The RLD candidate from the area had to face a hostile crowed when he visited the victim's family. ""Why can't it be treated like any other crime? Why bring it a communal angle? Such things should be banned. Do BJP leaders visit the victims of 5,000 murders and 2,000 rapes?"" Mr Chaudhury questioned.

A group of Muslim cushion makers at Kundarki, located next to Mr Chaudhary's rally in Moradabad, downplay his attempts at a rainbow coalition. ""We think it is a party of the Jats and we won't be able to vote for them,"" says Tahir, one of the workers busy stitching the cover of a cushion.

The sentiment is reciprocated 5 kilometres away in Jatupura -- a village dominated by Jatavs but which has hundreds of Jat families."

"Manipur Elections 2017: 100-Day Blockade The Biggest Poll Issue","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-100-day-blockade-the-biggest-poll-issue-1656650","Guwahati:                             The Manipur blockade by Naga groups, which will enter its 100th day tomorrow, is turning out to be the biggest issue in the assembly elections which will be held in less than a week's time. As people try to cope with the shortage of essential items, the Centre today called in two Naga leaders, who are in a jail in Manipur for allegedly masterminding the blockade, for talks.

The blockade had started on November 1 last year after Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh carved out seven new districts in the state. It has made life miserable for voters, with cooking gas shooting up to Rs. 2000 a cylinder in the black market.

On Friday, the Centre took the court's permission and flew Gaidon Kamei and Stephan Shankril to Delhi.  The two are the top leaders of the United Naga Council, or UNC, which insists that it must be part of any talks to lift the blockade.

The talks, though, remained inconclusive and another round of talks will be held on February 7.

Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said, ""The tripartite have been held and we have told our officials that the mandate is clear. Any which way we need to find a solution to this crisis"".

The blockade is the BJP's main poll plank and it wants the matter solved before the state goes to polls. The party, which won the assembly elections in Assam last year, thinks it has a chance of winning Manipur. Over the last six months, a dozen leaders of the Congress, which rules the state, have defected to the BJP.

""This is a blockade of Ibobi Singh, by Ibobi Singh and for Ibobi Singh. He has allowed this to happen for political benefits but we will not allow him to succeed,"" said Union minister Prakash Javedaker, who is in charge of the party's campaign in Manipur.

The Congress is targeting the non-Naga voters who decide 40 of 60 assembly seats by hinting at a nexus between the former Naga militant group NSCN (IM) and the UNC.

""The BJP might disagree, but it is a fact that after the creation of seven new districts, there was firing on police personal. Now if UNC is not linked to NSCN (IM), then UNC must be an armed group. Then the Centre should ban it,"" said N Bijoy Singh, the Congress spokesperson in Manipur"

According to sources, Sonia Gandhi who has been indisposed for some time and has not been active in handling party work for a few months now, is all set to campaign in Uttar Pradesh but will restrict herself to Rae Bareli.

Ending speculation on whether she will campaign in Uttar Pradesh after Congress forged a pre-poll alliance with Samajwadi Party in the state, Sonia reportedly confirmed that she will campaign in her Rae Bareli constituency.

Sources added that while both Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will campaign in Rae Bareli and Amethi, their schedule has not yet been finalised.

Sonia Gandhi did not campaign in Punjab and Goa and is yet to canvas in Uttarakhand.

Amethi and Rae Bareli go to polls in the 4th and 5th phase of polling in the state on February 23 and 27.

There are 10 assembly seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli in the Gandhi family's pocket-borough and have become a bone of contention between the two partners.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Yadav also dismissed reports of intra-party differences after his brother Shivpal Yadav, who has been sidelined in the party, talked about floating a new outfit post the Assembly polls.

""There is no bickering...Akhilesh will be the next Chief Minister...I will campaign (for the alliance) from tomorrow,"" Mr Yadav told reporters on Parliament premises when asked about his opposition to the alliance and his reluctance to campaign for it.

Mr Yadav also played down reports of Mr Shivpal, who was locked in a bitter battle with Akhilesh over control of SP, planning to form new party post assembly polls in the state.

""No one is unhappy...he (Shivpal) has not spoken to me or anyone in the party. He may have said out of anger...now leave it, there will be no new party,"" he asked.

The SP patriarch had on January 29 voiced displeasure over the alliance, and said he would not campaign for it. The Samajwadi Party and Congress have forged a pre-poll alliance in Uttar Pradesh contesting 298 and 105 seats respectively.

Last week, Shivpal Yadav, unhappy over his supporters being denied party ticket for the high-voltage election, had stated he will form a new party after March 11, when the poll results will be out.

Ms Sharmila will contest from Thoubal seat, convenor of her party People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) Erendro Leichonbam, said.

Known for her fight against Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Ms Sharmila is a political greenhorn while Congress has been in power in Manipur for three successive terms under Ibobi Singh.

Congress on February 3 had released a list of 60 candidates for Manipur Assembly elections, with Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh contesting Thoubal seat.

In August last year, the 44-year-old Iron Lady broke her 16-year-old hunger strike, the world's longest such campaign, and declared that she wants to become the chief minister so that she could press for repeal of the contentious AFSPA.

While launching her party PRJA in October last year, Ms Sharmila had said she would contest from two seats - Thoubal and Khurai. While she belongs to Khurai, Thoubal is the Assembly constituency of the Chief Minister.

Leichonbam said the party has already started campaigning in Thoubal for Ms Sharmila.

However, there is no word yet about her contesting Khurai seat.

Ms Leichonbam said PRJA, which recently was allotted 'whistle' as the party's symbol, is likely to field altogether 10 candidates for the Assembly elections to be held on March 4 and 8.

Meanwhile, the Naga People's Front (NPF), the ruling party in Nagaland, has announced names of 15 candidates for the Manipur Assembly elections."

The five-hour rally featuring Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and partner Rahul Gandhi of the Congress had been designed to draw attention to the young leaders as another part of the state voted. A strategy that was first tested by PM Modi in the national election of 2014.

The plan was to divert attention with the hype around a big joint rally in the PM's constituency in eastern UP, while western UP, where the BJP is seen as strong, voted.

The Congress has said that tomorrow's road show was cancelled because the administration withdrew permission earlier granted, citing celebrations in the area of the birth anniversary of a saint Guru Ravidas. The road show would be held another day, the party said.

Varanasi's District Magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra however told NDTV that officials had been informed of ""no such programme for February 11,"" and sources said a clash of dates scuttled the road show. The Congress, before fixing the date had apparently failed to check with Akhilesh Yadav, who had already committed the date to campaigning in other parts of the states.

Mr Yadav, 43, and Mr Gandhi, 46, have held joint road shows in Lucknow, Kanpur and Agra, traveling together in a souped-up Mercedes SUV and drawing big crowds. 

Varanasi has eight assembly seats, three are held by the BJP, two each won by SP and BSP and one by Congress. But since BSP MLA Uday Lal Maurya switched over to BJP, the party has four seats. Polling will be held here on March 8, the last phase of the UP elections. There have been reports of some skirmishes between local Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders over seat sharing in the area. In their alliance, the Congress as junior partner is contesting 105 of UP's 403 seats, while the Samajwadi Party is contesting the rest.

Strategist Prashant Kishor, who had designed PM Modi's winning campaign in the 2014 national election, has been drafted by the Congress for this year's UP elections and is believed to have planned the joint road show that has been postponed. PM Modi had held a mega rally driving down the winding roads of Varanasi before those elections. Rival parties had complained about the media attention he received while voting was on in other parts of the state.

The BJP swept UP in 2014, winning 71 of the state's 80 seats.

In August Last year, Congress President Sonia Gandhi's roadshow in Varanasi had to be called off mid-way as she took ill."

Mr Kejriwal, called the electioneering in both states an ""incredible experience"" for his party. The leader remained confident of achieving victory in the assembly elections of both Punjab and Goa. Punjab saw a voter turnout of 70 per cent till 5 pm and Goa saw record 83 per cent voters turn up, said Election commission officials.

After hectic campaigning in the states Mr Kejriwal, along with Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia returned to the national capital. A known movie buff, he watched Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Raees' along with Mr Sisodia.

""These elections were fought by the people for the people. They spent money, campaigned door to door,"" he said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

Expressing confidence that AAP will win the elections, Mr Kejriwal said, ""It was an election of hopes. People have high hopes, and we will together fulfil those hopes."" The leader reserved special thanks for the NRI supporters, who helped the party in the polls, terming them as ""amazing people"".

In the same breath, Mr Kejriwal alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government harassed the donors of Aam Aadmi Party.

The Aam Aadmi Party has debuted in these states, in a bid to expand their presence beyond Delhi where they had a landslide victory in 2015. The party has not named a Chief Ministerial candidate, though its lawmaker Bhagwant Mann, AAP's tallest leader in the state, is reportedly top seeded.

Results will be announced in Punjab and Goa on March 11 along with Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur that go to polls this week."

But 25-year-old Vandana Sharma knew this the day she quietly stepped out of her house with Rs 10,000 on a chilly January morning to file her nomination papers as an independent candidate from the Fatehpur Sikri assembly constituency.

The money, a third of her Rs 32,000 that she had declared as her assets in the election affidavit, was for the security deposit.

Ms Sharma says the struggle to get her family's support was a challenge.

""My parents wanted to marry me off, this is my last resort. I need to make something of myself,"" said Ms Sharma.

Ms Sharma is pursuing her graduation in Arts from Agra college. Her battles, however, aren't only about her life.

""My village has no basic amenities. There are no colleges nearby. Girls have to be accompanied by a male member if they step out. And we can't step out after 6pm... In 21st century India, this has to change,"" says Ms Sharma, a farmer's daughter.

During campaigning in the village, Ms Sharma promised to improve the lives of women through quality education, better healthcare and a safer environment.

""I will definitely vote for her, we have spent our lives inside the house, our daughters must step out,"" said Sarla Devi.

But it is mostly a lonely battle for her. Her youngest brother who has just completed his post-graduation, Sushil Sharma, is the only one by her side.

"Punjab Elections 2017: Re-Polling Ordered In 48 Polling Stations","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-elections-2017-re-polling-ordered-in-48-polling-stations-1657060","Chandigarh:                             The Election Commission on Tuesday ordered re-polling at 48 polling stations of Amritsar Lok Sabha constituency and the five assembly segments, including a seat from which SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia is contesting, following malfunctioning in VVPATs and EVMs during February 4 elections.

The re-poll will be held on February 9. It was ordered in the wake of the malfunctioning of Voter-Verified Audit Paper Trail (VVPAT) and Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in these stations during the polling.

The re-polling has been ordered at 12 polling stations of Majitha Assembly seat, nine each of Muktsar and Sangrur, one each of Moga and Sardulgarh and 16 polling stations of Amritsar Parliamentary constituency, official said.

""The re-polling will take place at 48 polling stations because of the malfunctioning that occurred in some VVPATs and EVMs on the polling day. The re-polling will take place on February 9,"" Punjab Chief Electoral Officer VK Singh said.

Mr Singh said the polling hours shall be from 8 am to 5 pm and all the voters queued up till 5 pm at the polling stations can cast their votes.

Punjab CEO said necessary arrangements have been made and election material, EVMs, security and poll staff in adequate numbers have been deputed for this task.

""The central paramilitary force will be deployed at each polling station and no outsider will be allowed to stay,"" he said.

Despite facing problems in VVPAT, the Election Commission said they will be used during the re-poll.

""VVPATs will be used during the re-poll. A total of 47 VVPATs will be deployed at the polling stations and sufficient numbers of machines have been kept as reserve,"" he said.

Problem in VVPAT was witnessed in Majithia, Muktsar and Sangrur assembly segments while EVMs were found faulty in Moga and Sardulgarh segments.

No VVPAT was used in Sardulgarh segment, said CEO. EC had used VVPAT for the first time in Punjab at 6,668 polling stations in 33 Assembly segments and two segments in Amritsar Lok Sabha seat.

During the mock polls, 538 VVPATs were replaced while during polling 187 VVPATs were replaced.

Polling was affected at 25 polling stations in Majitha and ten each in Sangrur and Muktsar because of VVPAT malfunctioning.

VVPAT generates a receipt and allows people to verify the vote went in favour of the candidate against whose name the button was pressed on the electronic voting machine.

In one polling station each of Moga and Sardulgarh segments, EVMs had displayed the votes cast during mock polls despite the polling beginning at 8 am.

CEO said the officials at polling station in Moga and Sardulgrah where problems in EVM surfaced, maintained that they had pressed the 'clear' button to clear the votes polled during mock polls."

Replying to the panel's earlier notice, Mr Parrikar said his words were ""wrongly translated"" and also questioned the authenticity of the compact disc containing his alleged speech and the veracity of the transcripts.

Issuing the fresh notice, the Election Commission said the CD and the transcripts were ""authentic"".

 ""Your reply (February 3) has been forwarded to the Chief Electoral Officer of Goa for comments on the contentions made regarding the authenticity of the CD and the veracity of the transcripts.

""The issues of authenticity and veracity have been assessed and it has been confirmed that they have not been tampered with in any manner whatsoever,"" the Election Commission said in its latest notice, which also contains the relevant portion of his January 29 speech in north Goa.

""... now somebody will give you 2,000 rupees, 1,000 rupees, 3,000 rupees. Calculate it. We give Rs 1,500 per month. In five years, Rs 1,500 becomes Rs 90,000 and this will further increase. Therefore, you will get nearly a lakh or 1,25,000 rupees for the next five years,"" Mr Parrikar said.

"'You Will Have To Study Modi,' Says Prime Minister To Critics Of Notes Ban","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/perfect-timing-says-pm-narendra-modi-in-strong-defence-of-notes-ban-1656839","New Delhi:                             The economy was strong and the timing of the notes ban was perfect, PM Modi said in parliament today, in a detailed defence of his decision to abolish 500 and 1,000-rupee notes in November last year, aimed at eliminating corruption and black money. Congress governments before his would have done it, PM Modi said, if there was any electoral benefit to be derived. The PM's address comes in the middle of crucial assembly elections in five states and just ahead of voting for the first of seven phases in Uttar Pradesh.

Replying to a motion of thanks to the President's address at the start of the Budget session, the Prime Minister hit back at opposition leaders who criticised the notes ban in their speeches during the debate. ""You would have done this first, but this is not about keeping the seat of power, it entails a lot of hard work, so was not a priority for you. No worries. We do not shy away from work,"" PM Modi said.

He countered critics who have accused him of taking a hasty decision by saying, ""Nothing was done in haste. To understand that you will need to study Modi."" The ban, he said, was timed to coincide with the slump that follows a peak in trade during the Diwali festival. ""We calculated that this would be the least disruptive time and the maximum impact would be over within 50 days. Our calculation was accurate,"" the Prime Minister said.    

He was often asked, he said, why he had made the sudden decision to scrap high value notes when ""things were going fine."" It was a preventive step at a time when the economy was resilient, the PM said, asserting, ""for demonetisation, this was the most opportune time. India could handle it best at this time.""

The Congress' Mallikarjun Kharge had on Monday demanded that PM Modi apologise for the notes ban, which he said had caused people untold misery. Mr Kharge was supported by leaders of other opposition parties.

PM Modi said the notes ban has ""cleansed India, ended the shadow economy,"" underscoring that ""the strength of a policy is dependent on intent. If the intent is harmful, the policy goes into minus, not just zero.""

The steps he said were not sudden, reminding the house that the Supreme Court had asked why successive governments had done nothing to curb black money. ""We took it very seriously"" and worked towards it, he said.  

Rival parties have taken demonetisation to the election battleground, accusing the government of punishing the poor rather than the corrupt with the cash crunch that followed the notes ban announcement on November 8 last year, which took out 86 per cent of the cash in circulation. The currency shortage hit the rural poor and the middle class, farmers and small traders hardest and the government has admitted that it has also caused a slowdown of the economy, promising that will not spill over into the next year.  

The elections in five states all through February and into March are the first big electoral test that the ruling BJP faces after the notes ban. It has credited gains in by-elections and civic polls to PM Modi's firm steps against corruption, saying these are a signal of the people's support for the move."
"Manipur Elections 2017: Notification Issued For Polls In 38 Assembly Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-notification-issued-for-polls-in-38-assembly-seats-1657064","Imphal:                             Election notification was on Monday issued for 38 assembly constituencies in Manipur which would go to polls on March 4 in the first phase.

According to an official release, returning officers of 38 assembly constituencies issued the election notification, starting the poll process.

The assembly constituencies where polling would be held during the first phase are - Khundrakpam, Heingang, Khurai, Kshetrigao, Thongju, Keirao, Andro, Lamlai, Thangmeiband, Uripok, Sagolband, Keishamthong, Singjamei, Yaiskul, Wangkhei, Sekmai, Lamsang, Konthoujam, Patsoi, Langthabal, Naoriya Pakhanglakpa, Wangoi, Mayang Imphal, Nambol, Oinam, Bishnupur, Moirang, Thanga, Kumbi, Saikul, Kangpokpi, Saitu, Tipaimukh, Thanlon, Henglep, Churachandpur, Saikot and Singhat, the release said.

The last date for filing nomination papers is February 14.

Scrutiny of nomination papers will be held on February 16 while the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers is February 18.

Meanwhile, the Manipur blockade by Naga groups, which will enter its 100th day today, is turning out to be the biggest issue in the assembly elections which will be held in less than a week's time. As people try to cope with the shortage of essential items, the centre on Tuesday called in two Naga leaders, who are in a jail in Manipur for allegedly masterminding the blockade, for talks.

The blockade is the BJP's main poll plank and it wants the matter solved before the state goes to polls. The party, which won the assembly elections in Assam last year, thinks it has a chance of winning Manipur. While the Congress is targeting the non-Naga voters who decide 40 of 60 assembly seats by hinting at a nexus between the former Naga militant group NSCN (IM) and the UNC.

Addressing an election rally in Aligarh, PM Modi said that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was desperately trying to seek the help of anything to retain power.

PM Modi said that Samajwadi Party government has done ""nothing"" for development in the state. ""When the wind is so strong, even a young leader cannot face it and seeks help of anything ...even a pole...but this time BJP 'aandhi' (storm) is so strong that the Chief Minister fears that he might be blown off... The people of UP want change and justice,"" the PM said.

He used his signature style of coining acronyms to assert that BJP will bring ""Vikas"" - 'Vidyut' (electricity), 'Kanoon' (law and order) and 'Sadak' (roads), if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh.

 The Prime Minister said that his government's efforts to weed out black money from the country has created fear among opposition parties. ""We are working to save money by adopting strict measures. Will they not be angry with me and will not come together to defeat Modi? ...They feel that if they remain alone, Modi will get majority in the Rajya Sabha and make such rules that thieves, looters and the corrupt will not get any help. This is their fear,"" he said.

The Prime Minister said that Rs 40,000 crores from the treasury has been saved by linking aadhar cards and bank accounts to the central government's pension schemes which was being misused by the corrupt.

PM Modi also attacked the Akhilesh Yadav government for ""doing nothing for development"" and accused it of neither checking corruption, casteism and nepotism, nor clearing the cane farmers' dues. ""Youths were asked to pay bribe and bring recommendation for interviews by MLAs and Ministers. Poor had to mortgage land and assets to pay. This has to be stopped,"" he said.

Claiming that ""the corrupt are flourishing under the current UP administration"", PM Modi said that his government has linked pension to Aadhaar and bank accounts to check corruption.

Among the seizures, the value of gold and silver turned out to be the highest at Rs. 26.14 crore, followed by drugs to the tune of Rs. 17.89 crore, liquor at Rs. 13.36 crore and cash of Rs. 9.52 crore, an official in the state elections office said here today.

The seizure was made by surveillance teams comprising of Punjab police, Narcotic Control Bureau, state excise and income tax department starting from January 4 when the model code of conduct came into force till February 4 when the polling took place, the official said.

Punjab police intercepted cash amounting to Rs. 58 crore during special checking undertaken throughout the state and then handed over Rs. 25.33 crore to the Income Tax department for further investigation.

Police, however, after seizing Rs. 1.14 crore, released about Rs. 32 crore which belonged to some banks. Out of Rs. 25.33 crore, the income tax sleuths seized Rs. 8.38 crore and released Rs. 9.97 crore after verification. A sum of Rs. 7.35 crore was still under investigation, the official said.

With drugs remaining a major poll issue in the state, the surveillance teams including NCB seized drugs worth 17.89 crore from different parts of the state, official said.

Seized drugs included poppy husk, opium, heroin, cocaine, charas, drug powder and even medicines like Tramadol, Alprazolam, Chlotdiazepoxide, Mifepristone which are abused. The surveillance teams also seized 12.43 lakh litres of illicit and legally produced liquor worth Rs. 13.36 crore at several places in the state, the official said.

In one case, the teams had made the biggest seizure of alcohol with the recovery of over one lakh liquor bottles in Bathinda district of Punjab in the wake of assembly polls. Punjab police seized gold and silver worth Rs. 26.14 crore and prominent in this seizure was the recovery of 160 kg of raw gold from Mohali, the official said.

A total number of 2,142 FIRs were registered in connection with the seizures and 2,120 accused were arrested. 416 illegal weapons were also seized.

A total of 451 teams of flying squads and 504 static surveillance teams were functional throughout the state."
"RBI Raises Weekly Cash Withdrawal Limit To Rs. 50,000 From Feb 20, Limits End Mid-March","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/can-withdraw-rs-50-000-a-week-from-feb-20-no-limits-starting-march-13-1657253","New Delhi:                             Starting February 20, you can withdraw upto Rs. 50,000 per week from your savings account, the Reserve Bank of India said today, adding that from March 13, all caps on access to cash will end.

For now, the withdrawal per week for every savings account cannot exceed Rs. 24,000. Any money you pull out using an ATM machine counts towards this.

Restricted access to cash was announced on November 8 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he disclosed that within hours, 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would be abolished. People were given till the end of December to deposit the outlawed notes in accounts or swap them for new ones. Deposits over 2.5 lakhs would be scrutinized for tax evasion, the government said later.

The PM's demonetisation move was aimed at punishing tax evasion and corruption. Yesterday, he defended the timing of the reform - it was introduced in the middle of the festival and wedding season and as farmer were sowing their winter crop - and said that the notes ban could only have been induced when the economy was flourishing.

 The cash shortage that encompassed India in the weeks after the high-denomination notes were banned resulted in long lines at banks and ATMs. 86%of the currency in circulation had been sucked out in one go. The new, security-enhanced 500 and 2,000-rupee notes were in short supply, adding to the crunch. The pain was especially sharp in rural India with its limited access to banks and its complete dependence on cash transactions. The government has said the move has helped steer the economy towards digital transactions.

However, critics point out that there is no estimate yet from the RBI on how much of the abolished money has been returned to banks -most reports say virtually all the banned notes were turned in, demolishing the theory that black or untaxed money would be destroyed by the reform.

Elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh are being seen as the first real test of the PM's decision. He has, in one speech after another in the strategically vital state of Uttar Pradesh, stressed that the notes ban seeks to punish the corrupt and return to the poor ""what is rightfully theirs.""

Goa and Punjab voted last weekend. Uttar Pradesh votes across seven days, starting Saturday.  Results for all states, including Manipur and Uttarakhand, will be counted on March 11."
"LIVE: PM Narendra Modi's Speech In Aligarh During BJP's UP Campaign","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-pm-narendra-modis-speech-in-aligarh-during-bjps-up-campaign-1656178","Aligarh:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi is campaigned in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh today where he addressed a public meeting or rally. PM Modi is BJP's star campaigner which has not declared a chief ministerial candidate for UP.

Here are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech in Aligarh:Last time before the general elections when I visited Aligarh, the attendance was not even half of what it is today. I thank you all for your love and support.I see winds of change in Uttar Pradesh. The winds are fierce this time. The winds are so strong in favour of the BJP that the chief minister is holding on to just about anyone he can find.UP wants justice. Especially my sisters and mothers, my small time traders. This fight is for you.These days, people are issuing a fatwa against me every day. Because I am tightening the screws, because I am asking for an account of the crimes they committed over 70 years.It is shameful to see cases that have come to light here. It was found that people were withdrawing money of a widower's pension even when the woman does not exist. Tell me, is this not corruption? The corrupt are flourishing under the current UP administration. To stop this, from the Centre we have linked pension to Aadhaar and bank accounts. 40,000 crore that these rats would silently eat is now being saved.On November 8, I announced the banning of 500-and 1000-rupee notes. There was chaos amongst these corrupt people. They had to then deposit the money in bank accounts. We want that this money come to good use, for the benefit of our youth and development of our country. I am thankful to 1.2 billion people for supporting me.So many manufacturing plants were shut and Aligarh's famous locks came to use in order to lock them. You know the reason behind these plants shutting down? It happened because the UP government could not give them electricity.We are working day and night to ensure that every corner of India has electricity. We are making good progress. I am confident that electricity will reach every factory and household very soon. We are very close to achieving this. In fact we are working towards Uttar Pradesh's Vikas. By VIKAS I mean V - Vidyod (electricity), K - Kanoon (law and order), and S - Sadak (roads).The current government in Uttar Pradesh has nothing to do with vikas (development). But I want to assure the people of UP that we - the BJP - have taken this decision at the Centre to develop UP.Tell me, haven't you all faced injustice and discrimination? Let's take jobs for instance; Does one have to belong to a certain caste? or know someone who is connected politically to get a job? Is this what our constitution says? No. You all are facing this because of the current government in UP. They have failed you all. We will do our best to ensure that every young person in UP gets a job.Coming to the law and order situation in UP... Tell me, once the sun sets, can a sister or mother of any household leave their homes? Should women not have equal rights are men? Should the women be not given protection? I appeal to you all - my brothers and sisters - to save Uttar Pradesh from bullies and goons. Throw out these people who have done nothing for you, who have abandoned you, and left you without security. It is sad to see that if a person complaints about a bully or a goon, and he happens to be a relative of a politician, the complainant is scrapped. Are these the kind people who you want should run UP?To fight black money, corruption and counterfeit currency, we did demonetisation, then remonetised the economy and simultaneously started work of e-monetisation. We launched the BHIM app on Ambedkar's name. People questioned us, saying, what right does Narendra Modi have to use BR Ambedkar's name? I want to remind them that he was the economist under whom the Reserve Bank of India was formed. He was a great man and his contributions will never be forgotten. I don't care if people are jealous, but I will always honour him and hold him in highest regard."

Urging the Election Commission to increase security of EVMs, Senior AAP leader and Advocate HS Phoolka said, ""the surveillance of EVMs here should be increased as the arrangements are inadequate"".

The area surrounding the strong rooms needs enhanced security as AAP has noticed suspicious movement of some people around the 500-metre area surrounding the rooms, he said, adding that there can be an attempt to harm the EVMs.

The Aam Aadmi Party leader said his party has sent a letter to the Election Commission regarding the security issues and demanded that the number of security personnel should also be increased to ensure the safety and surveillance of the EVMs in the nine assembly constituencies.

Mr Phoolka said the movement of people in the area surrounding the strong rooms should also be controlled."

The Congress alleges that the Centre is soft on NSCN (IM), which is seen as the mastermind behind the blockade.

""We have been requesting the Centre that it has to talk to NSCN (IM) since it an pen truth that the UNC is working on their behest. It is the Centre who is talking peace with the NSCN(IM),"" said G Gaikhangam, deputy chief minister of Manipur.

The BJP was quick to counter the Congress' allegations.

""How can they say UNC is backed by NSCN(IM) and why do they not ban them. These are all baseless accusations. The Congress is to be blamed since it decided to create seven districts overnight,"" said N Biren Singh, a former Congress leader who is now with the BJP.

The UNC decided to continue with the protest despite signing an agreement earlier with the state government wherein the protestors agreed to consider lifting the blockade. The Centre had claimed that ""substantial progress"" was made to resolve the issue after the first round of talks between the stakeholders, held on February 3, in the national capital.

The over economic blockade - called by the UNC after the state government decided to bifurcate Naga dominated areas and create seven new districts - has crippled everyday life in Manipur. Long queues at fuel stations have become a common sight in the state capital of Imphal whereas LPG cylinders are being sold for Rs. 2,000 each in the black market."

Elections are due in Gujarat later this year. The decision was made by Mr Kejriwal after his return from campaigning in Punjab and was announced at a meeting of the party's highest decision making body - the Political Affairs Committee - at his home last night.  

Mr Kejriwal, who went to Bengaluru today for his annual health sojourn, has asked all division heads of the party to begin groundwork and go full throttle for both Gujarat election and the Delhi municipal election, which will also be held later this year. The national unit of the party will start working in Gujarat right away, while the Delhi unit will focus on the municipal elections.

AAP is hoping to expand its presence in a big way in Punjab and Goa, where the party contested all seats. In Punjab, it was seen as making a decisive impact, flying in planeloads of NRIs for its high-voltage campaign.

Gujarat has been a BJP heartland and the turf of PM Modi, who was Chief Minister of the state for 13 years before moving to the Centre. Sources in AAP said the party was hoping to cash in on what it described as the absence of a credible opposition.

Gulab Singh, the Delhi legislator who is in-charge of the party's Gujarat affairs, said the campaign will be aimed at ""freeing the people of Gujarat from the fear, corruption, injustice and exploitation prevalent under the present government"".

Mr Kejriwal has already recced Gujarat, holding several rallies there last year. After Mr Singh was arrested ahead of his rally in Surat, Mr Kejriwal had accused BJP chief Amit Shah of going out of his way to stop the rally. AAP sources said the campaign will give special attention to the BJP chief.

""AAP's strategy is to contest elections in states that have a two-cornered fight and where the opposition is weak,"" a leader said.  

For the Delhi civic body, currently dominated by the BJP, AAP will be basing its campaign on sanitation and corruption."

Sources in the Election Commission said the authorities had taken a slew of steps in this regard.

Estimates of the 2012 assembly election revealed that as many as 488 polling stations were vulnerable to heavy snowfall.

This year's revised figures stand at 803. The identified booths, spread over 35 assembly constituencies, are located in the state's high-altitude zones, which bear the brunt of heavy snowfall every winter, especially in January and February.

Uttarakhand Chief Electoral Officer Radha Raturi said, ""Keeping in mind the high altitude and inclement weather conditions, several arrangements are being made to ensure that polling parties in the 803 stations reach their destination on time and have all the necessary facilities to cope with the bad winter conditions.""

""Each of the 803 polling stations would witness 8,000-10,000 voters this year,"" she added. The EC would provide 5,302 sleeping bags, high-altitude shoes and jackets to the officials assigned to the poll-duty.

Uttarakashi has the maximum number of snow-affected polling stations in the state (318), followed by Nainital (85) and Dehradun (76). Except Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar district, all other 11 districts have polling stations which receive heavy snowfall during winters.

The EC has also identified 212 snow-affected roads in the state, the maximum being in Chamoli district.

The district administration has been put on high alert to ensure that snowfall does not pose a challenge in the upcoming polls.

Earlier in the month, there were reports of about 100 families in remote Pithoragarh who had decided to boycott the election and complained to the EC after the administration had failed to provide a proper road access to the villages."

""A child was delivered while standing in the queue, I honoured the name that bank employees gave him (Khazanchi) and provided support of 2 lakh,"" Mr Yadav, also the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief, said at a recent rally in Kanpur, reminding his audience that it was only the poor, and not the rich, who bore the brunt.

Khazanchi's mother Sarvesha Devi had waited for five hours outside a bank branch in Jhinjhak town when she went into labour. The baby boy is her fifth child, born after the recent death of her husband, a snake charmer.

Bank employees and others suggested the newborn be named Khazanchi, which means treasurer or cashier. She agreed.

In times of elections, Khazanchi has been introduced early to the world of politics.

Well before he turned a month old, Akhilesh Yadav awarded Rs 2 lakh to his mother in a move perceived to be high on political symbolism; a high profile election in the state was just around the corner.

Back in their village around 40 km from the district headquarters, which has about 450 voters from backward castes, Khazanchi is fast asleep on the only cot the family has, outside their mud house.

""Yes, this baby boy has given me hope that I can survive,"" says Sarvesha Devi, sharing her daily struggle to make ends meet.

What is her view of the government's overnight ban on high value currency notes, which forced millions like her to spend hours in queues outside banks and ATMs for cash? She shrugs, ""Don't ask me about politics. I have no idea.""

Aruna Kori, a junior culture minister in Akhilesh government and local SP candidate for the Rasulabad seat that goes to vote on 19 February, conceded Khazanchi was a ""big part of her election campaign"". ""At least Akhilesh helped the child,"" she says, a rebuttal to BJP leaders who insist the baby's birth ""doesn't really prove anything"".

Kori's rival from the BJP, Nirmala Shankhwar, responded: ""If he is a star, he is a star for everyone and not just one political party... In the villages everyone is saying the notes ban was absolutely good""."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Samajwadi Party-Congress Alliance To See 'Unfriendly Contests' In Dozen Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-samajwadi-party-cong-alliance-to-see-unfriendly-contest-in-dozen-seats-1657880","Lucknow:                             The catchy one-liner ""UP ko ye saath pasand hai"" dotting the Uttar Pradesh skyline does not seem to be reflected on the ground as fledgling alliance partners Samajwadi Party and Congress are crossing swords in over a dozen Assembly seats.

""Yes, there are some seats on which candidates of both the parties are challenging each other. The issue will be resolved,"" Samajwadi Party Chief Spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury told PTI when asked to comment on the issue.

Even Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar said the matter would be sorted out in a couple of days.

""Leaders of both parties will campaign in support of candidates declared by the alliance on the seats where nominees of both sides have filed their papers,"" he said. But, political observers said with only a day left for the first phase polling on February 11 the damage seems to have been done already with candidates of both parties already on the ground.

""The alliance is set to witness some unfriendly contest in these seats,"" said a political expert.

The situation is worse in the Gandhi family pocket borough - Amethi and Raebareli - represented by Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi in the Lok Sabha.

There are 10 assembly seats in Amethi and Raebareli. In Raebareli's Sareni seat, Ashok Singh (Congress) and Devendra Pratap Singh (Samajwadi Party) are challenging each other.

Likewise, in Unchahar Ajay Pal Singh (Congress) is facing cabinet minister Manoj Kumar Pandey (Samajwadi Party).

In Amethi, sitting MLA and Mulayam Singh Yadav loyalist Gayatri Prasad Prajapati is in the fray on SP ticket, while Congress has decided to field Amita Singh there.

In Gauriganj seat too, confusion prevails with Congress candidate Mohd Naeem challenging Rakesh Pratap Singh (Samajwadi Party).

The UP Pradesh Congress Committee chief, however, made light of the issue saying, Samajwadi Party candidates had filed their nomination papers when it appeared that the alliance will not come through.

""At some places they wanted to withdraw, they could not do so due to uncertainty,"" he said.

"Yes, Want Triple Talaq Totally Abolished, Says Law Minister RS Prasad","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/triple-talaq-blatantly-unconstitutional-law-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-to-ndtv-1656585","New Delhi:                             A day after his comments on triple talaq made headlines in the backdrop of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told NDTV that ideally, the government wants it to be abolished completely and not settle for the traditional three-month reconciliation period stipulated by Shariat.

""The ideal (situation) would be that triple talaq should go... if the 3-month period is allowed to go it can go, but will the discrimination continue thereafter?"" Mr Prasad said. ""The world over, divorce with mutual consent is the norm.""

While triple talaq -- the practice of Muslim men getting an instant divorce by saying ""talaq"" thrice - has come under intense criticism from the courts and the civil society, the elections in Uttar Pradesh, a state with a sizeable population of Muslims, has brought in under political scrutiny again.  

The opposition has accused the Law Minister of playing up the issue to influence voting in Uttar Pradesh. The seven-phase election will start in the state from February 11.

The Supreme Court is currently hearing several petitions on triple talaq. Women have alleged that they were being divorced via Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken on the issue, saying the government could not allow the lives of Muslim women to be ruined by triple talaq.

Admitting that it was an election issue for his party, Mr Prasad dared the state's ruling Samajwadi Party, its ally Congress, and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party to make their stands clear.

""The government had conveyed this to the Supreme Court in its affidavit more than 3 months ago, even before the elections were announced. I am not shifting the goalposts, they are,"" Mr Prasad said of the opposition.

""Uttar Pradesh is a big state. A lot of Muslim women come from that state. They have complained about Triple Talaq. Many of them have shared stories of victimisation,"" he said.

The law minister added, ""We respect freedom of religion and faith. But every pernicious practice can't be part of religion. Twenty countries have abolished or regulated triple talaq. Even Islamic countries have banned it."""

The statues built when Mayawati was the chief minister were covered in the 2012 Assembly polls on the orders of the election commission.

To a question on the possibility of covering statues of Mayawati and elephants, Chief Election Commissioner Naseem Zaidi on Thursday said, ""The Supreme Court has given directives in this connection and we have also given some guidelines in its pursuance... this issue is no more under the consideration of the commission.""

The CEC however did not elaborate on the directives of the apex court or poll panel guidelines in this regard. Mr Zaidi was here to review poll preparations in the 73 seats of western Uttar Pradesh which are going to polls on Saturday in the first of the seven phased Assembly elections.

To another question, Mr Zaidi said those who had migrated from Kairana for any reason will be extended security if they take part in the polling process in their respective areas.

Stressing that representatives of various political parties and officials met the commission in the past two days in Lucknow, Mr Zaidi said officials have been asked to give a declaration if any of their relatives is in poll fray so that a check could be maintained on them.

Besides, orders have been issued to transfer within 48 hours officials who have been posted at a particular place for three years, the CEC said, adding the poll panel has summoned records of all police station in-charges and action will be taken against all those found lax.

To a question on BJP's demand for removal of the chief secretary and the DGP of the state, he said the matter is in election commission's knowledge.

In order to check distribution of liquor to voters during elections, the excise department has set up checkposts at the inter-state borders as well as along the border with Nepal, he said, adding the commission has set up a police cell to keep tab on messages received through WhatsApp and social media.

Mr Zaidi said those who reach the polling centre by 5 pm will be allowed to cast their votes even if it meant that the polling parties have to overstay.

Also arrangements will be made to airlift any polling staff who falls ill on duty and ensure his treatment, he said."

Welcoming him into the party-fold, Mr Fernandes said his induction would benefit the party in Uttar Pradesh.

""After Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi approved his joining, Umed Singh has joined the Congress party. We welcome him into the party-fold. I am sure the party will benefit from him in Uttar Pradesh,"" he said.

Mr Singh has come back into the Congress from Bahujan Samaj Party, which he had joined after quitting the Congress. He enjoys support in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh where Phoolan Devi hailed from.

Mr Singh has contested the Lok Sabha election thrice. In 2014, he contested from Shahjahanpur on a BSP ticket after he joined it in 2012.

In 2003, Singh was formally inducted into the Haryana Congress.

The then Haryana Congress president Dharampal Singh was also present along with him on Tuesday.

""I was in Congress earlier and I have realised that all sections can progress only under the Congress,"" Umed Singh said, adding that ""we want a Congress party government to be formed at the Centre in 2019"".

Asked if he would contest Assembly elections in UP, he said he would abide by the directions of party leaders.

Two years after her release from prison, Phoolan Devi was elected as MP from the Mirzapur Lok Sabha seat in 1996. She served as an MP in the 11th Lok Sabha (1996-98), but lost her seat in 1998 election. She was re-elected in 1999 election and was the sitting member of Parliament for Mirzapur when she was assassinated."

Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal hopes to regain lost ground in the state
Both RLD and BJP are courting Jat voters, hoping to win big in UP
                                About 10 km before you enter Muzzafarnagar town in western Uttar Pradesh, a massive security barricade is manned by many paramilitary personnel in olive green fatigues and holding automatic weapons. In this sugar belt of UP, the extra security deployed by the Election Commission is a reminder of the 2013 clashes between Jats and Muslims that claimed over 60 lives. Months later, the Jats of western UP, once the core support base of Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal, voted en masse for the BJP in a polarised national election of 2014. The BJP took all the seats in the region.

Ajit Singh and his son, Jayant Chaudhary, are trying to regain lost ground in what is seen as their fight to stay relevant when the region votes on Saturday in the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. In 2012, Ajit Singh's party had won all its nine seats in western UP, the number shrinking in comparison to earlier elections.

The RLD's pitch this time is simple. It says the BJP has not kept the promises it made to the Jats in 2014 - its government at the Centre has not given them reservation in government jobs, the hike in procurement prices for sugarcane farmers isn't substantial and it has done little to ensure that sugar mill owners pay arrears to farmers.

""Lok Dal people are straightforward and not like others who lie,"" Jayant Chaudhary told a gathering of RLD supporters and urged them to take his message to every village in the area. ""The RLD is the only party that can bridge the divide between communities,"" he added as he wrapped up and flew away in a helicopter for his next public meeting in Mathura.
 In 2012, Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal party had won all its nine seats in western Uttar Pradesh.Ajit Rathee, who heads the RLD in Muzzafarnagar, said, ""The main issue here is that of farmers. Neither the Centre nor the state government has given anything to them. That's why our supporters, our Jat brothers have come back to our party.""

The BJP knows it will find it difficult to repeat its 2014 sweep of the region if the Jats abandon it. BJP candidates are stoutly countering the RLD, claiming their leaders are doing their best to get farmers their due.

Vijay Kashyap, a non-Jat BJP candidate in the Charthawal constituency of Muzzafarnagar talks about how union minister Sanjeev Baliyan, a parliamentarian from the region, ensured that sugar mills paid arrears to sugarcane growers. ""There was a payment problem with the sugar mills were but Balyan ensured that we got farmers our money,"" said Mr Kashyap.
 To avoid situations like last time, Election Commission deployed extra security.At a village gathering next to the Titavi sugar mill, opinion was clearly divided. The older Jats here were angry that the BJP has not honoured its commitments; they also talked nostalgically about Ajit Singh's father and former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, still considered the tallest Jat leader in these parts. The younger ones said there was still time for the ruling party to come good on its promises.

UP votes in seven phases starting Saturday, when polling will be held for 73 of 403 seats in the state. Unlike the rest of the state, where most seats will see tight contests between the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, the BJP and Mayawati's BSP, in the sugarcane belt of western UP, the RLD will make it a four-cornered fight.

Votes will be counted on March 11."

He said the margin will be even bigger than last time when the Akali-BJP combine had formed the government for the second time consecutively. For years, Punjab had alternated between the Akali Dal and the Congress. The Akalis in 2012 assembly elections had won 56 of state's 117 seats, and its ally the BJP had won 12, to form the government under Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal.

For the debutant, the Aam Aadmi Party, which had jolted Punjab politics by winning four seats in Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and had later wiped out the ruling Congress in 2015 Delhi assembly elections and reduced BJP to a mere three seats, Mr Badal said would be a distant third when the results are announced on March 11.

The SAD president Sukhbir Badal is fighting from Jalalabad and is challenged by comic-turned politician and AAP lawmaker Bhagwant Mann, who is among the frontrunners for chief minister's post if the party wins.

The elections in Punjab will also see a stiff battle in Lambi, the home turf of the Akalis and the seat of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, where he is challenged by Congress' chief ministerial candidate and state president Captain Amarinder Singh and AAP's Jarnail Singh.

Parkash Singh Badal, once the youngest Chief Minister of Punjab in 1970 at the age of 43, will retain the top spot if Akali-BJP government creates history with a third consecutive win. Congress' Captain Amarinder Singh who is taking on the Chief Minster has declared this to be his last elections.

Also in the fray is Sukhbir Badal's estranged cousin and an erstwhile minister in Akali government Manpreet Badal, who is now fighting on a Congress ticket. On the challenge from his own family member, Sukhbir Badal said he was sure to be defeated from Bhatinda.

Countering the anti-incumbency after two consecutive terms, the Akali Dal will be aided by the support of Sirsa's powerful sect Dera Sacha Sauda which has declared its support for the Akali-BJP combine."

Badal village is part of the Lambi assembly constituency which the chief minister represents.

""We will win easily. Punjab is looking forward to peace and development,"" the 89-year-old chief minister said after voting.

Mr Badal is locked in a mega prestige battle with Congress's chief ministerial candidate Captain Amarinder Singh, 75, in Lambi. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has fielded Jarnail Singh here take on the two big political heavyweights.

Since 1997, Mr Badal has contested and won from Lambi, but in the last election his margin of victory over the Congress candidate was about 25,000 votes, not a big gap for the presumptive chief minister of the winning side.

""We will register a better victory this time. Amarinder Singh will lose his security deposit,"" Sukhbir Singh Badal, who is the president of the Shiromani Akali Dal, told the media after casting his vote.

Sukhbir Singh Badal is himself locked in another mega battle in Jalalabad with Bhagwant Mann, seen as AAP's leading contender for chief minister if the party wins.

Parkash Singh Badal's Shiromani Akali Dal, in alliance with the BJP, has ruled Punjab for two straight terms - 10 years. Parkash Singh Badal's career is seven decades long and he has been Punjab chief minister five times, the first 47 years ago, when he became the country's youngest chief minister in 1970.

Move motivated, comes just ahead of key polls in Punjab, Goa: Kejriwal
                                After the Income Tax department's report alleging enough discrepancies in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)'s donation records to strip it of its political party status, Arvind Kejrwal today called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a ""shameless dictator"".

The tax department has claimed in a report to the Election Commission that audit reports prepared by AAP for donations amounting to about Rs. 27 crore are false.

Records of donations made to the four-year-old party between 2013 and 2015 has ""factual discrepancies"" that do not match the money it received from donors, says the department, which has reportedly been investigating AAP's donations for over a year.

Parties prepare audit reports in consultation with their charted accountants, and submit a copy to the I-T department as per law.
 Led by Arvind Kejriwal, the Aam Aadmi Party is debuting in Punjab and Goa elections.Officials said AAP's Treasurer has acknowledged ""certain errors"" in these records in their communication with the taxman.

The Income Tax report, they say, suggests violations of tax laws that govern political donations. AAP should lose tax exemptions and should be ""de-registered"", tax officials have reportedly suggested, but only the powerful Election body can decide.

AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal blamed the tax report on ""Modiji's dirty tricks"". The Delhi Chief Minister also said the government is targeting his party because the BJP is headed for a defeat in the Punjab and Goa elections, where voting takes place on Saturday.

""Modiji's dirty tricks. Losing badly in Goa n Punjab, he tries to de-register the winning party 24 hrs before elections. Shameless dictator,"" Mr Kejriwal tweeted.

The AAP believes it has a good shot in Punjab, where it is locked in a triangular contest with the Congress and the ruling Akali Dal-BJP combine. In Goa too, Mr Kejriwal believes his party will make a good debut."

"Goa Elections 2017: Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar On Why He Has Lost 4 Kg In Delhi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-elections-2017-lost-4-kgs-in-delhi-miss-goan-food-says-manohar-parrikar-on-talks-of-his-ret-1655937","Panaji: HighlightsManohar Parrikar has been a two-time Chief Minister of Goa
He was elevated to the Union Cabinet as Defence Minister in 2014
He could make a comeback in state politics following the Goan election
                                Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was an early voter in Goa capital Panaji today. He had queued up before polling booths opened and was done by 7:10 am. He then told reporters, who have had just one question for him for weeks, ""I have lost 4 kg in Delhi because of the food. I like Goan food. You can interpret this the way you want.""

Goa is abuzz with speculation that Mr Parrikar could return to the state as chief minister if the BJP is re-elected. Top BJP leaders like party chief Amit Shah and union minister Nitin Gadkari have while campaigning hinted that a Parrikar comeback is not ruled out. Mr Parrikar has refused to comment on what he calls ""mere assumptions"" but seems to enjoy handing out abstract statements like he did today.

Goan Fish Curry over Butter Chicken of course, he said today, also stating that he is a ""party man, let the party decide."" Mr Parrikar was chief minister when he was called up for union cabinet duty to New Delhi. He installed in his place loyalist Laxmikant Parsekar, who has struggled to fill Mr Parrikar's big shoes.
 Manohar Parrikar came to the polling station just after voting began at 7 am today
Mr Parrikar, who has a big following in Goa and considered key for BJP to be re-elected, has been in the coastal state for the last few weeks to craft the BJP's campaign strategy and oversee its execution.

The BJP is seen to be keeping voters engaged with its guessing game as it attempts to replicate its win of 2012. Five years ago Manohar Parrikar had led the party to victory with strategic alliances. The Defence Minister, who has been Goa chief minister twice, remains the BJP's most popular leader in the state and is called the ""super chief minister.""

This year BJP and regional party MGP are fighting separately; the MGP has tied up with two other parties including one led by Subhash Velingkar, who was sacked by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor, and has vowed revenge against the party.

It also has to factor in Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party that debuts in Goa this time, fielding a popular former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate. There is also the Congress which has tried to consolidate after losing the state to the BJP in the last election.
""It is a four-cornered contest, but three corners are very weak,"" Mr Parrikar said sticking to his assessment that the BJP will get a two-thirds majority. The party had won 21 of the state's 40 seats last time. It is contesting 36 seats this year. The four seats have independent candidates backed by the BJP.

Mr Parrikar said he expects the voter turnout to cross 85 per cent this time. By 11 am that seemed possible with 34 per cent votes cast in brisk polling. The Defence Minister claimed credit. ""Goa votes very heavy and this is a speciality that the BJP has inducted in the politics of the state. Initial indications are good,"" he said.

Asked by NDTV, Gen Singh who is fighting his first electoral battle, insisted that he wasn't a parachute candidate.

""First and foremost, I am not a parachute candidate. I have been brought up here. I spent five years of my life here as a child. Therefore, I cannot forget those lovely years,"" the Akali Dal candidate said, responding to rivals who have called him an outsider to Patiala.

Barring the death of a 78-year-old man outside a polling booth in Panaji city, no untoward incident has been reported from anywhere in the state.

Election Commission of India's data from various polling booth showed that about 53 per cent of 11.10 lakh voters turned up to exercise franchise in the first six hours.

An impressive 83 per cent voting was recorded in the state in 2012 assembly polls, which saw the BJP wresting power from the Congress.

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, widely seen as the chief ministerial face of the BJP, Union minister Shripad Naik and Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar were among the early voters who cast their ballots.

Long queues were seen outside almost all the polling stations right from the morning in the state.

Except for minor incidents of EVM failures, which were soon rectified, and cancellation of voting in one booth, polling is progressing peacefully in over 1,642 booths across the state, to decide the fate of 250 contestants in the fray.

The election is being closely fought by major political forces BJP, Congress, AAP and MGP-led alliance, who have mounted a hectic campaign.

The polls will decide future of Goa's five former chief ministers Churchill Alemao, Pratapsinh Rane, Ravi Naik, Digambar Kamat and Luizinho Faleiro and the incumbent Lxmikant Parsekar.

BJP has put up 36 aspirants, Congress 37 and AAP is contesting on 39 seats, and each of them backing independents in a few seats.

BJP, which had a pre-poll alliance in 2012, is going it alone this time, after the MGP called-off the partnership and forged a front with Goa Suraksha Manch floated by RSS rebel Subhas Velingkar and Shiv Sena.

Leslie Saldanha, 78, who was waiting to cast his vote in Panaji collapsed and died, officials said.

Mr Saldanha was immediately rushed to Goa Medical College and Hospital but he was declared brought in dead."

He said the ruling Akali-BJP combine and debutant the Aam Aadmi Party were way behind the Congress according to early reports on voting in Punjab. Mr Singh who is fighting from Patiala, his home turf, against Akali candidate and former army chief General JJ Singh, has also challenged Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal from his traditional seat of Lambi.

The performance of AAP, poised as a disrupter in the state which has elected the Akali Dal and the Congress in alternate elections, is being watched with keen interest as the four-year-old party attempts to extend its influence beyond Delhi, where it swept assembly elections two years ago.

But Mr Singh says the Congress is the 'new dawn' that Punjab needs. ""The people have voted for stability versus communal and radical politics. The people of Punjab want the experience and expertise of Congress to get the state back on the rails of progress and development, Mr Singh said.

Mr Singh said the Shiromani Akali Dal has ""ripped apart the state's social, religious and economic fabric"" and its ally both in the state and at the centre, the BJP, was equally responsible.

""People don't want SAD's mafia and communal ideology, nor do they want AAP's radical extremism,"" Mr Singh said, adding, ""People have voted for securing the future of their children. Punjab stands at the brink of a positive change, and Congress is all set to provide it.""

Punjab votes today in a single phase. The results for the state - along with Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur - will be announced on March 11.

The former state finance minister, who quit the Shiromani Akali Dal in 2010 following a fallout with his uncle's government, rejected the notion that he has mixed emotions about fighting his cousins in the crucial state polls.

""There are no mixed emotions because I was trained that loyalty must always be for India and Punjab. Loyalty cannot be graded with your family or friends,"" he said.

""Ministers are usually sacked on account of a scandal or corruption. It was probably the first time in the history of India that a finance minister resigned from the cabinet because he did not agree with the policies of his own government,"" Mr Manpreet added, referring to his resignation in 2010.

He also spoke about the experiences of forming the People's Party of Punjab, which eventually merged with the Congress.

""Whatever change we tried to bring: curbing VIP culture, breaking the nexus between the police and politicians, and getting Punjab free from debt. I think there are no emotions involved. These things must be done,"" he further stated.

Interestingly, he arrived at the polling booth in an open jeep which, he told NDTV, he considers ""lucky"".

""This is my lucky jeep,"" said Mr Manpreet. ""This is my favourite jeep. It is a former Indian military jeep. It used to be fitted with a recoilless gun. It has always proved lucky for me as it has proved lucky for the Indian Army.""

He was announced as Congress' chief ministerial candidate in Punjab
Amarinder Singh is the former Chief Minister of Punjab and ex-Amritsar MP
                                A red carpet rolled out in a polling booth in Patiala where Capitan Amarinder Singh and his family will cast their vote triggered accusations from rival parties that the special treatment was aimed at the Congress' chief ministerial candidate, a local royal.

Patiala is one of the two assembly seats from where Amarinder Singh is contesting.

Lambi constituency - a four-hour long drive from Patiala - is the other. There, Amarinder Singh has challenged Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal of the Akali Dal who has never lost an election from this seat since 1997.

It is in Patiala - where he is pitted against Akali Dal candidate, India's first Sikh Army chief JJ Singh - however, that Amarinder Singh is at home. His forefathers were Maharajas of Patiala. 

As polling started early this morning, there were murmurs of protest from polling agents of rival parties at the VIP polling booth.

Flustered at the attention that the special arrangements were getting, election officials initially rolled back the red carpet.

It was, however, rolled out again, sometime later.

Election officials brushed aside charges that the special treatment was targeted at an individual voter, or a candidate.

The Election Commission had come up with the concept of a model polling booth during elections to the 2015 Delhi Legislative Assembly. A red carpet welcome of the voters and flowers being presented to them was one part of the concept. 

""One important defining fact for such a value addition would be the actual experience of the voter at the polling station on the day of voting,"" the Election Commission's manual says, outlining facilities that a model booth should have including standby arrangement in case of power cuts."

""You have to ask Mr Parrikar,"" Mr Parsekar, who is contesting from the Mandrem constituency, said when asked about the Defence Minister's possible homecoming. He added that the next chief minister will be ""decided by the MLAs"".

""It is not a new thing,"" Mr Parsekar said.

The chief minister also equated the assembly election in Goa to an examination.

""We are contesting the polls after a successful tenure in Goa. It is an examination for the BJP's performance over the last five years,"" he said.

""I don't anyone has achieved what the BJP has achieved in the last five years in terms of infrastructure - bridges, roads, hospitals, parks, market complexes. We also managed to formulate a network of social welfare schemes which benefits every deserving household,"" the chief minister claimed.

He also reflected upon the performance of the BJP in the last five years as well as the BJP's agenda for the next five years, should they win.

""This election is very crucial for the future of Goa. Our first agenda is the creation of jobs and the eradication of unemployment,"" he further stated.

""There is no feeling of anti-incumbency in any constituency. I am confident that the BJP is retaining the state with absolute and clear majority,"" a confident Laxmikant Parsekar said.

Mr Parsekar was appointed Goa's Chief Minister after Manohar Parrikar was elevated to the Union Cabinet as Defence Minister in 2014. However, Mr Parrikar could make a comeback in state politics after BJP's national president said that the new Goa government would work under the leadership of Mr Parrikar, should the BJP retain power in the state.

"'UP Will Turn Into Kashmir:' BJP Lawmaker Yogi Adityanath Attacks Akhilesh Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-will-turn-into-kashmir-bjp-lawmaker-yogi-adityanath-attacks-akhilesh-yadav-1655484","Bulandshahr:                             Yogi Adityanath, lawmaker and top BJP crowd puller, today said Western Uttar Pradesh will ""turn into Kashmir and will see a mass exodus,"" if Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party is not removed from power. The sensitive region, which saw deadly riots three years ago, votes next week in the first phase of the UP assembly elections.  

The BJP alleges that over 300 Hindu families have fled their homes in Kairana, a Muslim-dominated Western UP town, which is denied by the Samajwadi Party government that says an inquiry has revealed no mass immigration based on religious grounds. Yogi Adityanath alleged today that the number is actually much more and that the SP was suppressing facts.

""Kairana is just one town. There are dozens of villages where an exodus is happening. Women were being harassed and so families were forced to leave. Please go there and see. They don't register FIRs in crimes committed on Hindus,"" the five-time MP from Gorakhpur told NDTV.

He said the comparison with Kashmir, where 3.5 lakh Pandits left the Valley in fear in the 1990s, is fair because, ""if left unchecked, the situation will be similar.""

BJP chief Amit Shah has brought up the issue repeatedly during his campaign in UP and while releasing the party's manifesto last week promised a white paper, saying the BJP, if elected, would make government officials responsible for the safe return of the ""migrated population.""

Both regional heavyweights the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party as well as the Congress have accused the BJP of polarising voters, especially in Western UP where 62 people were killed in the 2013 communal violence. Months later, the BJP swept UP in the general elections winning 71 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats. Among the winners were leaders like Hukum Singh, who first made the Kairana allegation and who is accused of inciting violence in Muzaffarnagar, the epicentre of the riots.    

Yogi Adityanath was speaking today in Sikanderabad, in Bulandshahr and an area that has a Muslim and Dalit majority population. While the Bulandshahr gang-rape figured in his speech, he used the metaphor of rape more in the context of crimes along communal lines and not just a law and order problem. ""It is not just Hindus but Dalits are also leaving. So we must vote out these people who practice identity politics,"" the 44-yer-old priest-politician alleged.

Some days ago the controversial lawmaker had raised eyebrows by welcoming US President Donald Trump's ""Muslim ban"". Today, he played that down but made no attempt to conceal his admiration for America's new president.

Yogi Adityanath's army of supporters in eastern UP have put the BJP on notice demanding that he be named presumptive Chief Minister in UP, where elections will be held in seven phases and votes will be counted on March 11. They have threatened to field candidates to spoil the chances of the BJP's official nominees. But Mr Adityanath denies any rebellion.

""I don't care about such posts. I am for ideology and only here to defeat the SP and BSP,"" he said.

Rebel or not, Yogi Adityanath clearly has star status in the BJP - the party has assigned him a chopper to zip across the state to campaign, as the party attempts to win the state back after 15 years."

"Uttarakhand Elections 2017: Parties Try To Work Out The 'Fauji Factor'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-elections-2017-parties-try-to-work-out-the-fauji-factor-1655124","Dehradun:                             Uttarakhand, which goes to vote for its 70 Assembly seats in just two weeks, produces the highest number of Indian army officers per capita of the population. Nearly 30 per cent of the electorate comprises servicemen, ex-servicemen and their families. In the upcoming state elections, thus political parties are trying their best to woo the 'fauji' vote-bank.

BJP legislator from Mussoorie Ganesh Joshi, who was accused of assaulting police horse 'Shaktiman' during protest and arrested after a national outrage over the incident, claims over 6,000 ex-servicemen are supporting him alone. Canvassing in Kandli village, Mr Joshi said, ""You can see it for yourself. I asked them (ex-servicemen) how much did you get after the government announced OROP (One Rank One Pension) and they said that after sixty years if there is anyone who has fulfilled our promise, it is the BJP.""

""Never before had surgical strikes happened in this way; it sends a message that the BJP government is both willing and ready to do something for its people"", said Bhawani Singh, an ex-servicemen campaigning for Mr Joshi.

""This (BJP) government has made everything digital. Not only have they increased the pension, one can also access it more easily now,"" added Hari Kang, another second generation retired soldier from the same regiment.

In neighbouring Nangnath village however, families of the faujis seemed more taken in by the Congress candidate Godawari Thapli, who enjoys the support of the Gurkha which community has an electoral base of 12 lakh and harbour a formidable reputation in the army.

""We are fauji families whose sons are still serving in the army. As of now we are with the Congress. Let's see what happens ahead,"" adds 28-year-old Anjana.

The Congress has condemned the BJP for making OROP and the surgical strikes a political issue. ""It is sad and unfortunate that the BJP has for the first time politicized our armed forces,"" said state Congress committee chief Kishor Upadhyay to NDTV. The irony however is that Chief Minister Harish Rawat himself recently declared a proposal for the opening of a ministry for soldiers and ex-servicemen by March 2017 if elected to power.

""I don't believe the promises that either government makes,"" says an irate Brig. KG Behl, former president of the Uttarakhand Ex-Servicemen League. ""Despite the fact that we constitute about 30 per cent of the state, our people are still very divided. There was once even a proposal of forming a different political a party for soldiers but it fizzled out,"" said the retired Brigadier.

""I feel that by and large people will be attracted to the amount of OROP and surgical strikes but it will be limited to ex-servicemen in urban areas. In rural areas, where people still don't know about the importance of OROP because they don't have TVs, the pattern of voting will be different,"" said Col. PL Prashar, also from the UESL."

The Majha (north of river Beas) and Doaba (area between Beas and Sutlej rivers) belts were catching up in voting percentage, election officials said. Amritsar and Ropar districts recorded the lowest turnout at less than 60 per cent till 5 pm.

For the first time, Punjab witnessed three-cornered contests on all seats, between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The enthusiasm of voters was almost equal in rural and urban areas.

Braving the winter chill, thousands of voters turned out in the morning to cast their votes.

Long queues were seen at most polling stations as voting began in all the assembly constituencies from 8 am. Many had reached the poll booths much before the exercise started.

Over 1.98 crore voters would decide the fate of 1,145 candidates, including 81 women and a lone transgender. There are over six lakh first time voters this time.

Voting for the by-election to the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat was also held on Saturday.

Voting at different polling stations in Punjab was disrupted or delayed for periods ranging from five minutes to over an hour on Saturday due to technical snags in electronic voting machines (EVMs).

The Election Department used 31,460 EVMs in the one-day assembly elections. There were 22,614 polling stations in the state.

First-time voters were issued certificates by district authorities in various constituencies.

Among early voters were former Army chief Gen JJ Singh (Patiala city) of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and former Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal (Badal village) of the Congress.

Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, 89, his son and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and daughter-in-law and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal cast their votes in Badal village, which is part of Mr Badal senior's Lambi assembly constituency.

""We will win easily. Punjab is looking forward to peace and development,"" the Chief Minister said after voting.

Mr Badal is being challenged for the Lambi seat by Punjab Congress President and former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and AAP's Jarnail Singh.

Sukhbir Badal is facing a challenge from two sitting MPs - Bhagwant Mann (AAP) and Ravneet Singh Bittu (Congress), for the Jalalabad assembly seat.

Amarinder Singh, accompanied by his wife and former Union Minister of State for External Affairs Preneet Kaur, and other family members, voted in Patiala city.

""I am sure that we (Congress) are winning this election comfortably,"" Mr Singh told media.

Others to cast their votes included cricketer-turned-politician and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu (Amritsar-east), former Olympian and now Congress leader Pargat Singh (Jalandhar Cantt), Sucha Singh Chhotepur (Gurdaspur) of Apna Punjab Party and Congress leaders Sunil Jakhar (Aboha) and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal (Lehra).

Cricketer Harbhajan Singh and Sufi singer Hans Raj Hans voted in polling stations in Jalandhar.

Tight security arrangements were in place across Punjab, with over 100,000 security personnel deployed, and borders with neighbouring states sealed.

The counting of votes will take place on March 11.

In the 2012 assembly elections, 78.57 per cent of voters had exercised their franchise."

"Goa Elections 2017: Why BJP's Michael Lobo, Who Once Washed Dishes, Is Sure He Will Win","http://www.ndtv.com/goa-news/goa-elections-2017-why-bjps-michael-lobo-who-once-washed-dishes-is-sure-he-will-win-1655420","Panaji:                             Michael Lobo, BJP legislator from Goa's Calangute, is the envy of voters in neighbouring constituencies. His supporters believe the ruling party, which has not named a chief ministerial candidate for Goa, will do well to project the 40-year-old for the top post.
   
""I know I'm popular because I'm a man from Goa. I interact with people and know about their problems. I'll win with full majority. You can interview me again on the March 11"", he told NDTV.


Michael Lobo's popularity in the constituency is built around his reputation as a hands-on MLA. He stands at the site to inspect all work on roads, an important agenda in Goa.

""I am a builder myself. I make sure I keep an eye on the work myself. Engineers can be lazy sometimes,"" Mr Lobo said.

Mr Lobo is also credited with getting Goa its first state-of-the-art solid waste treatment plant as garbage management has been an issue in the state.

""I started working when I was 13. My father was unwell and I had to support my family. I dropped out after first year because I didn't have enough money, but made sure my elder sister completed her graduation"", Mr Lobo said.

He washed dishes at a restaurant, became a waiter before becoming a manager. Today, he owns three resorts and six restaurants in the Baga-Calangute area.

Michael Lobo is credited with getting Goa its first state of the art solid waste treatment plant.

""He is always available for us. Other constituencies are jealous because we have an MLA like him,"" said Harry Masparenhas, 52, who owns a small eatery near Baga.

""He will be the next Chief Minister,"" said another worker.

The BJP, which hopes to get reelected in Goa, had dropped hints that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, Goa's most popular BJP man, could return if the party is elected to power again. In Calangute, residents say if Mr Parrikar does not return, Michael Lobo would be a better pick rather than Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, who took charge when Mr Parrikar was called to Delhi on national duty."
"Punjab Elections 2017: 35 Per Cent Voter Turnout Across State Till 1 PM","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-elections-2017-35-per-cent-voter-turnout-in-punjab-till-1-pm-1655999","Chandigarh:                             Brisk polling was going on as around 35 per cent of the total 1.98 crore electors exercised their franchise till 1 PM in the high-stakes Punjab Assembly elections, wherein 1,145 candidates are in the fray.

""35 per cent polling has taken place till 1 PM,"" an election office spokesman said in Chandigarh. ""Polling is going peacefully,"" Additional Director General of Police (ADGP-elections) VK Bhawra said.

Meanwhile, a technical snag was reported in voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines in Majitha and Sangrur, the spokesman said, adding that the matter had been referred to the Election Commission. Voting started around 45 minutes late at two polling booths in Jalandhar and Amritsar due to technical glitches in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).

Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia was unable to cast his vote in the morning due to the technical snag in EVM at polling station number 35, Ward number 5 in Majitha constituency in Amritsar district.

Among those who had cast their vote so far included Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, his wife and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Congress vetran Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.

Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh and his wife Preneet Kaur had also cast their votes.

""Seeking my mother's blessings before casting my vote. Let this be a new dawn for Punjab!"" Amarinder Singh tweeted.

Former Army chief General JJ Singh (retd) of the Akali Dal, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pargat Singh of Congress, Sucha Singh Chhotepur of Apna Punjab Party (APP), and Bhagwant Mann, Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi and Sukhpal Singh Khaira of the Aam Aadmi Party also cast their votes.

Cricketer Harbhajan Singh along with his mother Avtar Kaur also exercised their franchise. The polling for 117 Punjab assembly seats is being held in a single phase amid tight security.

Punjab is witnessing a three-cornered contest between ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance, opposition Congress and new entrant Aam Aadmi Party.

Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has fielded candidates in 94 seats while its ally BJP has nominated candidates in the remaining 23 seats. Congress is contesting alone on all seats. AAP, which is contesting the state polls for the first time, has fielded candidates in 112 seats while its ally Lok Insaf Party, led by Ludhiana-based Bains brothers, has fielded nominees in five seats.

Other political outfits in the fray include BSP, former AAP leader Sucha Singh Chhotepur-led Apna Punjab Party, the Left comprising CPI and CPI-M, and SAD-Amritsar.

Over 200 companies of paramilitary forces have been deputed for the fair conduct of polls.

Voting for Amritsar Lok Sabha seat by-poll is also being held amid tight security arrangements.

The total number of electors in the state is 1,98,79,069, including 93,75,546 females. There are 415 transgender voters.

The total number of candidates in the fray include 81 women and a transgender. The polling commenced at 22,615 polling stations in the entire state.

While 84 Assembly seats are of general category, 34 are reserved.

Speaking to reporters after casting his vote at Lambi, 89-year-old five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said, ""I have 70 years of experience and have fought for Punjab and India. This is a small battle.""

His comment came when asked about the electoral battle turning into a triangular contest this time with the entry of Aam Aadmi Party.

""We will have a bigger win than last time. AAP will finish at third spot,"" Sukhbir Badal claimed. ""People will vote for development, peace and communal harmony. AAP is a pack of criminals,"" he added.

Punjab Congress president and party's chief ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh said his party was leading in the state and was set to form the government. The senior Congress leader, who is contesting from Lambi, said he would defeat Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal in the latter's turf.

""This time three major parties are in the fray. I wish that whoever wins keep Punjab's interests above all,"" cricketer Harbhajan Singh told reporters in his hometown Jalandhar. He also appealed that more and more youth should come out to cast their votes.

General JJ Singh (retd) said SAD-BJP will perform a hat-trick and form the government.

Navjot Singh Sidhu, who along with his wife Navjot Kaur cast his vote, said, ""People of Punjab will give a gift to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi by ensuring party's victory here and its revival in the country.""

""Truth will prevail in Punjab...from this place Congress flag will start floating,"" he said.

The key contestants in the crucial state polls include Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh (Patiala and Lambi seats), Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal (Lambi) and his son Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal (Jalalabad).

The other prominent candidates are Congress veteran and former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal (Lehragagga), Indian Youth Congress chief Raja Amarinder Singh Warring (Gidderbaha), Badal's estranged nephew Manpreet Singh Badal, who is fighting on a Congress ticket from Bathinda Urban, and AAP MP Bhagwant Mann (Jalalabad).

Amritsar Lok Sabha seat fell vacant following the resignation of Amarinder Singh to protest the Supreme Court verdict on Punjab's river waters. The voter strength in this seat is over 14 lakhs.

Prominent among the candidates in fray for the Lok Sabha seat are BJP leader Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, who is up against Congress' Gurjit Singh Aujla and Aam Aadmi Party's Upkar Singh Sandhu.

For the Amritsar Lok Sabha by-poll, 35 per cent polling has taken place so far, an election office spokesman said here.

The counting of votes for the state polls and Amritsar Lok Sabha by-poll will take place on March 11.

Meanwhile, in Moga, the police booked Independent candidate Manjit Singh Mann under the provisions of the Representation of the People's Act and relevant sections of IPC, for allegedly campaigning even after the deadline for the same had ended, Moga's Returning Officer said.

Two ailing women voters, Raj Rani (78) and Bimla Devi (80), came in an ambulance to exercise their right of vote in Phagwara. While one was taken on a stretcher, the other was taken on wheelchair to Booth No 158 near old Dana mandi in Phagwara.

Talking to reporters later, the women said they had arranged for ambulances themselves. They urged the Election Commission to make separate and priority arrangements for the ailing voters.

In Fazilka, state police personnel gave roses to first ten voters."
"Varun Gandhi Back On BJP List Of 40 Star Attractions In UP. At Number 39","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-back-on-bjp-list-of-40-star-attractions-in-up-at-number-39-1655361","Lucknow:                             Varun Gandhi, excluded from the BJP's list of ""star campaigners"" in Uttar Pradesh for the first two phases of the assembly elections, is back on the list for the third and fourth phases. So is former state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar whose comments last week about Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and later about Smriti Irani of his own party were slammed as ""sexist.""

Varun Gandhi is number 39 on the list of 40 that every party has to submit to the Election Commission for each phase of elections, and the inclusion is seen as a conciliatory move. Mr Gandhi, 36, does not enjoy a happy equation with BJP chief Amit Shah and has been sulking with the party leadership, which he believes has not backed him after allegations were made last year that he had been honey-trapped and blackmailed into leaking crucial information.

But, said sources, after a rough time with rebellion in the ranks over the BJP fielding a number of people it has recently poached from other parties and from the supporters of another rebellious lawmaker Yogi Adityanath, the party wants no more trouble.

Varun Gandhi is the BJP lawmaker from UP's Sultanpur, which votes only in the fifth phase of the seven-part UP elections, but has considerable influence in pockets of Western UP like Saharanpur and in Pilibhit, his mother's Lok Sabha constituency, which vote in the first two phases.

Mr Gandhi's supporters are bristling at the snub to their leader, at one time talked about as a potential chief ministerial candidate, and the BJP wants to avoid a sabotage attempt when campaigning is at a peak especially in the sensitive western UP which will vote in the first phase on February 11.

The new list of key campaigners is led, like the first, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Veteran leader and the BJP's member of Parliament from Kanpur Murli Manohar Joshi makes a comeback - his omission from the first list along with that of party patriarch LK Advani for the first time ever had raised eyebrows.

Kanpur votes in the third phase. Mr Advani does not feature in this list of star campaigners either."

"AAP Has Max Chance Of Winning Punjab: Prannoy Roy's Analysis","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-has-voted-who-won-prannoy-roys-forecast-today-1656070","New Delhi:                             Around 1.4 crore people in Punjab voted for their 117-member assembly today. Some 1,100 candidates had their fates sealed in the crucial election that saw a three-way contest between the ruling Akali Dal-BJP alliance, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, which debuted in the state polls this time. The 2017 Punjab elections saw several high-octane contests with incumbent Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal taking on his predecessor, Congress' Amarinder Singh, in the former's constituency of Lambi, and AAP lawmaker Bhagwant Mann challenging Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal for the latter's Jalalabad seat. Former BJP lawmaker Navjot Singh Sidhu also contested as a Congress candidate from Amritsar East. The Congress seeks to regain the state from the SAD-BJP alliance, which has ruled Punjab for nearly a decade, while the AAP - which won all of its four Lok Sabha seats in 2014 from the state - expects to make a smashing foray.

Join Dr Prannoy Roy, Dorab Sopariwala and Shekhar Gupta as they identify and analyse the issues and mood of the voters from Punjab.

Prannoy Roy: A fascinating election to cover, one of the best I have ever done. Could this be the end of polling here too after Brexit, and US?

What pollsters say about who Punjab has chosen
 

Prannoy Roy: So we went on a trip across the state. Now we are in one the 'predictor constituencies' Bassi Pathana which seem to always pick the winner. So here is our forecast after speaking to hundreds of people.

Our first forecast said Congress had best chance now we say AAP has 55-60% chance of winning. Our first estimates were based on studying opinion polls but now we have gone around the state and spoken to more people and based on these inputs this is what we conclude.
 
Shekhar Gupta: Nobody is shy to say they are voting for change.

Prannoy Roy: There is a lot of unhappiness a lot of issues fuelling discontent. Here are the reasons

Key issues influencing the vote in Punjab
 
Prannoy Roy: Where is the AAP is going to get its vote from? AAP takes a lot of the Akali foundation away. AAP is weaker in Hindu areas, strong in Sikh areas. It did very well in East Malwa region. Here's how the political parties map looks like.

From 2012 to 2014 - How Aam Aadmi Party has changed the equation in Punjab
 
Shekhar Gupta: This is a very impatient electorate. Another reason for Akali's collapse is that over the past 10 years it has transformed from a democratic party to a dynastic party. The incidents of desecration and the fact that the guilty weren't caught angered the public.

How different regions in the state have previously voted in Punjab's assembly elections this year
 
Dorab Sopariwala: For the first time, I saw signs of despair in Punjab. Many people are voting for AAP are saying, ""What do we have to lose?""

Shekhar Gupta: But this despair is not for destitution though. It's for jobs and other issues.

Shekhar Gupta: For many people, voting for AAP is a gamble. They are willing to take a risk

Prannoy Roy: Another important factor in Punjab is the Dalit vote because they form a large part of the population.

Why the Dalit vote in crucial
 
Prannoy Roy: That's why there are 54 swing seats - very few seats are safe.
 
Shekhar Gupta: There is resentment about one family's rule in Punjab.

Prannoy Roy: People seem to trust Kejriwal. A party without a leader has come so ahead

Shekhar Gupta: AAP has gone beyond the identity. People don't care who is the party chief or who will be the chief minister they are voting for issues.

Shekhar Gupta: This election is about a CRY - Change, Revolt and Youth

Prannoy Roy to Arvind Kejriwal: How many seats will you win?

Arvind Kejriwal: More than 100 seats.
 
Dorab Sopariwala: It isn't just a support for AAP. It's a frenzy.

Shekhar Gupta: AAP seems to have co-opted patriotism. They don't have their own iconography so they have invoked people like Bhagat Singh, Rajguru.

Shekhar Gupta: I have not seen a Hindu leader get this kind of adulation in Punjab even counting Indira Gandhi in pre - Bhindranwale days

Prannoy Roy: So how does age divide, and the urban-rural divide affect the vote?
 
Prannoy Roy: People are saying there is a huge wave for the AAP in the pind or the villages but in cities there is still respect for the Congress.

Amarinder Singh to NDTV: AAP is not a problem for us. They were a problem two years ago when they were new, but their magic seems to have worn off as people have seen their functioning in Delhi. Sonia Gandhi is not Sikh but she made a Sikh party president here. AAP could have done that.
 
AAP's support comes not from Sikhs but from youth. Youth is frustrated, they want change, a new alternative. If I don't win, this is my last election. I have said that before. I am 75.

Sukhbir Singh Badal to NDTV: This a true story about us. We are not like Kejriwal who says something and does something else. Why I say Kejriwal is a useless and dangerous character because we have been through very bad terrorism. The people who are responsible are the people he is meeting. He is meeting people of Babbar Khalsa.  International people have breakfast with them because he wants to be a Chief Minister, so that he can get after PM Modi. His mission is only Modi.

He just wants to attack Mr Modi and wants that if I do that I will become a national figure.
 
(If AAP wins) It will be the worst thing in the history of Punjab because all criminal elements, all forces which are responsible to bring them to power will go back with them.

Captain Amarinder Singh will be number 3 in that (Lambi) constituency. Parkash Singh Badal will win with a majority of more 35,000 votes. Captain will be number 3.

Punjab recorded 70 per cent voter turnout today, here's how different age groups have voted in past
 
Prannoy Roy: Going by the trends, there seems to be a victory for AAP. The question is will it be a landslide."

"Uttarakhand Elections 2017: The Strategy Behind Harish Rawat Filing Nomination From 2 Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-chief-minister-harish-rawat-files-nomination-from-haridwar-rural-signalling-the-start-of-1653473","Haridwar:                             For Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, the last day of nominations brought with it a historic 'first'. After filing his nomination from Kichcha on Tuesday, the Chief Minister on Friday filed his nomination from Haridwar Rural, one of the 11 assembly seats in Haridwar district, where he won the Lok Sabha polls in 2009.

With this, Mr Rawat becomes the first state chief minister to be fielded from two assembly constituencies in Uttarakhand, something he claims, is a strategic imperative.

""These two districts (Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar) are the pillars of our states' development. Out of 70 seats, 20 seats are in these two districts so it is a sizeable share"", the chief minister told NDTV.

The last one week has seen the chief minister travel over 400 kilometres across Uttarakhand where he has been leading the Uttarakhand Swabhimaan Yatra to reclaim the spirit of the state dogged by the political instability of the past two years.

""For the last two and a half years I have had a terrible time. I have had to compromise on many counts,"" said Mr Rawat, who was made chief minister in 2014 after the untimely expulsion of Vijay Bahuguna, his predecessor, over the mishandling of relief operations in the aftermath of the 2013 Kedarnath disaster.

Mr Bahuguna, along with senior leaders like Harak Singh Rawat, Subodh Uniyal and Yashpal Arya, to name a few, form part of a group of leaders that has since defected to the BJP leaving the ruling Congress in disarray. But Mr Rawat doesn't think so.

""After these defectors I feel at least I will be able to perform to my fullest now,"" said Mr Rawat.

Vote-shares and seat distribution are major concerns for the Congress party that currently has only two elected members from the 20 seats in Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar. A large number of these seats were earlier held by the 'turncoat' leaders, 10 of whom have been fielded by the opposition BJP in the forthcoming elections.

Asked if he felt a threat from his own former colleagues, now rivals, Mr Rawat said, ""It is the primary duty of a CM to maintain a majority in the secretariat and I have lived up to that. People often wonder what is Harish Rawat's formula. But if the people of the state feel I should deliver, they should give me a clear mandate. This election is as much about prestige as it is about leadership"", said the 69-year-old chief minister.

According to Mr Rawat, the price of the political instability in the state in former months has been paid by the development process. ""Modiji came to Dehradun. But it seems like he finds it hard to admit our concerns in Delhi. Our proposal to develop an SEZ in the Bhagirathi valley has been stalled by the centre,"" he said.

In the same breath, the chief minister adds, ""I respect and admire Narendra Modi; I am only a small chief minister of a small state. Modiji talks about cooperative federalism, I would like to tell him that we are also part of that team.""

So what is Harish Rawat's immediate vision for the state? ""If elected, I promise a government that is 'bhrashtachar mukt aur rozgar yukt' (corruption free and employment generating),"" he says.

""The Congress has decided to include in its manifesto that by 2020, a job will be given to one member of every family. By 2020 we will also ensure that one woman of every household is linked to a bank in terms of employment. We want to create a model of human development which will make our little hill-state an ideal model,"" Mr Rawat adds.

""People should vote keeping in mind their future but also the challenges we have had to face in the past. There were so many attempts to derail us. Some would even call them sabotage. We have weathered the storms,"" he says.

Uttarakhand goes to polls on February 15 in a contest where both the ruling Congress and the BJP will contest for 70 seats. The test will be crucial for the Congress, which has been in power since 2012 but has yet produced only one chief minister who has lasted a full five year term. The last and only chief minister to have lasted a full five year term was ND Tiwari, a Congress chief minister with a term from 2002 to 2007."

""According to the party high command, Congress will contest all the 10 seats in Amethi and Raebareli,"" said Congress leader Sanjay Singh, who heads the campaign committee of the party.

Fielding of candidates in Amethi and Raebareli was one of the issues of contention between Congress and Samajwadi Party during their talks to forge the pre-poll alliance.

Mr Singh claimed that Samajwadi Party had assured Congress that it (Congress) will contest on all the 10 seats in these Lok Sabha constituencies of the Congress vice president and the party president, respectively.

""Congress will contest on all the seats and the party is firm on this resolve,"" he stressed.

To a question on BJP fielding his estranged first wife Garima Singh from Amethi, Mr Singh said the party has ""ignored its committed workers and given ticket to a candidate who is neither recognised nor has had any relation with the people of Amethi"".

He went on to add that ""Amethi has only one 'Rani' (queen) who is Amita Singh (his present wife) and had long been preparing ground for contesting from Amethi Assembly seat"".

As per its alliance pact with Samajwadi Party, the Congress will contest 105 out of 403 seats of the UP Assembly."
"Poll Commission Asks Candidates To Open Current Accounts As RBI Lifts Restrictions","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/poll-commission-asks-candidates-to-open-current-accounts-as-rbi-lifts-restrictions-1654262","New Delhi:                             The Election Commission has asked candidates in five states -- where assembly elections are being held -- to open current accounts so they won't have to face problems in withdrawing money for poll expenditure. Earlier, the Reserve Bank of India had refused to enhance the cash withdrawal limit for election candidates despite a request from the poll commission. But today, the central bank removed cash withdrawal limits from current accounts, cash credit accounts and overdraft accounts with immediate effect. The commission's advisory came immediately after.

Earlier, the Election Commission had instructed candidates to open a separate bank account for elections. A majority of candidates had opened current accounts.

Last week, the commission had written to the central bank, asking that the weekly cash withdrawal limit, which was Rs. 24,000, be increased to Rs. 2 lakh for candidates up for election in the five states. The bank had pointed out that though the government allows candidates to spend above Rs. 20 lakh, given the withdrawal limits, they would be able to spend less than Rs. 1 lakh before the elections begin.

The expenditure limits are capped at Rs. 28 lakh for Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and Rs. 20 lakh for Manipur and Goa.

The central bank, however, turned down the Commission, saying a special provision was not possible at the moment. The Commission had hit back, saying the RBI apparently ""has not realised the gravity of the situation"". ""It is reiterated that it is the constitutional mandate of the commission to conduct free and fair elections and to provide level playing field to all candidates,"" the Commission said, insisting that its directions be complied with.

Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur begin on February 4. The results will be announced on March 11."

Mr Rana, an accused in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and the party candidate from Thana Bhawan seat in neighbouring Shamli district, had made the remarks at a gathering in his constituency on Saturday, evoking criticism from opposition.

""If I emerge as the winner (in UP polls), curfew will be imposed in Kairana, Deoband and Moradabad,"" he said.

A case was registered against Mr Rana under IPC Section 505 (Making a statement with intent to incite) and Section 125 (Promoting enmity between classes in connection with election) of The Representation of the People Act for his controversial remarks, Thana Bhawan circle officer Sunil Kumar Tyagi said.

The officer said that it was found that the MLA's statement violated the model code of conduct for elections.

Mr Rana today claimed that his remarks were meant for people who have spread terror in the state.

""What I meant was many people have planned to leave western UP fearing the terror spread by goons and robbers. There is no city in that region where people have not planned to move out due to the fear of these goons,"" Mr Rana said.

""...when BJP forms government in UP, these goons who are part of the mafia, whose actions are feared and who forced residents to flee will have to leave the state. The residents of UP won't leave due to fear. The goons will have to leave the state,"" he added.

Hitting out at Mr Rana, SP leader Juhi Singh said, ""What does he want to do by imposing a curfew, he does not seem educated even to know when a curfew is imposed"".

BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi sought to distance from the MLA's remarks saying ""the party is not responsible if a candidate says something"".

""PM Modi and Amit Shah are saying that such statements should not be made. I don't know in what context he (Rana) has said it but I understand that our party is contesting the UP elections on the development plank,"" Ms Joshi said.

Mr Rana has also been booked for allegedly violating the model code of conduct after he held a public gathering and took out a road show at Hathi Karonda village in his constituency in Shamli district yesterday without the permission of the authorities, police said."

""We are not giving (Congress) a clean chit. We are choosing the lesser evil,"" Mr Khan said, referring to the Samajwadi Party's criticism of the Congress on various issues in the past. He also said that this is not a time to discuss such things, which could be answered after the elections.

""There was an experience in Bihar of a mahagathbandhan. That experiment in Bihar succeeded and there was a view among common people that there could be a coalition of like-minded people and they should come together and contest elections,"" the senior leader said to news agency Press Trust of India.

Mr Khan added that the Congress was a prominent force in the Indian independence movement and the Muslim community has had a long association with the party.

The Samajwadi Party leader further said that he does not know what compelled the Congress to form a coalition with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and the ""very agenda of BJP is against the weak, Dalits, backward and minorities"".

Mr Khan also criticised the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party and said that her party should give all 403 seats to Muslim candidates if they want to win over the community.(with inputs from PTI)"
"BJP Releases Manifesto For Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-bjp-releases-manifesto-for-uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-1653584","Lucknow:                             BJP President Amit Shah today released the party's manifesto for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections , which will be held in seven phases from February 11. While releasing the manifesto, called 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra' (Pledge for People's Welfare), the BJP president said the party will form the government in Uttar Pradesh with a two-thirds majority. He attacked the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party which have ruled Uttar Pradesh for the last 15 years, accusing them of doing nothing to develop it. The BJP, he said, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would turn UP into a developed state, the way it has other states it rules. The BJP is attempting to return to power in UP after 15 years. In 2012 it had won only 47 of the state's 403 seats, but in the national election of 2014 it swept 71 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats and hopes to extend that performance to this year's assembly election.

Here are the highlights of his speech:The country's biggest state is going to polls.BJP workers have organised public meetings in corners of the state.According to the feedback, BJP is going to form the government with 2/3rd majority.We have tried to understand what people want from the next UP government.We have taken the feedback of about 30 lakh people through missed calls, letters, etc.Prime Minister after his many rallies was sure that people will being BJP in power in UP.SP and BSP have formed governments for 15 years. In that time other states, more backward than UP, have developed.We were sent to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh etc and they are not BIMAARU states anymore.I don't have any qualms in saying that I want to thank the people of UP for giving us 72 of 80 seats. We wouldn't have made a majority govt at the Centre. But it is unfortunate that even with central govt, we can't do much for UP.PM is a parliamentarian from UP. All the schemes are ready but aren't being implemented in UP.Many mafia groups have made life difficult for UP.If a state differentiates on the basis of their vote banks, they can't get justice for all citizens.The election is going to take place after the notes ban. We have faith that the kind of war BJP and PM have launched on black money. UP will show us the results.We have not indulged in politics of caste and religion, we have done the politics of performance.The BJP, after many discussions, have divided the manifesto in 9 parts.The farmer in UP is suffering. The BJP has decided to waive off all farmer loans. The farmers will get further loans with 0 per cent interest.In the next 5 years, a 150 crore fund will be set up for agricultural development.Bundelkhand will get special preference.We will follow the motto of Na Goondaraj Na Bhrashtachar. In 45 days, we will bring all criminals, who are out on paroles and committing crimes, back to jails.FIRs for all citizens will be filed without caste bias.Land mafia has troubled the entire state. We have decided to set up a task force in every district to tackle different mafias.Class 4 and class 5 employees will be hired only on the basis of merit, interviews will be quashed.We will provide a 1,000 crore start-up capital fund.90 per cent of the jobs will be given to youth of UPLaptops distributed till now have been caste-based. We will give laptops without any bias with free 1 GB internet per month.We will allocate Rs. 500 crore for the Baba Ambedkar fund.All colleges and universities will have free Wi-Fi. All students scoring about 50 per cent will get free education till graduation.Up to 6 lakh loan from permanent houses and toilets. BPL citizens to get 2 lakh life cover.24x7 electricity in all houses. PM has said before 2019, all villages will have electricity. In the next five years, we will get toilets in every house, LPG in every house and pipelines for cities.Villages will be connected with mini-bus services.People will be able to use metro at any time with their families, unlike now.There will be a Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal fund for development.Redressal system in every district to sort our trader disputes.Rs. 5,000 for every girl child born in poor families; No age bar for widow pensions.We will take the opinion of all women on Triple Talaq and place it in front of Supreme Court.On Ram Temple, we will follow the law and get the temple build as soon as possible.I hope UP will be free of caste based politics and nepotism. UP's development is necessary for country's development. We have taken feedback from the people of UP.I hope UP's 20 crore people will give its blessings and BJP will form a majority government with 300 or more seats."

This comes a day after the Prime Minister campaigned in Punjab's Jalandhar alongwith the state's Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal.

Prime Minister Modi is expected to highlight the achievements of the BJP-led government in the state over five years and criticise the Congress and the AAP - which has fielded former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate.

""The Congress is in a real bad shape. They are being opportunistic,"" the Prime Minister said yesterday in Jalandhar.

""They can go to any extent for the power of the chair,"" he further said.

Earlier during the day, the Prime Minister also addressed NCC officers and cadets at a rally in New Delhi.

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, who is currently on a three-day visit to Punjab, is expected to rally in Goa on January 30.

Former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar was inducted by PM Modi into the Union Cabinet as Defence Minister in 2014. Following Mr Parrikar's induction, the BJP appointed Laxmikant Parsekar as chief minister. Earlier this month, Mr Parrikar said that Goa's chief minister should be ""young at heart"", even if slightly ""elder"".

Rumours of the Defence Minister making a return to state politics are strong after BJP president Amit Shah announced that the next government in Goa would function under the leadership of Mr Parrikar, should the BJP retain power in the state.  

The BJP has already announced 36 contestants for the 40-member legislative assembly in Goa. The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, which - until recently- was an alliance partner in the state, has decided to sever ties with the BJP.

Exuding confidence of a ""Congress sweep"" in the polls, Mr Singh negated any threat from either the AAP or the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), saying he did not see them securing ""more than 25 and 12 seats respectively"".

""The Congress would win the remaining seats hands down,"" he said, adding that the party would emerge victorious from all the four seats in Moga district, while the SAD would ""trail heavily"" even in their strongholds of Lambi and Jalalabad -- the seats of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal respectively.

Mr Singh alleged that Mr Sukhbir's own constituency of Jalalabad was in a ""big mess"" due to ""no development"" since the deputy chief minister had been ""busy all these years looting the state"".

He came down heavily on Parkash Singh Badal for the ""growing religious intolerance and incidents of sacrilege"" in Punjab, promising to put him behind bars after getting all the cases of desecration re-investigated.

Mr Singh promised to ""free"" the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) from the ""shackles of the Badals"", who had ""transformed it into their personal fiefdom for political exploitation"" and reiterated his support for anyone standing up against the Badals in the SGPC.

Addressing public rallies in support of Congress candidates Rajwinder Kaur Bhagike and Harchand Kaur from Nihal Singh Wala and Mehal Kalan constituencies respectively, Amarinder claimed that the AAP, ""with its Haryanvi leader and outsider base"", was not in a position to provide stable governance in Punjab, which he said could not afford to experiment with a new dispensation in the midst of the ""ongoing crisis"".

The former Punjab chief minister, gearing up for the last poll battle of his long political career, referred to reports of a large number of ""outsiders"" being brought in by the AAP for its roadshow in Patiala to caution the people against being taken in by Mr Kejriwal's ""false promises"".

Mr Singh vowed to throw behind bars Akali leaders such as Bikram Singh Majithia and Tota Singh, who had ""destroyed the lives of lakhs with their drug mafia and food scams"""

The central bank said the special provision was not possible at the moment, piquing the poll authority to give a curt response. ""It appears that the RBI has not realised the gravity of the situation... It is reiterated that it is the constitutional mandate of the commission to conduct free and fair elections and to provide level playing field to all candidates. In order to facilitate proper conduct of elections, it is imperative that directions issued by the commission are complied with,"" the poll authority said in a fresh letter to RBI chief Urjit Patel expressing ""serious concern"" over the bank's response.

The commission had on Wednesday requested the RBI to enhance the withdrawal limit for candidates from 24,000 to 2 lakhs rupees per week to help them meet their campaign expenditure. The weekly cash withdrawal limit set after the Nov 8 notes ban - which preceded a massive cash crunch across the country - has not been increased.

Assembly elections in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - begin from February 4. The poll panel wants the facility to be provided till results are announced on March 11.

The commission said the returning officer of the constituency would issue certificate of a person's candidacy which would allow him/her to withdraw the extra cash from bank accounts opened especially to meet poll expenses, which the commission said it monitors.

The poll panel has now asked the central bank to reconsider the request.

It reminded the central bank that as per law, candidates contesting assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab can spend Rs. 28 lakh each for electioneering. The limit in Goa and Manipur is Rs. 20 lakh each.

The poll panel argued that despite paying amounts through cheques, candidates still need hard cash for petty expenses, especially in rural areas where banking facilities are limited.

Again, during the construction of BJP office at Nityaipat Chithek I donated Rs. 14.79 lakhs. Now that they denied me ticket, I want my money back,"" Mr Singh was quoted as saying in Imphal.

Mr Singh has joined a little known East India Development Party (NEIDP). In 2007, he won the election as an independent candidate. In 2012, he contested on a Trinamoool Congress ticket but lost the election. The following year he switched over to BJP.

Mr Singh had earlier tried to storm the BJP party office with his supporter after he was denied ticket."
"BJP To Get 'Triple Talaq' In Uttar Pradesh After Rout In Delhi, Bihar: Sitaram Yechury","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-to-get-triple-talaq-in-uttar-pradesh-after-rout-in-delhi-bihar-sitaram-yechury-1653436","Lucknow:                             After its back-to-back debacles in Delhi and Bihar, BJP will face 'triple talaq' in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said today.

""BJP has been campaigning against 'triple talaq' and in the upcoming polls (in UP), it will face 'triple talaq' like situation after its debacle in Delhi and Bihar.

""The first talaq for the BJP and RSS was in Delhi Assembly elections followed by Bihar...now the third talaq will be in Uttar Pradesh,"" he told reporters here. The CPI(M) leader said the Left Front parties will contest for selected seats in Uttar Pradesh, where the Left movement has had its impact on the public to ""defeat communal parties and ensure that the voices of the deprived are raised in the assembly.""

""Our main aim is to prevent communal forces of BJP and its allies from coming to power and work with secular forces wherever the saffron party is strong,"" Mr Yechury said.

The Left leader said BJP desperately wanted to win the upcoming state polls, especially for 2019 Lok Sabha polls, for which ""new problems have been forced on the common man"", while comparing notebandi (demonetisation) with nasbandi (sterilisation).

Sitaram Yechury also blamed RSS and BJP for a series of attacks on Left cadres in Kerala.

""RSS and BJP are instigating violence in the name of Hindutva and to expand their base in north Kerala after they won an assembly seat in the state polls last year,"" he added."

Addressing a gathering of party workers at his official residence here, Mr Singh proposed Vikramaditya's name, who is the president of Himachal Youth Congress, as a probable candidate from Shimla (Rural) constituency for the next Assembly polls.

""I have received plenty of love from the people of the Shimla Rural, as much as I got from my own traditional home constituency,"" said Mr Singh, who had shifted to the constituency after his Rohroo constituency was reserved following delimitation in 2012.

""People should not think that I am abandoning Shimla Rural, instead I will continue to give equal attention to this constituency as well,"" he said.

The octogenarian leader and six-time chief minister has been active in electoral politics since 1962 and has been elected to Lok Sabha five times and state assembly eight times.

Himachal Pradesh will go to poll at the end of the year."

Nearly 15 people were injured in the blast in Maur Mandi town, which took place close to where Congress candidate Harminder Jassi was addressing a gathering. Maur Mandi is about 200 kilometres from state capital Chandigarh.

The injured, 10 of them in serious condition, were rushed to hospitals in Maur Mandi and Bathinda.

Mr Jassi, who is a relative of Dera Sacha Sauda sect chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, was whisked away by his security personnel following the blast.

Eyewitnesses said that the white Maruti 800 car, in which the blast took place, was parked at the spot for some time and no one removed it despite police making announcements to get it removed.

Some alleged that a few shots were also fired towards Mr Jassi's car.

The eyewitnesses said that a pressure cooker, filled with iron nails and other metallic things, was found lying near the car.

The car, in which the blast took place, was completely destroyed in the incident.

Police officials rushed to the spot and were investigating the incident. They did not rule out conspiracy behind the incident.

"Battleground Punjab With Prannoy Roy: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-battleground-punjab-with-prannoy-roy-1655069","The upcoming Punjab assembly election, scheduled for February 4, is expected to be an intense three-way battle between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance, the Congress and the debutante Aam Aadmi Party. The state will witness several high-octane contests wherein incumbent Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal will take on his predecessor, Congress' Amarinder Singh, in the former's constituency of Lambi, and AAP MP Bhagwant Mann will challenge Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal for the latter's Jalalabad seat. Former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu will also contest as a Congress candidate from Amritsar East. The Congress seeks to regain the state from the SAD-BJP alliance, which has ruled Punjab for nearly a decade, while the AAP - which won all of its four Lok Sabha seats in 2014 from the state - expects to make quite a debut.

Join Dr Prannoy Roy, Dorab Sopariwala, Shekhar Gupta and Amitoj Singh as they identify and analyse the issues and mood of the voters from the Golden Temple in Punjab.Here are the highlights from the show:

Prannoy Roy: Welcome to Battleground Punjab. You might be wondering why I am wearing a turban. It's because I am sardar at heart.The AAP got 24 per cent votes in 2014.
 
Prannoy Roy: There are four regions : East Malwa, West Malwa, Dwab and Majha. Hindus are in the northeast and Sikhs in the rest of the state. But it is not a communal state. It is a harmonious state.
 Shekhar Gupta: It is a very urbanised state.
 
Prannoy Roy: The Sikh vote leans for Akalis. For Hindus, it is exactly the other way round.
Amitoj Singh: I think the AAP floundered a bit. They realised they will need Sikh leadership if they want to fight elections in Punjab.
Prannoy Roy: Rural Sikhs vote quite a bit more for the Akalis than the urban Sikh.
 
Shekhar Gupta: East Malwa (where AAP has gained) has always been a rebellious region.
 
Dorab Sopariwala: The incumbent has got the support of the Dera Sacha Sauda.
Prannoy Roy: There is a huge urban rural divide.
 Amitoj Singh: You can see the age difference in the AAP and Akali rallies. AAP voters are young.
Shekhar Gupta: The most anti-Congress party in the country is the Akali Dal.
Prannoy Roy: The Congress vote goes up as Hindu population goes up. Where does the AAP get its vote from? 45 per cent from Akalis, 35 per cent from Congress and 20 per cent from others.Dorab Sopariwala: Poverty in Punjab is very different. Its mostly about the lack of jobs.

Shekhar Gupta: It's very credible how quickly AAP has been able to set up a party organisation and a cadre in Punjab.

Amitoj Singh: Drugs doesn't really come up in Akali campaigning. They just say some people are trying to give Punjab a bad name.

Shekhar Gupta: Congress hopes that Akalis can hold on to their base because those votes will go to AAP.
Prannoy Roy: Who will win Punjab? Congress 45 per cent, AAP 35 per cent, Akali+ 20 per cent.
 Dorab Sopariwala: There seems to be an anger in Punjab against the government that we haven't seen before.

Prannoy Roy: There is a 32 per cent Dalit vote here. Dalit Sikhs vote much more for Akalis. Hindu Dalits vote a little more for the Congress. It's great to see the election here is not about hatred. Religion plays a very small role in politics here.
 Amitoj Singh: The seat in Majitha is one to watch out for. AAP's candidate there may be their CM candidate. Sources say there is not a single constituency that AAP wants more than Majitha.
 Prannoy Roy: It is a fascinating election."

Three persons were killed yesterday in the explosion near the venue of the poll campaign of Congress candidate Harminder Singh Jassi at Maur Mandi.

""One more child has succumbed to injuries at CMC hospital in Ludhiana,"" Bathinda Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said today, adding, the victim has been identified as 13-year-old Saurabh Singla.

Earlier, Ripandeep, 9, and Japsimran, 14, died at the CMC hospital where they were admitted. Thirteen injured - three of them critical - are undergoing treatment at different hospitals.

Punjab DGP Suresh Arora along with other senior police officials today inspected the blast site. He said it was an ""unfortunate incident"".

Mr Arora said the Home Ministry has been requested to send experts of NSG to identify the material used in the explosion.

Asked whether the IED was used to carry out the blast, the DGP said one pressure cooker exploded in this incident while another was found at the spot. A forensic team has reached the site to probe the matter, he said.

On ""terror angle"", he said, ""Stating that this (terror) angle is not possible, it will be wrong to say at this moment. We are not ruling this possibility.""

Asked whether there was any input on the possibility of such a blast, the DGP said, ""In the context of Punjab, there is always suspicion that anything could happen. That is why strict security arrangements were done... And now this incident happened.""

Meanwhile, the Election Commission has sought a report from Punjab Police on the car explosion.

Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal condemned the blast and urged people to exercise calm and said those involved in it would be dealt with severely.

""Nobody would be allowed to disturb the hard-earned peace and communal harmony in the state,"" he had said earlier in the day.

AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal demanded immediate arrest of SAD chief and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal to ensure peaceful elections.

""To ensure peaceful elections, Sukhbir Badal should be immediately arrested. His role in yesterday's blast be probed. He'll cause more violence,"" Kejriwal tweeted.

Meanwhile, Congress Punjab chief Amarinder Singh blamed Mr Kejriwal for the explosion alleging that he had been promoting extremist forces like Khalistan Commando Force in the state."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Sidelined By Akhilesh Yadav, Uncle Shivpal Yadav Plans New Party","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sidelined-by-akhilesh-yadav-uncle-shivpal-yadav-says-will-form-new-party-1654535","Lucknow:                             Shivpal Yadav, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's estranged uncle, will contest the Uttar Pradesh elections as a candidate of the Samajwadi Party, but said he would reserve his campaigning for his supporters forced to contest as rebels and independents after being denied ticket by the party. Shivpal Yadav has also vowed to launch his own party after results for the UP assembly elections are announced on March 11.

The Chief Minister's uncle, isolated after Akhilesh Yadav took control of the party ahead of the crucial elections, was in Jaswant Nagar to file his nomination papers. While Akhilesh Yadav gave in to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav's request that Shivpal be fielded by the party, most of his supporters - many strong candidates, he said - have not been fielded.

""They were struck off the list of candidates to make me weak,"" Shivpal Yadav, 61, alleged in an attack on his nephew, who is now party president and is taking all the crucial decisions on the UP elections including sealing an alliance with the Congress.

Akhilesh Yadav's father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, has made it clear that he does not approve of the new partnership but his opinion is moot. Akhilesh Yadav has handed his father, who launched the Samajwadi Party 25 years ago, an advisory role as mentor.

For months before the elections, Shivpal Yadav needled and undermined the Chief Minister and was consistently backed by Mulayam SIngh, who is Shivpal Yadav's older brother.

""Netaji was attacked because he and I were speaking out against those who were doing wrong. I repeatedly requested Akhilesh not to insult Mulayam Singh but he didn't listen,"" a bitter Shivpal Yadav alleged today.

Shivpal Yadav said if the party had not fielded him, he would have contested as an independent candidate from the Jaswant Nagar constituency, which he represents."
"Union Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley's Budget Balm For Poor Skips Election Freebies","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-jaitley-budget-balm-for-poor-has-no-election-freebies-1655092","New Delhi: HighlightsBudget comes just just ahead of key elections in five states
It sought to ease pain of notes ban, gave tax breaks to the middle class
Also reached out to farmers, poor with special schemesFinance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Union Budget 2017 pledged to hike government spending on the rural poor and cut taxes on Wednesday, seeking to ease the pain of the notes ban in what he called it a ""budget for the poor"". He promised to double the income of farmers in the next five years and also to bring 10 million households out of poverty by 2019, seeking to reassure people that the slowdown of the economy caused by demonetisation would not spill over to the next year.

The Finance Minister promised more affordable housing for the poor, halved the basic rate of income tax to 5 per cent and cut taxes on small firms which make up 96 per cent of India's businesses, imposing an income-tax surcharge on those who earn more to offset the losses.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ban on 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, announced on November 8 with an aim to uproot corruption and black money, took out 86 per cent of the cash in circulation at the time. It resulted in a currency crunch that was seen to hit farmers, the rural poor and small traders the most.
 Arun Jaitley's Budget included special concessions for small businesses.Analysts said the Budget was in line with expectations that the government would target communities worst hit by the notes ban. But with elections beginning soon in five states, including in the crucial Uttar Pradesh, Mr Jaitley was expected to splurge on freebies which did not happen.  

The Budget was presented only three days before polling is held in Goa and Punjab, much to the chagrin of opposition parties who had alleged that the government advanced the Budget by a whole month only to be able to offer sops to voters. After it was presented, however, no major rival party called it an election budget, though they criticised it as presenting no vision.   

Congress leader and former union minister Anand Sharma said the budget ""misleading and directionless"" and alleged that the government had shifted it to avoid presenting the ""ill-effects of demonetisation.""

""I call this budget misleading because it is based on the data of just six months. The data from the third fiscal quarter, where the ill-effects of demonetisation will be visible, is not included in it...The budget, and all the rosy figures the Finance Minister is showing, is based on data prior to November 8, when demonetisation was announced. The estimates and projections are thus wrong,"" Mr Sharma said.

In his speech, Arun Jaitley defended demonetisation, saying it would increase revenues by forcing people to declare untaxed wealth, but conceded that it had hit the economy. On Tuesday the government lowered its growth forecast for the year ending in March 2017 to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.6 per cent in the previous year.

The ruling BJP says its recent gains in by-elections and civic polls are a signal that the people support PM Modi on the notes ban, despite the inconvenience that it has caused them. Opposition parties however allege that demonetisation has been a disaster, punishing the poor instead the corrupt, and have made it one of their main election agendas in the coming elections.  
 For the first time, the annual budget included expenditure on railways. (AFP)The battle for Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, is not only seen as a semi-final before national elections in 2019, but also offers parties the chance to win more Rajya Sabha seats, since most members of the upper house of Parliament are indirectly elected by state legislatures.

Samajwadi Party and Congress will form government in UP.Whether we will form an alliance in Lok Sabha or not is open to discussion.Priyanka (Gandhi) has been of tremendous help to me and so have I. Whether she campaigns or not, it's her choice. She is an asset to the Congress.I personally respect Mayawatiji. BSP made a government in UP and made some mistakes. But my respect for her is still intact.BJP makes one Indian fight against the other. Their ideology is dangerous for our country. But Mayawati's ideology is not of any danger to us. My point is - you can't compare BJP and BSP.This alliance isn't opportunistic. We will explain to Modiji, the BJP and the RSS that UP and its people are one. We will not let them create a divide.During negotiations there was posturing. He (Akhilesh) said something I said something, he pretended to be angry and so did I. it's a part of negotiations. Media should not take this too seriously.We have discussed the minimums of Congress that we believe in the politics of the poor. They should benefit from this.This is dil ka alliance hai, mil ke jeetenge (It is an alliance of heart, we will win together)The message to PM Modi through this alliance is that Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christians are one. We won't let Modi divide the nation.

"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: In BJP's Manifesto, Ram Temple And 'Exodus' In Western UP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-bjp-will-win-with-two-thirds-majority-says-amit-shah-1653616","Lucknow: HighlightsAmit Shah releases BJP's manifesto for Uttar Pradesh polls
Says will form inclusive government, no discrimination over caste
Promises Ram temple in Ayodhya, laptops with 1 GB internet for students
                                Promising inclusive development if the BJP is elected, the party's chief Amit Shah on Saturday launched its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections will be held in multiple phases from February 11. Mr Shah also said the BJP was committed to exploring all constitutional options to ensure that the Ram temple is constructed in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya - emphasising that this marks no shift in the party's stand.

But a Hindutva push, subdued for the last few elections as the BJP has pitched development, was seen in it. Mr Shah said there was no contradiction, stating, ""Temple and development can co-exist.""

Among the promises that Mr Shah highlighted was closing down slaughter houses and he said the BJP, if elected, would seek the opinion of the state's Muslim women and then approach the Supreme Court on the issue of the Islamic divorce triple talaq. He also brought up the alleged mass migration of Hindu families from riot-hit towns in western UP that have a Muslim majority, saying the BJP would form teams to ensure to check the exodus of people from their homes because of communal tension and would put the onus on senior government officials to ensure it does not happen.

In its manifesto, the BJP has unveiled a 'zero-poverty plan', promised to waive loans for small farmers, free education and scholarships for the poor and, in what Mr Shah said tops the offer of Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, free laptops with 1 GB free internet for the young.

The BJP's laptops would be given to all regardless of caste or religion unlike the Samajwadi Party's, said Mr Shah, accusing Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's party and also Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party of neglecting UP's development for the last 15 years that they have in turns ruled the state. The BJP, if given a chance to return to power, would bring to UP the kind of development it has to other states it rules, Mr Shah pledged.

""If a state differentiates on the basis of their vote banks, there can't be justice for all citizens. We promise a government that will not discriminate on the basis of caste or creed,"" Mr Shah said in Lucknow, adding, ""Once the BJP comes to power, we work for development of all citizens unlike the SP and the BSP.""

In the 2014 election the BJP had swept 71 of UP's 80 seats. Amit Shah said he had feedback that the BJP would win the state by a two-thirds majority in these assembly elections. He hopes for more than 300 seats, Mr Shah said, adding, ""We have taken the feedback of about 30 lakh people through missed calls, letters, etc. We have done 5,000 public meetings.""

The BSP's Mayawati hit back at the BJP almost immediately saying the BJP has no ""moral right"" to issue another manifesto, when it had ""failed to fulfil any promises made in 2014"".

She also attacked Amit Shah on his remarks on the Ram temple at Ayodhya saying, ""The BJP's national president should know that is it a new thing they are saying that they will construct the Ram Mandir when they come to power here. The matter is in the Supreme Court. Till there is a decision, they can say what they want, the people will never let them do anything wrong here. This is Uttar Pradesh, not Gujarat."""

"PM Narendra Modi's Speech In Panjim Ahead Of Goa Elections 2017: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-pm-narendra-modi-addresses-public-rally-in-goas-panjim-1653603","Panjim, Goa:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi is addressing a public meeting today in Panjim ahead of the Goa assembly elections, scheduled for February 4. This comes a day after the Prime Minister campaigned in Punjab's Jalandhar alongwith the state's Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. Prime Minister Modi is expected to highlight the achievements of the BJP-led government in the state over five years and criticise the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party - which has fielded former Inspector General of Prisons Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate. ""The Congress is in a real bad shape. They are being opportunistic,"" the Prime Minister said yesterday in Jalandhar. Earlier during the day, the Prime Minister also addressed NCC officers and cadets at a rally in New Delhi.

Following are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech:The last five years have been an era of development.On this foundation, we want to take the progress forward.In a survey of all small states, they found Goa was the shining star.Infrastructure, social schemes - the Goa government set an example for even the bigger states.I see from Delhi how much work has been done in Goa, I feel very happy about it.For years, Goa has suffered from a disease. This election is to rid Goa of that disease.What is that disease? It is the disease of instability.Political turmoil has hindered Goa's progress.There was a time in Goa's recent history when it saw a dozen chief ministers in 10 years.This slowed down Goa. This instability suited the Congress very well. They managed to shirk accountability.But then people of Goa decided to give five years to a single government. However, even then, for their own benefit they ran away.I appeal to people of Goa to give us a comfortable majority. If you do that I promise you, we will make Goa India's most comfortable state.Today, the Centre is stressing on tourism.People said tourism will dry up - notes ban will affect tourism.Today, they have been silenced.The old government did not understand that to bring tourists from abroad, you have to focus on the international audience. We did that.The government's efforts to encourage tourism benefits Goa the most.This is an industry which can give huge returns even with small investment. The poorest of the poor can earn from it.For 10 years, there was a government at the Centre which had no interest in building any bridges in Goa.This would adversely affect the state's economy. That's why we have focused on infrastructure in Goa.We are building a bridge which will be a convenience for the people and an attraction for the tourists.I can say proudly our government at the Centre has helped Goa more in 25 months than in the last 50 years.This is our speed; this is our direction.Some people don't progress and don't let others progress.  These people are the pickpockets of democracy. They show the country in a poor light.The government is going to release its budget on February 1.Some parties have already started calling economists and intellectuals. They are making drafts of messages to criticise us in Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab.They are working harder than the Finance Minister in their efforts to malign the budget.They are like those parents who blame teachers, schools for their children's poor performance in exams.Some parties have questioned why the Election Commission scheduled Goa and Punjab elections on the same date.This means they are prepping for losing. If you don't have faith in the umpire, why have you come to play?People are trying to drag politics to such levels and they feel proud of it.Tell me, aren't Indians smart? Why is the Congress being defeated across the country?Well, Goans are smarter than the rest of India.They have seen Congress's misrule and corruption. So they will not vote for the Congress.There can be political differences, ideological differences - this is normal in a democracy.But it pains me when political leaders run away from debates about development.Governments should be measured by the development they bring.Today the world, after many years, is watching a government which can take strong, decisive decisions.Tell me, isn't the whole world hailing India or not? In America? In Japan? In China? In Sri Lanka? In Nepal?What is the reason for this? Not because of Modi. This is happening because 125 crore Indians picked a government with complete majority after 30 years.Shouldn't Goa too have a stable government with a comfortable majority? Shouldn't Goa be hailed across India?That's why I appeal to you to give us a comfortable majority.There is a time constraint. I have to leave before the sun sets, I cannot break rules of the armed forces. The Defence Minister is sitting here.Goa has given such a strong Defence Minister. The world is still talking about surgical strikes.Once Indian soldiers decide something, they prove their valour.February 4 is voting day. Please vote in large numbers. Let Goa bloom like the lotus."

In a huge outreach to the Muslim community, which forms 18 per cent of the state, the BSP has given tickets to 97 Muslim candidates. She is also expected to answer questions regarding the induction of Mukhtar Ansari, who has been accused in over 40 cases of murder and kidnapping, into her party. The 56-year-old Ansari is currently in a jail in Lucknow.

Earlier today, BJP chief Amit Shah released the party's manifesto.

Here are the live updates of Mayawati's press conference:The BJP has no right to announce a political manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.PM Modi in 2014 had promised a lot in the Lok Sabha elections in UP.

The data analysis, released by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) on Tuesday, showed that 97 per cent of candidates of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are multi-millionaires, followed by the Congress at 92 per cent and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) with 52 per cent.

Ranjit Cotta Carvalho (AAP) leads the pack with the highest declared assets of over Rs. 65 crore, Michael Vincent Lobo (BJP) with over Rs. 54 crore and Pratapsingh R. Rane (Congress) with over Rs. 50 crore.

The percentage of candidates with pending criminal cases is quite low. Only 38 out of the 251 candidates (15 per cent) have declared criminal cases against them. A total of 19 candidates (8 per cent) have serious criminal charges against them.

Party-wise, most candidates with criminal cases are from the Congress (9 of 37, or 24 per cent), followed by the BJP (17 per cent) and the AAP (8 per cent).

As for candidates with serious criminal charges against them, the Congress again tops the list with 16 per cent, while for the BJP it is 8 per cent. No AAP candidate has serious criminal charges against him or her.

Polling for the 40-seat Goa assembly is slated for February 4. The counting will take place on March 11."

'Accept money from any party but vote for BJP', said the minister
Delhi Chief Minister also triggered a row after making similar statement
                                Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has been asked by the Election Commission to explain by Friday his controversial remarks during campaigning for the upcoming elections in Goa in which he appeared to tell people that they could accept money from any political party but should vote for the BJP.

On Sunday, the minister had told a small crowd at Chimbel near Panaji: ""...I understand if someone organises a rally and you take Rs. 500 for moving around with (the candidate), that is not a problem. But when you vote, choose the lotus (BJP's poll symbol). This you must remember.""

The Election Commission had ordered the police to file a First Information Report or FIR against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party, after he stoked row with a similar statement.

At a rally in Goa's Benaulim earlier this month, Mr Kejriwal had said: ""If Congress or BJP candidates offer money, do not refuse it. Accept it as your own money. But when it comes to voting, press the button against the name of the AAP candidate.""

But in an apparent correction on Monday, Mr Parrikar said, ""I want to say this to you: please do not fall for any greed. Voting is a pure deed... The government is for the next generation. So, while electing a government, you have to decide what the coming government will give us.""

Regional party Goa Forward however registered a complaint with the Election Commission, saying that if action is being taken against Mr Kejriwal for similar comments, the Defence Minister should not be spared.

In several tweets, the Delhi Chief Minister also dared the Election Commission to take action against Mr Parrikar. On Tuesday, he also posted a video of the minister's comments.

""Will EC dare take action against Manohar Parrikar?"" Mr Kejriwal said in tweets, adding, ""I urge PMO to allow EC to act against Parrikar.""

The Congress also demanded action against Mr Parrikar.

Goa will vote on February 4 for a new 40-seat assembly."

Over 20 candidates, including Akali Dal leader and finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa, former Punjab chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and Congress youth leader Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, reached Sirsa to meet the sect chief.

Notably, the Election Commission strictly prohibits the use of temples, mosques, churches, gurudwaras or any place of worship for election propaganda, including speeches, posters, music etc, on electioneering.

 However, many of those who met the Dera chief, tried to downplay their meeting, saying there was nothing political about their visit.

After meeting Mr Singh, Mr Dhindsa told reporters that it was not the question of Dera support or otherwise. He asserted that there was ""nothing political"" about his visit.

Some others said they do visit the Dera once in a while and the timing should not be linked with the Punjab elections.

Mr Bhattal said the Dera, like Congress, supports causes like drug de-addiction and sends out a message to wean away the youths from the drug menace.

The Dera has a number of followers in many areas of Punjab, especially in the Malwa region which accounts for bulk of the assembly seats in the 117-member Punjab Assembly.

Ram Singh, chairperson of the Dera's political wing, told reporters that no decision had been taken so far, when asked if the political wing had decided to extend support to any particular political outfit."

The BJP had expelled Dayashankar Singh, who was once deputy chief of the party's UP unit, for allegedly using derogatory words against BSP chief Mayawati.

Swati Singh, a teacher by profession, was appointed the state president of the BJP's women wing in October last year. She had come to prominence after she launched a campaign against BSP leaders who had raised slogans against her minor daughter following her husband's use of derogatory words for Ms Mayawati.

BJP state media incharge Harish Chandra Srivastava informed that Ms Singh;s candidacy was announced after being approved by party national president Amit Shah.

In July 2016, the BJP expelled then Dayashankar Singh from the party over his use of derogatory words directed toward former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Ms Mayawati, which created a national controversy. The opposition parties stood united and unanimously condemned Mr Singh.  A police case was also filed by BSP leaders.

Senior BJP lawmaker and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley issued a statement in the Parliament, ""It is not right and I condemn the use of this word. If a person has said this, we will investigate.

""I express personal regret. I associate with your dignity and stand with you,"" he said, addressing Ms Mayawati.

Mr Singh, eventually, issued an apology and said, ""She (Mayawati) has come up after a lot of struggle.""

""The opposition parties are working overtime, more than the efforts put in by Finance Minister to prepare the Budget, to criticise the advancement of budget date. It is an indication that these parties have accepted defeat in the forthcoming polls,"" he said, addressing an election rally in Goa's capital Panaji.

""Though the union budget is going to be presented on February 1, some political parties are already making graphs to criticise the government, without even having an idea of the budgetary provisions,"" PM Modi said.

The PM appealed to the voters of Goa to give a comfortable majority to the BJP in the election for ""growth"" and stability of the state, which had suffered due to instability in the past.

Goa is going to polls on February 4.

PM Modi also made a reference to the objection raised for holding elections in Punjab and Goa on the same day.

""A political party (referring to AAP) even went ahead and alleged that PMO pressurised the Election Commission for holding elections on the same day for these two states. The system has to be respected and strengthened. But some people take pride in devaluing it,"" said the Prime Minister.

While appealing to the voters to give comfortable majority to BJP, PM Modi said, ""My government in New Delhi has given more to Goa in last 25 months than what the state received from the Centre in last 50 years. There have been some facilities provided such as visa on arrival and Goa is major beneficiary of such facilities.""

""With minimum investment, tourism sector can prosper. Tourism also helps a cross-section of the society by creation of jobs. My government will work with the state government -- shoulder to shoulder for the betterment of Goa,"" he said. PM Modi said BJP will create the best infrastructure in Goa for the tourists as well as locals

Blaming the previous UPA government at the centre, he said ""In the 10-year rule (of UPA government) there were no funds for Goa for construction of even a bridge.""

""More than development of the state, some political parties get pleasure in hurting others,"" he said.

""People of the country are wise; hence Congress is being defeated everywhere. People of Goa are wiser; hence they should vote for BJP and give a comfortable mandate,"" he said.

This comes amidst the strong speculation that Mr Parrikar could make a return to state politics if the BJP retains its control in Goa.

""The chief minister, whoever he is, has to be young at heart,"" Mr Parrikar said, replying to a voter's question at a BJP youth convention in Panaji.

""Though there is a requirement of youth to be the chief minister, I feel that the chief minister can be a slightly elder person who can understand the aspirations of the youth,"" he added.

The Union Minister also said that political stability is a compulsion for the development of a state like Goa.

""I remember, in 1989, I never thought I was destined to be in politics. In those 10 years, I saw at least 12 chief ministers.. If you want to have a comprehensive development of Goa, the plan needs to be worked out. But during that time, there was no plan,"" Mr Parrikar said.

 At a rally yesterday, BJP president Amit Shah had announced that should the party retain power in Goa, the next government would function under Mr Parrikar's leadership - which fuelled strong rumours of the Defence Minister's return to the coastal state.

Even Union Minister Nitin Gadkari hinted that the chief minister could either be someone from the legislators, or could be sent to the state from the Centre.

Manohar Parrikar, then Chief Minister of Goa, was inducted into the Union government as Defence Minister in 2014. He was succeeded by Laxmikant Parsekar as Goa Chief Minister.

Legislators Nemcha Kipgen and Vungzagin Valte submitted their resignation letters to party President TN Haokip as well as to Speaker Th Lokeshwor, they said. With the resignation, the strength of Congress has gone down to 45 seats in the 60-member House.

Kipgen had been elected in the last assembly polls from Kangpokpi constituency which had recently been upgraded into Kangpokpi district.

Valte was elected from Thanlon assembly constituency. Vice-president of Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) S Achouba also resigned from the primary membership of the party.

Incidentally, the state's move to carve out seven new districts has triggered protests by Manipur's apex Naga organisation United Naga Council (UNC).

Last year, three veteran Congress heavyweights N Biren, Y Erabot and Francis Ngajokpa had resigned and joined the BJP.

Elections for the 60-member Manipur Assembly will be held in two phases, on March 4 and March 8.

BJP, which is in direct fight with the Congress in the state, is unlikely to project any chief ministerial candidate.

Many Congress leaders have resigned from the party and joined the BJP ahead of the polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Punjab including stalwarts like Vijay Bahuguna and Rita Bahuguna Joshi among others."

JD(U) national General Secretary KC Tyagi told reporters in Patna that the decision to pull out of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections was taken at the party's core committee meeting yesterday.

""The decision has been taken to defeat the communal forces and also to ensure no further division in secular votes takes place,"" Mr Tyagi said. He also expressed disappointment that a comprehensive alliance on the lines of grand-alliance in Bihar, where all ""secular forces"" joined hands to defeat the BJP, could not be formed. Samajwadi Party and Congress have, however, formed a pre-poll alliance in UP.

""We are disappointed, surprised and hurt that both SP and Congress failed to form a grand alliance on the lines of Bihar that proved to be a milestone in nation's politics. Bihar's grand alliance was formed by the efforts of both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad who buried their differences for a bigger objective,"" Mr Tyagi said.

""If we have to win the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then it is necessary that BJP must be defeated in UP polls,"" he said.

Mr Tyagi also said, that had Ajit Singh's party Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and JD(U) been accommodated in the grand alliance, it would have won 300 seats in the UP assembly.

He was accompanied by Water Resources Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, party National General Secretaries RCP Singh, Shyam Rajak, Sanjay Jha and others.

Asked if Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is also JD(U)'s national president, would go to Uttar Pradesh if invited by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for campaigning, Ranjan Singh said ""he (Nitish Kumar) would not go to UP for campaigning"".

""We don't have much stake in UP, so we will pray from here (sitting in Patna) for them to win,"" Mr Singh said.

Mr Tyagi further expressed his disappointment that hard work put in by party workers in preparing grounds for UP assembly polls in five divisions where Nitish Kumar addressed some public meetings could not fructify."

Incumbent legislators Nemcha Kipgen and Vungzagin Valte tendered their resignation letters to state party chief TN Haokip as well as assembly Speaker Th Lokeshwor. With their resignations, the strength of the Congress in the assembly has reduced to 45.

The vice president of the Congress' Manipur unit S Achouba also resigned from primary membership of the party.

Last year, three senior legislators - N Biren Singh, Y Erabot Singh and Francis Ngajokpa - had quit the Congress and joined the BJP. Sources said that Mr Kipgen, Mr Valte and Mr Achouba might also join the BJP.

The BJP has claimed that several senior ministers would also quit the Congress ahead of the polls.

Mr Kipgen had been elected from the Kangpokpi assembly seat in the last elections whereas Mr Valte was elected from the Thanlon constituency.The Congress has been ruling in the state of Manipur for the last 15 years.

Manipur is facing a crisis after the United Naga Council called for an economic blockade on November 1 to protest against the state government's decision to bifurcate Naga dominated areas and create seven new districts. The economic blockade has affected the key road links to the state, including National Highway-2 and National Highway-37, which in turn has created an acute shortage of essential goods and supplies."

Mr Mann to contest from Jalalabad seat against Akali Dal's Sukhbir Badal
                                Bhagwant Mann for Punjab Chief Minister? The Aam Aadmi Party lawmaker who made headlines and earned the wrath of his colleagues last year by live-streaming his arrival at parliament, is drawing massive crowds while campaigning across the state and his party's leaders are reportedly weighing projecting him for the state's top job.

AAP's Manish Sisodia recently said only someone from Punjab will be Chief Minister if the party wins the assembly elections, a disclaimer prompted by speculation that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal could shift to that state. Delhi lawmaker and Lambi candidate Jarnail Singh told NDTV that AAP's Chief Minister will be a ""turban-wearing Sikh.""

Bhagwant Mann, 44, a former comic and very popular in Punjab, fits the bill. In a measure of his party's faith in him, he is also taking on Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal of the Akali Dal for the Jalalabad assembly seat, in what is pegged as the biggest battle in Punjab.  

On the campaign trail Mr Mann is now definitely keen to project that he is ready for a larger role. He refuses to crack jokes on cue or perform the limericks which made him a hit with the media.

When asked by this reporter whether he could be projected by the party as presumptive Chief Minister, Mr Mann did not reject the possibility. ""I never said I will be Chief Minister but the public is there. They are saying..what they want. Our leadership has said they will decide later. Let us wait.""

""Nothing has been decided yet,"" a senior AAP leader said in Delhi, but admitted, ""there is amazing craze for Mann among voters.""

What may be holding the AAP leadership back from announcing Bhagwant Mann as its Chief Ministerial candidate is the negative impact of his parliament live stream. He was suspended for a day and faced ferocious attacks from rival parties like the Akali Dal and Congress for exposing parliament to a security threat. His party, however, stood by him through the entire episode.

Bhagwant Mann's Sangrur parliamentary seat was one of four that Arvind Kejriwal's party won in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The party had won all its Lok Sabha seats from Punjab and now hopes to replicate there, its sweep of Delhi in 2015."

""The reports doing rounds of my joining BJP are nothing but rumours and only show the fear of BJP which is spreading them... this is an attempt to malign my image and I will go to court against it,"" Mr Agarwal, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP, told the media in Lucknow.

""BJP knows that when they will come out to campaign they will not get the votes of traders and so are resorting to such rumours,"" he alleged.

Answering a question, Mr Agarwal said he had recently met Home Minister Rajnath Singh in connection with some work of his constituency but it does not mean that he was joining the BJP.

He was reacting to media reports that he might soon join the BJP soon.

Mr Agarwal said he was with Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav.

To a question on chances of party lawmaker Beni Prasad Verma's son joining the BJP after he was denied a Samajwadi Party ticket from the constituency of his choice, Mr Agarwal said ""Beni should resign from his membership of the Upper House that would be more courageous of him... harming the party from inside will only harm him"".

On the issue of casinos, he claimed, ""The BJP government assured to remove these casinos; that is why people voted for them. The party that made this promise has reneged on the promise and that is for all to see.""

""No matter what money comes to the state, ultimately the image of the state is more important. For AAP, Goa cannot be categorised as the gambling or drug destination,"" he added.

Earlier, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had termed the upcoming Goa polls - scheduled for February 4 - as a ""dharma-yuddha"". He also claimed that the state government is harassing Elvis Gomes by levelling false charges of corruption against the former bureaucrat.

"Punjab Elections 2017: Congress Is Yesterday's News, Says PM Narendra Modi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-elections-2017-congress-is-yesterdays-story-says-pm-narendra-modi-1653340","Jalandhar: HighlightsPM in Punjab to campaign for assembly elections
Asks people to bring back BJP-Akali alliance led by Chief Minister Badal
Says Congress desperate for power, like a fish out of water
                                The Congress is yesterday's news and now collapsing across the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Punjab today, advising the state to stick with the time-tested Parkash Singh Badal, once the youngest chief minister and now the oldest. Punjab votes for a new government next week and PM Modi asked the state to return the Akali Dal-BJP for an unprecedented third straight term.

""You all can see how the Congress is collapsing across the country...They are desperate for power, their desperation is like that of a fish out of water,"" PM Modi said at a rally in Punjab's Jalandhar, a few hours after the Congress' Rahul Gandhi launched a big attack on the Badals at Majitha, about 80 km away.
 PM Narendra Modi asked people to bring the Badal family back to power in the Punjab elections 2017.So badly off is the Congress, PM Modi said, that it ""can go to any extent for the power of the chair,"" pointing to the rival party's election tie-ups in states like Bengal, Bihar and now Uttar Pradesh, where it is ready to play junior partner to regional heavyweights.

PM Modi credited Chief Minister Badal with working ""night and day for the unity of Hindus and Sikhs"" and said that in their many meetings all that the 89-year-old chief minister has discussed with him is the welfare of Punjab's farmers and its poor.

""Badal Sahab has always been true to Punjab, he has always given his best and Punjab would love to see him lead it towards development and a better future,"" the Prime Minister said, accusing rival parties of ""going to any extent in their selfishness and greed for power to ruin Punjab's image"" and asking the state to ""punish them all for speaking about this great land in bad light"".
 Rahul Gandhi attacked the Badal family in his speech today ahead of Punjab elections 2017.In his speech at Majitha, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Badal family has ""taken away everything from Punjab"" accusing them of forcing the people of the state to pay a ""Badal tax."" Mr Gandhi is on a three-day tour of Punjab that will see him travel to all the seats that the immediate and extended family of the chief minister is contesting. He began his visit in Majitha, the constituency of powerful Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia, the brother in law of Sukhbir Badal, who is deputy chief minister and the Chief Minister's son. He will also campaign in Mr Badal senior's Lambi constituency and his son's Jalalabad constituency.

The PM mocked the Congress' efforts saying the party was so sure it was winning the 2012 election that it had begun practicing taking oath. But for the first time ever Punjab had re-elected a government, voting the Akali-Dal BJP back in power. It would happen again this time, PM Modi said."
"In UP Elections, The Rani Of All Battles In Rahul Gandhi's Amethi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-up-elections-the-rani-of-all-battles-in-rahul-gandhis-amethi-1652096","Amethi: HighlightsSecond wife of Congress' Sanjay Sinh says she'll fight as rebel candidate
Ameeta Sinh wanted to contest from Amethi seat as Congress-SP candidate
BJP picked Garima Sinh, estranged first wife of Sanjay Sinh, for Amethi
                                If the BJP had planned a royal vs royal battle for the Amethi assembly seat in Uttar Pradesh, it could well get that even after the Samajwadi Party announced that its Gayatri Prajapati would contest the seat and not a Congress candidate. The Congress' Ameeta Sinh, who hoped to be fielded, has said she will contest as a rebel candidate. The BJP has picked Garima Sinh, 60, the estranged first wife of Congress leader Sanjay Sinh, locally known as the Maharaja of Amethi, which is also Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituency.

Sanjay Sinh's second wife Ameeta Sinh, 54, wanted to contest the Amethi assembly seat as the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance's official candidate. But in his half-half division of the 10 seats in Amethi and adjacent Raebareli, Gandhi turf, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav chose to retain Amethi for his Samajwadi Party to contest. Sitting legislator and minister Gayatri Prajapati is the alliance's candidate.

""Amethi is my family and my home and I cannot leave it... I will contest from here,"" said Ameeta Sinh, a three-time MLA and former state minister who claims she has worked hard in the constituency and is a strong candidate. Ms Sinh said she was talking to senior Congress leaders.  

She accused the BJP of ""petty politics"" for picking Garima Sinh, a political novice, to contest in Amethi. ""They have given ticket to someone who has no recognition in the region... people here have neither seen her nor has she seen them for years,"" Ameeta Sinh alleged.

The BJP is betting on Garima Sinh coming out on top as palace intrigue plays out politically - in Amethi, both are called Rani or Queen.

Garima Sinh, who calls Sanjay Sinh's marriage to Ameeta illegal, had in 2014 moved into a portion of the Bhupati Bhawan Palace in Amethi that Sanjay and Ameeta live in, along with her son and three daughters, laying claim to the considerable family fortune. She is the niece of former Prime Minister VP Singh and is said to have a fair amount of support among locals despite having been away from Amethi for many years.

Ameeta Sinh was earlier married to national badminton champ Syed Modi who was shot dead in 1988. Sanjay Sinh and Ameeta were charged with murder but were later acquitted by courts.

The battle of the Ranis may draw attention, but Samajwadi Party's Gayatri Prajapati, a backward caste leader, is still seen to have the edge in Amethi. He had defeated Ameeta Singh in 2012 by almost 10,000 votes. The BJP's candidate had polled less than 10,000 votes.

Amethi will vote on February 27, in phase five of the seven-phase UP election.  Results will be announced on March 11."
"Punjab Elections 2017: Meet Nirvaan Singh, The Man Behind Captain Amarinder Singh's New Twitter Skills","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-elections-2017-meet-nirvaan-singh-the-man-behind-captain-amarinder-singhs-new-twitter-skills-1653156","Macchiwara, Punjab:                             Nirvaan Singh, an unassuming young man of 27, goes everywhere that Captain Amarinder Singh does on his campaign trail, between rallies engaging the 75-year-old Congressman on his smartphone as he explains social media tools, prepares him for a Facebook Live or just asks him to respond to a query.

Nirvaan Singh is Captain's grandson and runs his social media campaign. He has his task cut out as his grandfather, an old-style politician, takes on the likes of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, famous for its use of social media for election campaigns.

He says Captain's eagerness to learn new skills for canvassing is an advantage and he provides the bridge between the Congress' state chief and the election strategist Prashan Kishore and his team of number-crunching professionals deployed by the party for next week's assembly elections.

""Before putting anything out on social media, we discuss it with Prashant Kishore and his team and the rest he does,"" Nirvan said, referring to his grandfather. Unlike the last election where the social media teams needed laptops, now it's all on smartphones and Nirvaan only needs his iPhone 7.

""I think it's great,"" said Amarinder Singh to NDTV. ""I look at what people are saying till about 1 am, so it is great fun."" Captain, who is leading his party's attempt to wrest Punjab back from the Akali Dal-BJP after 10 years, says he prefers Facebook to Twitter which Nirvaan scopes out for him.

So are the recent Twitter battles that Amrinder Singh has waged with Delhi Chief Minister and AAP boss Arvind Kejriwal all Nirvaan's doing? No, says the grandson, fully crediting his grandfather. ""That was all him. I was reading what his opponents said about him and he said 'sneaky little fellow' and the other stuff, and I said well, you have to put it out there, all that you think,"" Nirvaan said smiling.

The rest, was headlines.

In the latest edition earlier this month, Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted after touring Patiala the constituency that Captain Amrinder Singh is contesting, ""Huge public support. Captain will lose his own election this time."" Captain had shot back, ""If you are so sure, why don't you come and fight me? You sneaky little fellow!""

Nirvan's millennial status is probably his best qualification for this job, more than his History Honours degree from St Stephen's. But its a job that lasts only till March 11, when votes will be counted in five states, including Punjab, where elections will be held in a single phase on February 4.

""After that, I'm getting married,"" said Nirvaan, who has worked in a media company before going full time with his granded a year ago"
"Goa Elections 2017: Congress Promises Free 5 Litres Of Petrol Per Month To Students","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-elections-2017-congress-promises-free-5-litres-of-petrol-per-month-to-students-1651822","Panaji:                             The Congress released its manifesto for the upcoming assembly elections in Goa, scheduled for February 4, in the presence of party MP Jyotiraditya Scindia in Panaji. According to the manifesto, the party has vowed to permanently close all casinos - including floating vessels mounted with gambling dens - in the state as well as free petrol upto five litres per month to every college student.

On the issue of casinos, Goa Congress chief Luizinho Faleiro proposed that the implementation of the ban would take place in phases. Offshore casinos, which are currently in river Mandovi, will be shut down in the first phase whereas onshore casinos would be banned in the second.

""Those on the shore too will be closed at a later stage,"" Mr Falerio added.

When asked if such a move would hamper employment in the state, he said, ""I don't think that there are many Goans working at these casinos.""

The Congress party also promises five litres of free petrol per month to every college student with a valid driving license in the state.

The Congress manifesto also states that the party ""strongly opposes holding defence expo in Goa or give permanent rights to the Defence Ministry to hold the land on lease or on ownership basis anywhere in the state."" It further assures the citizens of a thorough probe into permissions granted the state's Investment Promotion Board for establishing industries in Goa.

At the event, Mr Scindia also accused Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal of ""selling dreams"" to the people of Goa.

""It is the party that believes in building a castle of dreams... Macimum number of their MLAs are being questioned for their own corruption-related matters. I don't any paradigm that would be different about Goa,"" the Lok Sabha MP from Guna told reporters.

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had earlier stated that the party would contest 36 of the 40 constituencies in Goa. The remaining four will be accommodated to others under a seat-sharing agreement.

He did a complete u-turn today, saying his statements have been ""misconstrued"".

The temple issue, the 47-year-old leader told NDTV, is ""a personal matter of faith"" for him, but not an issue in this time's assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, which will vote in seven phases beginning next week.

The Election Commission has, citing a recent Supreme Court order, warned political parties to desist from seeking votes in the name of religion.

The ""main issue in the election is of lawlessness, murders, rapes, loots and caste based politics"" Mr Maurya said today, adding that if the BJP comes to power, ""goons will rot in jail.""

Keshav Prasad Maurya, who took over as the BJP's UP president in April last year, has an RSS or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh background. He was also a member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad or VHP, which led has led the demand for a Ram temple in Ayodhya. The RSS is the ideological mentor of both the BJP and the VHP.

The BJP has for many years now not included the Ayodhya temple as an election issue.

Mr Maurya is an Other Backward Caste or OBC leader and his appointment as state chief last year was seen as part of the party's strategy to woo that the BC vote bank in the state.

The BJP, which had won only 47 seats in the 2012 assembly elections, hopes to extend its performance in the 2104 national election in UP to this year's assembly election. The party had swept the state then winning 71 of UP's 80 seats.

Elections are being held in UP along with four others states - Punjab, Goa, Uttarkhand and Manipur - and votes will be counted in all them on March 11."

Someone fired shots and there was also a stampede and Mr Arya, unhurt in the incident, has accused Chief Minister Harish Rawat of the Congress of sanctioning an attack on him.

Mr Arya is a prominent Dalit leader of the Uttarakhand and was a minister in the Rawat government before he became Congress leader number 12 to rebel against the Chief Minister. He is what is being called a ""turncoat"" in this year's election - politicians who have just defected to the BJP but have already been fielded by it in the elections, causing immense heartburn in their new party.

The BJP has 10 such candidates in Uttarakhand, where it is contesting all 70 assembly seats.         

On January 16, Mr Arya along with his son, Sanjiv, was inducted into the BJP in the presence of party chief Amit Shah. Within hours the BJP confirmed that it would field both father and son in this year's election.

The BJP has alleged that Yashpal Arya was attacked in vendetta politics. ""There is a conspiracy underway to kill me. I was not only fired at. Even my vehicle was pelted with stones,"" Mr Arya alleged.

""It reflects the frustration of the Congress and the Chief Minister,"" said BJP's Uttarakhand president Ajay Bhatt.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat, known to take swiftly to social media to respond to his detractors hasn't issued a statement yet, nor has his party said anything.

The BJP acquired Mr Arya as it attempts to woo the Dalit community in Uttarakhand which it hopes to wrest from the Congress. In the last election, the Congress had won 32 seats, while the BJP had won 31 in a photo-finish. The Congress formed government and Harish Rawat also managed to survive a trust vote last year.

But 10 Congress legislators who commanded power and authority in the state unit are now in the BJP."
"Church Opposing BJP Is A False Perception During Polls: Laxmikant Parsekar","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/church-opposing-bjp-is-a-false-perception-during-polls-laxmikant-parsekar-1651851","Panaji:                             Minority community in Goa has shed its inhibitions towards the BJP and is no more averse to support the saffron party in elections, Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar said today.

He also said a ""false perception"" is being deliberately created during every election that Church has opposed BJP.

""During every election, an impression is created that Church is against us. Church is a religious institution and I would not like to comment on it. But one thing is sure that a few years back, minority brethren were suspicious about BJP and were staying away,"" Mr Parsekar told reporters in Goa.

Interestingly, the Goa Church yesterday expressed its concern over the government's push for cashless transactions, saying the Centre has ""shifted"" from its social policy of uplift of the poor by insisting on the digital transition.

The CM, contesting the February 4 elections from his pocket borough Mandrem, said the minorities have started having a ""positive outlook"" towards BJP.

""In the past, I had a personal experience in my own constituency. Initially, I failed to even open an account in the booths in minority-dominated wards. But it has changed. The situation was different in 2007...I got majority on those booths,"" he said, adding the minorities have started trusting the saffron party.

For total 40 seats going to polls on February 4, the BJP has fielded its candidates on 36 seats and is supporting Independent nominees in two constituencies.

Mr Parsekar said incumbent deputy Chief Minister Francis D'Souza was the first candidate from minority community to accept our candidature and became part of the government.

""After that several leaders from minority accepted our candidature. They were even with us in the government for five years,"" he said.

On the BJP refraining from projecting him as the Chief Ministerial face for the polls, Parsekar said he was never projected as the probable candidate even during the past.

Mr Parsekar replaced Manohar Parrikar as CM after the latter was made Defence Minister.

""I became CM and ran the government for more than two years. I don't want to answer someone's criticism. The election for the post of CM would be held democratically. Let us get the majority after that the elected representatives will decide on the CM candidate,"" he said.

Union minister and BJP's election in-charge in Goa, Nitin Gadkari recently caused a flutter when he said the next chief minister of Goa would be either from elected representatives or would be sent from the Centre, triggering speculations that he was pointing at Mr Parrikar, a Goan."

The request of the Election Commission comes ahead of the assembly elections in five states, which begin on February 8. According to the last rule of the Central Bank, one can withdraw Rs. 24,000 a week from banks. But no special provision has been made for the candidates contesting the assembly elections.

In its letter to the Reserve Bank, the Commission said it has been ""apprised of the problems"" the candidates are facing. The government, it said, has fixed a limit of expenditure, which is 28 lakh for Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and Rs. 20 lakh for Manipur and Goa. But given the cap of Rs. 24,000 on withdrawal per week, the candidates can withdraw only Rs. 96,000 over the three to four weeks left, the Commission pointed pointed out.

""Even considering that part of the expenditure will be incurred through cheque, petty and recurring expenditure is generally incurred in cash,"" the letter read. ""The issue is further compounded in rural areas, where banking facilities are not available or are negligible.""

The ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which came within a few hours of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise announcement on November 8, has been followed by a huge cash crunch as nearly 86 per cent of currency suddenly went out of circulation. The Reserve Bank imposed withdrawal limits from banks and ATMs. While the situation has eased as the new notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 2000 trickled into circulation, the RBI is relaxing the cash withdrawal rules in phrases.

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the central bank will remove restrictions on cash withdrawals only after assessing market situation and the government will not interfere in the process.

The elections, which will begin on February 8, will end in March. The results will be announced on March 11."

The BJP list had names of defectors from other parties, including former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Swami Prasad Maurya, who is contesting from Padrauna assembly seat in Kushinagar district.

BJP's senior leader in Uttar Pradesh Surya Pratap Shahi has been fielded from Pathardeva constituency in Deoria district.

With the third list of 67 candidates, the saffron party has so far announced a total of 371 candidates out of 403. Now, 32 seats are left, some of which will go to BJP's alliance partners Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).

BJP National Secretary Arun Singh, who announced the list, said the party has tried to give representation to every section of people in its list.

On being asked why there is not even a single Muslim candidate in BJP's list, Mr Singh said the party would field one as soon as it finds a ""suitable candidate"".

""We will give ticket to Muslims whenever we find a suitable candidate,"" he said.

To a question of many ""star-kids"" in the BJP list though the party openly criticises nepotism, Arun Singh said there is nothing wrong if a family member of a leader gets ticket on the basis of their work.

""If a person has been working for the party for several years, he can ask for a ticket even if he/she is a family member of an existing leader,"" Mr Singh said.

He said the BJP's ""approach is different"" from parties like Samajwadi Party and Congress which are ""run by one family only""."
"Election Commission Bars Schemes For Poll-Bound States In Union Budget","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/election-commission-bars-schemes-for-poll-bound-states-in-union-budget-1651904","New Delhi: HighlightsOpposition parties had challenged Budget announcement ahead of polls
Supreme Court ruled that Budget need not be delayed
Poll body says budget cannot have schemes specific for poll-bound states
                                No specific schemes can be announced in the union budget for the five states where assembly elections are due this year, the Election Commission has said. The Commission said, ""in the interest of free and fair elections"" and to maintain ""level playing field during elections"", no state specific schemes should be announced in the national budget, which may influence the voters in the five poll-bound states ""in favour of the ruling party"".

The Commission also said it should be ensured that in the Budget speech, ""the government's achievements in respect of the five states will also not be highlighted in any manner"".

The top election body's comments came after opposition parties complained to poll panel and wanted the budget to be postponed.

""We hope and we clearly say that it is the responsibility of the Election Commission and they must abide by their constitutional duty to ensure that polls are free and fair, that no kind of inducements which will impress upon the voter in the election in the five states would happen,"" news agency Press Trust of India had quoted Congress spokesperson Ajoy Kumar as saying.

Earlier on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the budget will be held on February 1. The order came in response to a petition that sought the budget be pushed back in view of the assembly elections in five states, so it would not influence the voters.

The court, however, said the union budget has ""nothing to do with states"". ""Throughout the year, there may be elections in different states, so should the centre not present the budget?"" the judges questioned.

Last year, the centre had announced that it would present the budget earlier than usual so it does not clash with the election schedule. Ending a practice that had started in the British era, the government also said the railway budget would be merged with the annual budget.

The elections in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur will begin on February 4. The results for all states will be announced on March 11."

He kickstarted his three-day visit of the state from Amritsar's Majitha where he attacked the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance as well as the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party. He will also address the public later today in Bathinda. While the Congress seeks to regain power in the state after a decade, the AAP - which won four seats in the 2014 Union elections - is contesting its first Assembly polls in the state. The Congress also managed to convince former BJP lawmaker Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife to join the party as its star campaigners in Punjab. After his three-day visit to Punjab, the Congress vice president will travel to the poll-bound state of Goa.

Here are the main highlights from Rahul Gandhi's speech:Punjab, the land of 5 rivers, used to support the entire nation.The state which not only used to fill the country's stomachs, but also fund the country's economy to a great extent.It was raining here yesterday. But Punjab's Badals don't rain down on its people.Despite Badals, the people of this state don't get water. They are deprived.Today, Punjab has a massive drug problem.Business and industry is shrinking - be it textile or manufacturing, industries are leaving the state.When you look around, only one family has a monopoly.Other states are progressing rapidly, but Punjab stands where it has been for decades. No improvement at all.If the Congress is voted to power, we will ensure strict action is taken against those involved in the drug racket. The Congress will show you all how we will defeat drugs.We will ensure farmers are benefitted. We will ensure the poor get their due.Punjab will get back the money it has lost over these years.The people of Punjab are being looted everyday. It is happening in one way or another. The Congress will ensure that this money returns to the people.Ask you brothers and sisters in Delhi, ask the Punjabis in Delhi if AAP has delivered anything.All they do is make false promises. Nothing is being done in Delhi. Ask the people of Delhi and they will tell you what the Congress did when we were in Delhi. We delivered. Delhi was progressing under Congress.Amarinder Singh has given his blood and sweat for Punjab.He has worked day and night for the betterment of Punjab.He has always worked for Punjabis, for Sardars. He is going to be our chief minister.Punjab has 'seva' in their tradition and culture.Guru Nanak ji spoke of seva and tera.  Guru Nanak ji had said sab ka sab tera.The Badals have converted that to sab ka sab mera.Modi ji says he is fighting corruption. He says he has done demonetisation.He says he will punish the corrupt. If that be the case, then please tell me how is he joining hands with the Badals? How can someone who says he's fighting the corrupt stand together with the Badals?People come here and say we'll solve Punjab's problems in 2 days, we'll find solutions in weeks and months.Tell me how that is possible? Do not believe them.Punjab's  problems will have to be solved with a lot of hard work by Amarinder Singh, by me, by us all. We all have to give our blood and sweat.Congress will deliver, not just make false promises of quick solutions.I told you all that Amarinder Singh will be the chief minister of Punjab.

State Congress chief Luizinho Faleiro said that in the first phase, casino boats that float in the Mandovi river would be shut down and in the second, onshore casinos would be targeted. The manifesto was released by former Congress Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in Panaji today.

Mr Faleiro said he did not fear that closing down casinos would affect jobs in the tiny tourist state. ""I don't think that there are many Goans working at these casinos,"" the Congress leader said.

Goa has six casino vessels and about a dozen onshore casinos that operate out of five star resorts. Together they contribute about 200 crore a year to the state revenue.

The Congress has earlier crossed swords with the state's ruling BJP over casinos which has asked why the party did not act against them when it was in power for two terms before the BJP returned.

The BJP had promised to shut down casinos when it was in the opposition and had floated that as a poll promise in 2012. After winning, however, it cited loss of revenue from a ban on mining for not closing casinos, but says that they ""haven't allowed any new casinos to come up and have not renewed any contracts."" All casinos, the BJP says, came up during Congress rule, but has been ambiguous on casinos in this election.

Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which makes its Goa debut, has taken a clear stance in its manifesto stating that it will shut down all casinos and will also provide alternative employment to close to 10,000 people employed by these.

All the parties peg their anti-casino stance on the ""degeneration of Goan culture"" that they allege these promote.

Goa votes on February 4 and after weeks of attempting an alliance with regional party Goa Forward, the Congress has announced that it will contest the assembly elections alone. It said on Saturday that it would contest 37 of the state's 40 seats.

In 2012, Goa threw out the Congress, with the party winning only seven seats. The BJP had won 21 of the 28 seats it had contested, a majority on its own. Then partner, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP had won three seats.

Fed up with bigger parties, who she says, have not done much for her village, the nonagenarian filed her nomination as an independent for the Khergarh assembly seat near Agra, Uttar Pradesh.

Though she looks frail, and can't walk without a stick, Jal Devi has been working for her village, trying to get build concrete roads. Two years ago, she won the panchayat elections from Jagner block, defeating her 32-year-old rival by more than 9,000 votes.

""Our village and area has very bad roads and the officials don't care,"" she said.

Sanjay, a 34-year-old farmer, who lives in Jal Devi's village, Jagner, agrees. ""Most leaders come here only before elections, asking for votes. Later, it is difficult to even get to talk to them,"" he said.

Asked how she plans to campaign in her constituency -- spread over 150 square km - she said, ""God has brought me this far and if he desires, he would take me further. My son is also there to take me to areas I can't get to on my own"".

Ramnath Singh, Jal Devi's youngest son, says he took voluntary retirement from the army. ""I realised that I needed to come back and work for the village,"" said the 50-year-old.

Besides Jal Devi, 166 candidates are in fray for the nine assembly seats of Agra, which goes to the polls on February 11. Her son Ram Nath Sikarwar is also standing for election as an independent candidate."

Jal Devi had to be escorted to the election office on a wheel chair yesterday.

She said that her aim is to root out corruption. She is already a member of the panchayat in Jagner block, having won with a record number of votes.

"Shivpal Yadav Not In Samajwadi Party's List Of Star Campaigners","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shivpal-yadav-not-in-samajwadi-partys-list-of-star-campaigners-1652346","Lucknow:                             Former Samajwadi Party (SP) state president Shivpal Singh Yadav does not figure in the list of 40 'star campaigners' issued by the party for the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections.

The former PWD Minister, who enjoyed the number two status in the state government, has since fallen from grace of his nephew and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav after a bitter power struggle in the party and the first family.

He has been already axed as the state unit chief and replaced by Akhilesh loyalist Naresh Uttam and been relegated to a virtual nobody in the party.

What is set to add injury to insult is the fact that barring Shivpal Singh Yadav, all other members of the Yadav clan who are in active politics have been named in the list.

This includes party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, Rajya Sabha member Ram Gopal Yadav, Kannauj MP and wife of the Chief Minister Dimple Yadav, Budayun MP Dharmendra Yadav, Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Singh and Lok Sabha member from Firozabad Akshay Yadav. Others in the list are Kironmoy Nanda, Naresh Agarwal, Mohd Azam Khan, Surendra Nagar, Sanjay Lathar, Udayveer Singh, Kamaal Akhtar and Neeraj Shekhar.

Under pressure from the party's mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav, Shivpal Singh has however been given ticket from his traditional Jaswantnagar seat in Etawah.

The latest move is likely to further upset Mulayam, who is said to be already annoyed with his son for unceremoniously ousting him as national president."
"UP Elections 2017: Now, A BJP Mini Pari-War In Western Uttar Pradesh","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-now-a-bjp-mini-pari-war-in-western-uttar-pradesh-1652775","Kairana:                             Seated in the lawn of her family home in Kairana in Western Uttar Pradesh, three hours east of Delhi, Mriganka Singh says ""by just being his daughter, why should I be denied an opportunity?""

Ms Singh is the daughter of Hukum Singh, a seven-time BJP legislator from the Kairana seat and presently its MP.

Her nomination, one of several seats given by the BJP to the children of its leaders, has raised eyebrows given the BJP's biting criticism of the dynastic Politics practised by its rivals.

Ms Singh is a political novice; she lives in Ghaziabad where she runs a school.

But she thinks she has a chance. ""The party may have assessed winnability factor as well,"" she tells NDTV.

Her father admits that his service to the party is one of the reasons why his daughter was selected.

""We never liked family in politics, but we can't deny them the rights also. If a member of the family deserves a political standing, then we shouldn't ignore him,"" said Hukum Singh.

But the Singh family may face an internal battle. The ticket to Mriganka has come at the cost of her own cousin, Anil Chauhan who contested the 2014 by-elections from a BJP ticket in Kairana but had lost with a very close margin.

Mr Chauhan has now joined the rival Rashtriya Lok Dal. He will be fighting against Ms Singh.

Both father and daughter however claim family politics is not the key issue. Law and order is, specifically the hounding out of mostly Hindu families from Kairana.

With these words Mr Singh has revived a controversy he had sparked last year by releasing lists of Hindu families, whom he claimed had left Kairana because of local Muslim criminal gangs. Kairana has a 50 per cent Muslim population.

Later, after the media had poked holes in those claims, Mr Singh said it was not a communal issue merely one of law and order.

He told NDTV on Wednesday that the list may have contained errors, but in election season that doesn't seem to have deterred him from reviving it.

""It (exodus) just happened because the entire business is in the hands of the Hindus: Vaishya, Jains, Brahmins. They are the easiest targets. They are peace loving. Some criminals who happen to be Muslims were terrorising them,"" said Mr Singh.

But are there no Muslim-run businesses in the area, similarly targeted? ""Muslims who are rich and who are running businesses were also targeted"", he added as an afterthought."
"'Don't Seek Votes In Name Of Religion, Caste': Election Commission To Parties","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dont-seek-votes-in-name-of-religion-caste-election-commission-to-parties-1652296","New Delhi:                             Don't seek votes in the name of religion and caste, the Election Commission warned political parties today ahead of polls in five states from February 4.

""Strictly follow the Supreme Court verdict, which said seeking votes in the name of religion, caste is a corrupt practice,"" the powerful election body said in a letter to all parties, directing them to ""instruct cadre to desist from soliciting votes in the name of religion and caste.""

The letter quotes extracts of the top court judgment.

In a separate letter to chief electoral officers of all states, the Commission said any activity of seeking votes in the name of religion and caste by or on behalf of any candidate or political party would now amount to violation of the provisions of the Mode Code of Conduct. The CEOs have been asked to inform the grassroots level election officials and ensure the compliance of the Supreme Court orders during elections.

Earlier this month, in a majority verdict, the Supreme Court held that appeal for votes on the ground of ""religion, race, caste, community or language"" amounted to ""corrupt practice"".

Referring to that order, the Election Commission said all parties should take note of it for ""strict compliance"".

""The political parties may also suitably brief and inform their lower formations and party cadres and all their candidates about the ruling of the Supreme Court and ask them to desist from any activities that would amount to soliciting votes in the name of religion, caste, etc in any manner, in their own interest and in the interest of the party. Such appeals may also fall within the ambit of... Model Code of Conduct,"" the letter to top bosses of all recognised national and state political parties said.

Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur will vote in assembly elections to be held in multiple phases between February 4 and March 8. The results will be announced on March 11.

"Uttarakhand Elections 2017: A Twist In The Tale As Chief Minister Harish Rawat Files Nomination For Kumaon Seat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-elections-2017-a-twist-in-the-tale-as-chief-minister-harish-rawat-files-nomination-for-k-1653066","Dehradun:                             In the season of rebellion in the Congress ranks in Uttarakhand, Chief Minister Harish Rawat faced a peculiar situation as he filed nomination from the Kichcha Assembly constituency in Kumaon on Wednesday. A senior Congress leader, Shilpi Arora, resigned from the party with a tweet explaining why she was quitting and launching a ferocious attack on the Chief Minister.

""I was forced to leave party and left with no option except fighting against @harishrawatcmuk from Kichcha as Independent Candidate,"" Ms Arora, who has been with the Congress for over 20 years, tweeted. She alleges she was promised that the party would nominate her from one of the nine assembly constituencies in Udhum Singh Nagar and that she had even begun groundwork there. However, after her name did not feature in the list of Congress candidates she felt ""betrayed by the false promises"".

The 44-year-old entrepreneur-turned-politician has now vowed to ""turn into Goddess Durga in order to defeat such demons,"" referring to Mr Rawat, who she described as ""Mahishasura,"" a dreaded demon killed by the Goddess in mythology, for ""backtracking on his commitment.""

Shilpi Arora said she would file  her nomination from Kichcha on Friday, the same day that Harish Rawat files nomination from the second seat he in contesting - Haridwar Rural in Garhwal.

Party insiders say Ms Arora, a state general secretary of the Congress, is from Gadarpur in Udhum Singh Nagar district and had been eyeing a ticket from the region for some time now. In place of her, the Congress fielded Rajendra Singh from Gadarpur.

As an Independent candidate from Kichcha, Ms Arora could use her popularity and sympathy wave to wrest a significant amount of vote-share from Rawat, leading to a tough competition, if not a loss of face for the Chief Minister. As an Independent, Ms Arora even stands a chance of joining ranks with any political party that may choose to solicit her support to form government in case she wins.

The BJP has reposed faith in its sitting lawmaker Rajesh Shukla, from Kichcha, to take on the Chief Minister. The saffron party hopes to capitalise on the wave of anti-incumbency against the current government to return to power in the state after five years.

Disgruntled Congress leaders across the state are either joining other parties or turning rebel as ""Independent"" candidates just before the assembly elections hitting the party's prospect of returning to power.

Sarika Pardhan, who was a minister in the ND Tiwari government of 2002 has also decided to fight the elections as an Independent candidate after the Congress fielded Godavari Thapli from Mussoorie. In all such instances, unhappy leaders have blamed the Chief Minister for their being denied ticket.

Reacting to Ms Arora's allegations, Surendra Kumar, the Chief Minister's media advisor, said, ""Shilpi Arora is a long-time member of the party and a valued leader. She may have made the outburst in an emotional moment. But we are in talks with her and will resolve all her grievances"".

Uttarakhand votes on February 15. Votes will be counted on March 11."

The list includes former Union minister Jitin Prasad and controversial leader Imran Masood. The party may come out with a second list soon.

Out of 41 candidates on the Congress list, eight are Muslims, which translates roughly to 20 per cent. This is in direct contrast to the two BJP lists, which do not any Muslim candidate so far.

Imran Masood, who was in the eye of a storm during 2014 Lok Sabha elections when a video clip emerged that allegedly showed him saying he would cut Narendra Modi into pieces if he ever came to his constituency. Masood was jailed for his alleged hate speech.

After an initial list of 41 candidates, the party's general secretary Madhusudan Mistry later released a list of two additional nominees cleared by the party's Central Election Committee (CEC), which includes Masud Akhtar from Saharanpur Nagar and Sherbaz Khan from Chandpur Assembly constituency.
 
The first list included these names:

"Arun Jaitley's 3 Reasons For BJP-Akali Winning Punjab Factors In AAP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-jaitleys-3-reasons-for-bjp-akali-winning-punjab-factors-in-aap-1651332","Amritsar:                             The addition of the Aam Aadmi Party in a traditionally bipolar contest will help the ruling BJP-Akali Dal alliance in the upcoming Punjab assembly elections next month, Union Minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said, also taking shots at ""absentee"" representatives in an apparent jab at cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu who defected to the Congress from his party.

Speaking in Amritsar on the campaign trail, Mr Jaitley, ""I have kept in touch with this city for a very long time not withstanding any election result. I do believe that Amritsar has had a very unfortunate experience over the past 12-and-a-half years of suffering from absentee MPs.""

The reference appeared to be a shot at Mr Sidhu, a three-time lawmaker elected from Amritsar who is often criticised by his opponents of abandoning the city for commercial interests in Mumbai. But countered over the 53-year-old's only recent separation from the BJP, Mr Jaitley said, ""Yes, we share the guilt for that and I'm not referring to only one, I'm referring to at least two who abstained from the city, and the constituency, who also abstained from parliament.""

Despite the 10-year-old regime fuelling anti-incumbency sentiments, Mr Jaitley said, he had three strong reasons to believe why the BJP-Akali combine would return to power. Besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi's continuing appeal and a general appreciation for the state government's performance, the entry of the Aam Aadmi Party would also help them divvying up the opposition to the ruling alliance, he said.

""Conventionally Punjab saw a direct election between Congress and the NDA (BJP-led National Democratic Alliance). This time there is a divided opposition to the NDA. Both the arithmetic and the chemistry will certainly dictate the election result,"" he said."

Union minister Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj Singh, the BJP's candidate from Noida, is ""200 per cent eligible,"" Mr Mathur said. 

After its multiple attacks on rivals like the Samajwadi Party and Congress for what it calls their ""dynastic politics,"" questions have been raised over the BJP's claim to being a party with a difference, given the number of relatives it is fielding in UP. This, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's firm no to family members of leaders contesting elections.

Mr Mathur told NDTV in an exclusive interview that reports of Rajnath Singh being upset at his son being overlooked as a BJP candidate in earlier elections were untrue. ""It is absolutely wrong to say that Rajnath Singh was angry and put pressure for a ticket for Pankaj Singh. I have seen Pankaj working for the party for 15 years now, he is an office-bearer. Pankaj Singh is 200% eligible to get a BJP ticket,"" the senior leader said. 

 As this reporter reeled off names of other sons and daughters that the BJP has announced as candidates in its first two UP lists - including the children and grandchildren of BJP leaders Lalji Tandon, Hukum Singh And Kalyan Singh - Mr Mathur said, ""All relatives given BJP tickets have worked for years - Lalji Tandon's son Gopal is a sitting lawmaker and has been fielded again.""The party also faces protests against new imports in the BJP being chosen as candidates over people who have worked in the party for years.  

Mr Mathur said the BJP has only allotted about 30 to 40 seats to those who have recently joined the party, roughly 10 per cent of the total seats announced, he said.  

Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who joined the BJP only three months ago after 24 years in the Congress, features in the list of 155 candidates declared yesterday, as does Brijesh Pathak, who recently joined the BJP after quitting Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party. Both will contest prestigious constituencies in state capital Lucknow.
  
About two dozen people who joined the party only recently had featured in the first list of 149 too, sparking protests. ""Outsiders are being given tickets only after pacifying BJP workers,"" insisted Mr Mathur."

The nickname 'Babush' which means baby boy in Portuguese language is shared by two prominent politicians - Deputy Chief Minister Fransic D'Souza and controversial former minister Atanasio Monserratte.

Mr D'Souza is contesting on a BJP ticket from Mapusa constituency and Mr Monserratte is challenging Manohar Parrikar-led BJP in his fiefdom of Panaji constituency.

Mr Monserratte who was expelled from the Congress has formed his own political outfit - United Goans Party.

'Babu', which also means baby boy, is associated with two prominent politicians who are famous more for their nicknames than their real names.

Congress legislator Chandrakant Kavlekar is known as Babu Kavlekar in his constituency. Similarly, former minister Manohar Asgaonkar is also known as Babu or Babu Asgaonkar.

Mr Asgaonkar, a former Congress legislator, had switched party loyalties in the last minute to join the MGP. He is now contesting from Pernem constituency against BJP minister Rajendra Arlekar. The constituency is reserved for Scheduled Castes.

In the remote Sattari taluka, Baba and Khashe are two names which are taken with due respect. 'Baba' is a nickname for Congress legislator Vishwajit Rane contesting from Valpoi constituency while his father and former Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane is referred to as 'Khashe'.

'Khashe' is usually a name for referring to a person who owns large tracts of land in Sattari taluka, located in the North Eastern part of the State.

'Bhau' and 'Bhayi' are two common names uttered in BJP circles. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar is known as 'Bhayi' meaning brother across the state amongst BJP cadres, while Union AYUSH minister Shripad Naik is referred to as 'Bhau' meaning elder brother.

Incidentally, former Congress legislator Pandurang Madkaikar who recently joined the BJP is also known as 'Bhau' in his constituency.

Former State Home Minister Ravi Naik who is contesting on Congress ticket in Ponda constituency is popularly known as 'Patrao', which in Portuguese means 'owner'.

Congress candidate from Canacona Isidore Fernandes is referred to as 'Boss', the nickname which he prominently displays on his vehicles.

Controversial former minister Fransisco Pacheco who is now contesting on Goa Su Raj party ticket from Nuvem constituency is famous as 'Miccky', the nickname which he shares with AAP Panaji candidate Walmiki Naik."

Mulayam Singh in meetings with Akhilesh Yadav had sought seats for 38
Akhilesh's list includes Shivpal, leaves out Mulayam's other close aides
                                Estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav has made Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's first list of 191 Samajwadi Party candidates, but several other close associates of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav have been left out. The candidates were announced today ahead of a formal announcement of the party's alliance for the Uttar Pradesh election with the Congress. The ruling party's first list of candidates covers the first three phases of the UP elections, which will be held in seven phases beginning February 11. The Samajwadi Party has said it will contest 300 of UP's 403 seats, with the balance being allotted to the Congress.

Akhilesh Yadav's list corrects an earlier list of candidates that his father Mulayam Singh Yadav had released last month, which left out several of the chief minister's key aides. Those associates like Atul Pradhan and Arvind Singh Gope are being fielded by the party now.

Senior minister Azam Khan, who played mediator between father and son in their bitter power struggle in the last few weeks, will contest again from his constituency Rampur. His son Abdullah Azam makes his debut as a Samajwadi Party candidate from Swaar. Both had also featured in Mulayam Singh's list of candidates.

But Shivpal Yadav's son Aditya has not been given a ticket by cousin Akhilesh Yadav. Mulyam Singh loyalists like current lawmakers Raghuraj Shakhya and Sukh Devi Verma have been dropped.

Today's list also leaves out candidates like Atiq Ahmed, a gangster-turned-politician with multiple criminal cases against him. He had earlier been announced as a Samajwadi Party candidate by Mulayam Singh at the behest of Shivpal Yadav, even though Akhilesh Yadav had strongly opposed fielding him.

Shivpal Yadav, who will contest Jaswantnagar, the constituency he represents, is in many ways the crux of the feud between the Chief Minister and his father Mulayam Singh. In the months before the crucial UP elections, Shivpal Yadav had challenged the Chief Minister on key decisions and was consistently backed by Mulayam Singh.

Last month, Akhilesh Yadav had announced his own candidates in defiance of his father's list and was later declared Samajwadi Party president by his supporters in place of his father at a party meeting.  

Earlier this week, the Election Commission recognised Mr Yadav as the party's president and granted him use of the party's cycle symbol rejecting his father's claim. After the poll panel's order, Mulayam Singh had handed his son a list of 38 candidates that he wants the party to field, among them Shivpal Yadav."

Akhilesh Yadav is reportedly talking to Congress to sort out differences.
Congress was voted out of power in UP by Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989.
                                The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance which was promising to alter the political equations for assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is in trouble with both sides calling the other's demands for more seats unreasonable.

Amidst building tension, sources in the Samajwadi Party say that all is not over and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is holding talks with Congress leaders through back channels to iron out the differences. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi met sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad at his residence today.

At the heart of the trouble are two key issues - how many seats will each get and which seat will go to which party.

The two parties had sent out all the right signals till Monday last. But when the two camps sat down for seat-sharing talks, trouble erupted. Senior Samajwadi Party leaders today indicated that Akhilesh Yadav, who has already announced 210 candidates - some even on seats held by Congress legislators - may announce more candidates over the next 24 hours, since the time is running out and nominations for the first phase end on January 24.

The chief minister is not waiting for the alliance to be thorough in more ways. Tomorrow, Akhilesh Yadav will release his party's manifesto in Lucknow.

Sensing trouble, top Congress leaders have rushed to Lucknow. The Congress, which has been reduced to player number 4 in Uttar Pradesh, is eyeing the alliance to recover ground. While senior Samajwadi leaders maintain that the Congress does not have the footprint strength to demand nearly 130 seats, the Congress says anything less will hurt the national party's interest. Samajwadi Party sources say the alliance is not taking off as the Congress wants it to surrender some seats it had won in 2012.

However, insiders say that the real tussle is over seats where minority vote holds sway. The Congress was edged out of power in Uttar Pradesh by Akhilesh Yadav's father Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989. The rise of Mullah Mulayam brought the drift of minority vote to the Samajwadi Party from the Congress.

While the Samajwadi Party is keen to maintain its most favoured party status among Muslims, the Congress wants to regain lost ground via the alliance."

Ms Joshi, a former Congress chief from the state, joined the BJP only in October, 2016. Lucknow Cantt is the seat she won in 2012 and this year's contest could pitch her against Aparna Yadav, the second daughter-in-law of Mulayam Singh Yadav, if the Samajwadi Party fields her from the constituency.

Brijesh Pathak, another leader who recently joined the BJP after quitting Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party has been been given a ticket from Lucknow Central.  

Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's firm no to family members of party men contesting elections, the BJP received requests to accommodate almost 50 sons, daughters and other relatives from BJP leaders for this year's UP elections, to be held in seven phases from February 11. The first list had included Sandeep Singh, grandson of former chief minister Kalyan Singh - now the governor of Rajasthan.  

Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj will contest as the BJP candidate from Noida. Pankaj Singh wanted to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but was not fielded by the BJP then. But he has been active in politics and has also held party positions.

It is Mriganka Singh's candidacy from Kairana that is expected to cause the dismay in a party that celebrates ""one party, one post."" Mriganka Singh is a political novice and already a senior BJP leader Anil Chauhan has quit the party last week protesting against the plan to field her.

Ashutosh Tandon, the son of BJP veteran Lalji Tandon has been fielded again from Lucknow North, the seat he had won in 2012. Mr Tandon's candidacy had in the last election raised allegations of the BJP indulging in the dynastic politics it accuses rivals like the Congress and Samajwadi Party of.

Another son and ""outsider"" in today's list is Utkarsh Maurya, the son of Swami Prasad Maurya who crossed over from the BSP six months ago. About two dozen people who joined the party only recently had featured in the first list of 149, sparking protests. A meeting to decide on the second list had to be delayed.

The BJP had won only 47 seats in the last assembly election but sees its best chance in years to win UP again after sweeping 71 of states 80 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections."
"Why BJP Chief Amit Shah Is Facing 'Friendly Fire' Right Outside His Home","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/why-bjp-chief-amit-shah-is-facing-friendly-fire-right-outside-his-home-1650642","New Delhi:                             Outside BJP chief Amit Shah's home in Delhi today, several buses arrived and disgorged crowds of supporters carrying what appeared to be party posters. They didn't come in peace. Loud slogan-shouting erupted within seconds. Despite Mr Shah's warning to party men not to lobby for or protest against candidates for next month's state elections, the BJP is facing minor mutinies several times a day.

Today's first group of protesters was from Dhaulana town in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP has named Ramesh Chandra Tomar as its candidate. YP Singh was the party's choice in the previous polls. His supporters loudly and relentlessly tried to seize Mr Shah's attention. They are angry that Dharmesh Tomar, a turn-coat, has been named BJP candidate. Mr Tomar won the seat in the previous 2012 state polls as a Samajwadi candidate, reducing the BJP's YP Singh to a poor third. The BJP is seen to be betting on caste equations by fielding Mr Tomar.

The second group of ""rebels"" was from Amroha, also in UP. The protesters shouted slogans for Devendra Nagpal, who says he has been denied a chance in the Naugavan constituency.

The BJP has chosen ex-cricketer Chetan Chauhan, who represented the Amroha parliamentary seat long ago but is now being dubbed an ""outsider"" by Mr Nagpal's loyalists.

Tarsem Singh, a BJP worker holding a protest placard, said, ""The local BJP's views have not been considered. Mr Chauhan has no chance of winning as he has not been in Amroha since his term as MP ended. ''

The protestor alleges that the party has set up a walkover for the Samajwadi Party's Mehboob, a four-term MP, by choosing Mr Chauhan.

The shouting bunch finally got a hearing with the BJP's points person for the Uttar Pradesh polls, senior leader Om Mathur.

In the last three days, at least 10 groups have challenged the choices made by the party's central election committee headed by Amit Shah, which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The incessant protests reflect that the party's effort to add leaders from rival parties is backfiring and also threatens to upset caste calculations.

Yesterday, another group of protestors from UP were assured that the party will not field a turncoat from Noida, like in the case of Dadri and Jewar.

In Dadri, the BJP is fielding Tejpal Nagar, 58, and in Jewar, 50-year-old Dhirendra Singh is the candidate. They are both recent recruits, taken not before 2014.

Due to the unrest in these two seats, the party has delayed naming a candidate in Noida."
"Mayawati Party Man SP Maurya, Who Joined BJP, Eyes Another Move. Akhilesh Yadav Gets Call","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sp-maurya-who-left-mayawatis-party-for-bjp-calls-akhilesh-yadav-1650304","Lucknow:                             Swamy Prasad Maurya, strategically poached by the BJP from Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party only six months ago in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh election, is said to be evaluating another change of party. There is speculation that the politician, who is said to command significant support from some sections of UP's Other Backward Caste or OBC voters, is unhappy with the party's selection of candidates for next month's assembly elections and could join Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party.

Mr Maurya told NDTV that he has been in touch with Akhilesh Yadav and offered fulsome praise for the 43-year-old UP Chief Minister. ""I congratulated him for his victory...He is a young and dynamic leader and a very good human being. We share a very good personal relationship,"" Mr Maurya said, referring to Mr Yadav winning the use of the Samajwadi Party name and symbol in a feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav.

He was equally candid about his problems in the BJP. ""I am struggling to get ticket for supporters from my community who moved from the BSP with me,"" he said, very clear that he is asking for his due share. The former BSP man is said to have demanded 35 of UP's 403 seats for him and his supporters, including a son and a daughter, to contest. The BJP, sources said, is willing to concede no more than five.

The BJP had inducted Mr Maurya last August as it sought to consolidate voters belonging to different sections and communities for the mega UP elections, being pegged as a semi-final before 2019 national election.

Mr Maurya draws his support from the Maurya, Kushwaha, Saini and Shakya communities. He was Leader of Opposition in the UP assembly before he quit the BSP, accusing Ms Mayawati of ""selling assembly ticket to candidates.""

Other parties are said to have approached Mr Maurya too at that time and there was talk of negotiations with the Samajwadi Party. The BJP had won, but as Mr Maurya had joined the party in Delhi he had asked it to treat his supporters well. Some had joined with him and many more would follow, he had promised."
"Congress Rejects Akhilesh Yadav's Final Offer Of 99 Seats, Alliance Nearly Over","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congress-rejects-akhilesh-yadavs-offer-of-99-seats-alliance-with-samajwadi-party-in-trouble-1651261","New Delhi: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav's list of candidates left the Congress upset
Congress seeks 110 seats, rejects final offer by Akhilesh, say sources
Congress was voted out of power in UP by Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989
                                The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance which was promising to alter the political equations for Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh is in trouble. Hectic negotiations for the last few days hit a wall on Friday when both sides, off the record, called the other's demand for more seats unreasonable. Amidst building tension, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav started talks with Congress leaders through back channels to iron out the differences since Saturday morning.

At the heart of the trouble were two key issues - how many seats will each get and which seat will go to which party.

By evening the talks were stalled once again. Akhilesh Yadav, who started bargaining from not more than 85 seats in the morning made the final offer by late afternoon. He has now put them all in the Congress's court by agreeing to give 99 of the 403 seats to the Congress. But the Congress wants nothing less than 104 - it had asked for 110.

The two parties had sent out all the right signals till Monday last. But when the two camps sat down for seat sharing talks trouble erupted. Senior Samajwadi Party leaders today indicated that Akhilesh Yadav who has already announced 210 candidates - some even on seats held by Congress legislators - may announce few more if talks fail as time is running out and nominations for the first phase are ending on January 24.

The chief minister is not waiting for the alliance to be through in more ways. Tomorrow, Akhilesh Yadav will be releasing his party's manifesto in Lucknow.

Sensing tie-up trouble, top Congress leaders had rushed to Lucknow. The Congress which has been reduced to player number four in Uttar Pradesh was eyeing the alliance to recover ground. While senior Samajwadi Party leaders maintain that the Congress doesn't have the footprint strength to initially demand nearly 130 seats, the Congress says anything less will hurt the national party's interests.

Samajwadi Party sources say the alliance is not taking off as the Congress wants it to surrender some seats it had won in 2012.

However, insiders say that the real tussle is over seats where minority vote holds sway. The Congress was edged out of power in Uttar Pradesh by Akhilesh Yadav's father Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989. The rise of 'Mullah Mulayam' brought the drift of minority vote to the Samajwadi Party from the Congress. While the Samajwadi Party is keen to maintain its most favoured party status among Muslims, the Congress wants to regain lost ground via the alliance."
"A Small Village In Uttar Pradesh Makes A Big Election Pledge","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/a-small-village-in-uttar-pradesh-makes-a-big-election-pledge-1651110","Chandaur village, Banda district, Uttar Pradesh:                             Almost all the 4,500 residents of Chandaur, a small village in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, are gathered in front of the primary school to discuss the assembly elections in the state, but within minutes it turns into a full-fledged protest. The villagers are angry with the lotus, the hand, the cycle, the elephant and every other symbol that represents a political party. None, they say, have done any work for them. The sitting MLA here, is from the Bahujan Samaj Party.

One by one, villagers take the microphone, their voices filled with anguish and anger at an electoral process which they feel merely exploits their vote. Their message now - Chandaur will not vote.

Anand Kumar, a young daily wager says for years young men in this village have struggled to get an education. When they do get an education, they don't get jobs. Like Shiv Bodhan, who is in his thirties and has a Masters degree in Arts but is unemployed. ""What's the point of our degrees when to get jobs you need to have money to bribe people? Politicians tell us they will focus on the youth but our ears have tired of listening to these lies,"" Bodhan says, adding, ""We don't have a job, they don't have a vote.""

Malkhan Lal, who works on farms and as labour, thrusts a sheaf of papers at us to show how many court cases are pending here. ""We're from a poor village in Bundelkhand, so no judge, no lawyer is interested in us or our cases. Whether it is about land or about the identification required for ration cards, we have been fighting just to get our basic entitlements. Yet each elections, like mules we would go to vote. No more.""

Years of drought have pushed the people of Chandaur into desperate poverty and helplessness. 70-year-old Gujaratiya says she can't vote for people who don't care whether she lives or dies. ""I have two children who are waiting to be married but who can think of marriage when we go hungry for days."" Every election, Gujaratiya says, she ""would obediently go to vote,"" but now believes that ""This democracy is for rich people not us.""

Village pradhan Ramchandar, who is in his fifties, says it is ironic that Chandaur's election boycott has drawn the attention of local politicians and journalists, but its hardships never did. ""I am with my people on this. All 4,500 of us will not vote in these elections,"" he says.

Unlike other villages, which have announced a boycott of elections and later turned up to vote, Ramchandar says, ""It will not happen here.""

"Samajwadi Party Meets Congress Halfway In Gandhi Turf","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-meets-congress-halfway-in-gandhi-turf-1651519","Lucknow: HighlightsCongress and SP will contest 5 seats each in Amethi and Raebareli
Congress and SP formally announced an alliance for the UP polls on Sunday
Congress will contest 105 of the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh
                                The Samajwadi Party and the Congress will contest five assembly seats each in Uttar Pradesh's Raebareli and Amethi, which are the respective parliamentary constituencies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi. The 10 assembly seats in the Gandhi turf were said to have been a key point of disagreement in intense negotiations between the two parties, which formally announced their alliance for the upcoming UP elections on Sunday.

The Samajwadi Party has announced candidates for three of five seats in Raebareli and two of five seats in Amethi. The rest have been allotted to the Congress to contest.

In the 2012 assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party had won seven of the 10 seats whereas the Congress won two. Of the five seats that the Congress will contest this time, it had placed second to the Samajwadi Party in one seat and won two. Now, the Congress is contesting Raebareli for the seats where the independent had won.

The Congress and SP were expected to announce their alliance on Friday but reportedly could not agree on how many, and which, seats would each party contest. Talks, however, broke down when Akhilesh Yadav announced Samajwadi Party candidates for nine seats that the Congress had won in the last elections.

""It was never about Raebareli and Amethi,"" said senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday, insisting that the Congress had not made a prestige point about those seats.

""We wanted a certain number of seats and become part of the alliance with respect. Of the 10 seats now, we have half, they have half,"" he said.

In the alliance announced on Sunday, the Congress will contest 105 seats, up six from the 99 that Akhilesh Yadav had offered on Saturday.

Mr Azad, who is the Congress leader in charge of UP, credited Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the daughter of party chief Sonia Gandhi for the alliance coming through.

""I want to congratulate Priyanka Gandhiji for her efforts. It's a very difficult thing to form an alliance after years of contesting against each other,"" Mr Azad said.

Another senior leader Ahmed Patel had tweeted on Sunday morning:Ms Vadra had, so far, confined her political activity to her mother and brother's constituencies. In 2012, she had vowed to deliver a perfect 10 in Rae Bareli and Amethi. The Samajwadi Party, however, had upset those plans."
"'Don't Know If Alliance On,' Says Congress After Samajwadi Googly","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dont-know-if-alliance-on-says-congress-after-samajwadi-googly-1650924","Lucknow:                             Hours before a formal announcement was expected, an alliance appeared untenable on Friday after the Samajwadi Party named candidates for seven Uttar Pradesh seats that the Congress currently holds and a senior leader of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's party said that it could offer its potential partner only 80 to 85 of UP's 403 assembly seats.

""No alliance at the cost of Congress workers' self-respect,"" said the party's state chief Raj Babbar, refusing to say whether the alliance with the Samajwadi Party is on or not. Mr Babbar was expected to announce the alliance this evening with his Samajwadi Party counterpart Naresh Uttam.

""We are a big party and we cannot compromise on our workers' interest,"" Mr Babbar said.

There has so far been talk of the Samajwadi Party wanting to contest 300 of UP's 403 seats and allotting the rest to the Congress. But the Samajwadi Party's Kiranmoy Nanda today said the Congress should ideally be given no more than 54 seats to contest. ""Other than that we can give them 30-35 seats...First let the alliance happen,"" he said, emphasising that, ""We haven't received anything from the Congress side yet.""

84 to 85 seats, Mr Nanda said, was his party's best offer to the potential ally, whose top leaders had earlier this week said that the Congress will contest the UP elections in partnership with the Samajwadi Party. Only a formal announcement was awaited.

""The Samajwadi Party's key agenda is to defeat the BJP, while the Congress wants to strengthen its position in UP,"" Mr Nanda said. 

There has been speculation that the Samajwadi Party could balance today's seat allotment by giving the Congress more seats to contest in the Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Lok Sabha constituencies of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi, but Mr Nanda ruled that concession out too. The Samajwadi Party, he pointed out, holds seven out 10 assembly seats in that area, and would field winning candidates from there.

The Samajwadi Party has named 191 candidates today for constituencies where elections will be held in the first three phases of the seven-phase UP election. 

The Congress had won 29 seats in the last assembly elections in UP."

The opposition party said it has not stitched a formal alliance, but has only entered into a seat-sharing pact with Goa Forward, launched a year ago, and others for the February 4 elections.

""This is not an alliance. This is purely a seat-sharing agreement that we are having based on winnability of candidates,"" All India Congress Committee General Secretary Digvijay Singh told PTI.

Under the arrangement, Congress has left two seats - Fatorda and Siolim - for Goa Forward. Vijai Sardesai, the fledgling outfit's mentor, is contesting from Fatorda.

Congress has agreed to let its expelled legislator Atanasio Monserratte, who has floated his own outfit United Goan Party, fight from from the Panaji seat.

Independent legislator Rohan Khaunte will be supported by Congress in the Porvorim constituency.

""We want to defeat the BJP which ran a Government of U turns,"" Mr Singh said, adding that his party is supporting these non-Congress candidates to defeat BJP.

Congress had earlier ruled out aligning with NCP, a former partner which asked for two seats - Benaulim and Vasco.

However, Congress and Goa Forward candidates will face each other in Saligao and Velim segments, where the two parties have no understanding."

State ministers Indira Hridyesh, Surendra Singh and Dinesh Aggarwal will contest from Haldwani, Kotdwar and Dharampur constituencies respectively. Other Congress leaders included in the list are Mantri Prasad Naihani, Harish Chandra Durgapal and Goving Singh Kunjwal who have been respectively fielded from Deoprayag, Lalkuwa and Jageshwar.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat has been fielded from Kiccha and Haridwar Rural constituencies.

The Uttarakhand polls will be a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress. According to news agency PTI, both parties are seeking a mandate on the agenda of development. Chief Minister Harish Rawat will also that the BJP-led Centre had dismissed the Congress-led state government till it was restored by the judiciary. The Congress has also roped in political strategist Prashant Kishor, whom Mr Rawat described as 'Chyawanprash', for the Uttarakhand polls.

""Kishor is like Chyawanprash... People resort to such tonics as they age,"" MR Rawat was quoted, by PTI, as saying.

Many senior Congress leaders from the state, including former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, resigned from the party to join the BJP. However, the BJP's decision to field these ex-Congressmen from various constituencies has led to resentment among the senior BJP leaders from the state including Om Gopal Rawat, Asha Nautiyal and Shailendra Singh Rawat.

Sai moved an application before Additional Sessions Judge PS Gadhvi, stating he could contest on two seats--Sahibabad in Ghaziabad district and Shivpur in Varanasi.

Seeking the relief, he stated that Ojaswi Party, of which he is one of the founders, wants to field candidates in the elections and that he needs to be out of jail to oversee the preparations.

The court kept the matter for hearing on January 21. Sai was arrested for allegedly raping a Surat-based woman disciple of his father between 2002 and 2005. Seven persons, including Sai and his aides were charged under sections of Indian Penal Code for rape, unnatural sex, molestation, wrongful confinement, unlawful assembly, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy.

The woman had accused Sai of repeated sexual assault when she was living at Asaram's ashram in Surat.

The victim's elder sister had also made similar allegation against Sai's father Asaram while she was living at an ashram on the outskirts of Ahmedabad between 1997 and 2006.

The two sisters had lodged separate complaints against Sai and Asaram for allegedly raping them.

He was arrested near the Delhi-Haryana border in December 2013 after evading law for two months following registration of the case against him.

Sai has been lodged at Lajpore Central Jail in Surat since December 2013.

Asaram is also facing trial in rape cases and lodged in a jail in Jodhpur."

""They are opposing triple talaq. BJP has already been given talaq twice in the Delhi and Bihar polls.

 He accused the Centre of ""unleashing a financial emergency"" in the name of demonetisation and claimed that the move was expected to have a bearing on the country's economic growth.

Meanwhile, CPI general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said the NDA government did not take any step to arrest the likes of Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya, while BJP leader Gali Janardhan Reddy was not arrested, in spite of spending a huge amount on his daughter's wedding after the currency ban.

Assembly Elections were just four months away, but Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Suresh Prabhu, Piyush Goel promised Bengal a bonanza.

This time, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley did not attend the summit, even though his name was number four on the invitation card to the opening session, after President Pranab Mukherjee, Governor Kesari Nath Tripathi and Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal.

Given the head-on confrontation between Mamata Banerjee and PM Narendra Modi on demonetisation, no one is surprised at the turn of events.

However, the star of the show, President Pranab Mukherjee fully backed his host's bid to woo business to Bengal and sent out a message to her and to the missing guest, Arun Jaitley.

""When I was sent the invitation to attend the meet, I thought whether it will be proper to do that as President of the republic. But I felt that as India has cooperative federalism, it lays on the strength of every state. India's strength lies in cooperative federalism especially when it comes to economic development,"" he said.

Business delegations came in from 29 countries, 350 of them from Germany, South Korea, Poland and from across India.

""As businessmen I am disappointed. Last year Mr Jaitley had said India's progress depends on the states progress all together,"" said Rajeev Kaul, NICCO chairman.

""We are facing hardship because of demonetisation and remonetisation. Come to Bengal. We are giving relief to industry,"" said Ms Banerjee.

Another little bump was a wildcat protest outside the venue on Bhangar, where two people were shot dead on Tuesday during protests over alleged land grab.

The state government has staunchly denied that the clash was over land-grab. There were barely a hundred people at the protest, but due to the emotive issue, the chief minister was not pleased. But the state BJP was, not just about the Bhangar protest by the Left but also because they had urged party top brass to skip the summit. And they had been heard."

Earlier this month, addressing an election rally in Goa's Benaulim, Mr Kejriwal had said, ""If Congress or BJP candidates offer money, do not refuse it. Accept it as your own money. But when it comes to voting, press the button against the name of the AAP candidate.""

Mr Kejriwal, calling the Election Commission order wrong, said he will challenge it in court. ""EC order agnst me completely wrong. Lower court gave order in my favor. EC ignored court's order. Will challenge EC's latest order in court (sic),"" Mr Kejriwal tweeted in his defence.

The Election Commission, which had sent a notice to Mr Kejriwal earlier this week, had said that, prima facie, it is of the opinion that Mr Kejriwal's statements at the rally violated the Model Code of Conduct which came into force in Goa on January 4. It said that the Delhi Chief Minister's statement amounts to ""abetting and promoting electoral offence of bribery"". It further said that strict action will be taken should Mr Kejriwal fail to respond by the afternoon of January 19.

The Congress had taken offence to Mr Kejriwal's comments and had demanded the Election Commission to take action.

""Kejriwal's appeal to the people to take money from all political parties and vote for AAP is a clear case of inducing people to be corrupt. This is an insult to the sensitive voters from Goa,"" Congress spokesperson Trajano D'Mello had said.

The Aam Aadmi Party has fielded former Inspector General of Prisons Elvis Gomes as their Chief Ministerial candidate in Goa, which goes to polls on February 4."

Governments not allowed to make populist move to sway voters before polls
                                The government's annual budget will not be moved from February 1 to after the elections in states like Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court ruled today.

The petitioner, an advocate named ML Sharma, had argued that the centre could seek to influence the outcome of the polls with populist spending promises. Election rules do not allow governments to offer giveaways or make any announcements that could skew voters towards the party in power at the centre or in states.

But the court today said that the union budget has ""nothing to do with states "" and stressed that elections in states are held so often that they cannot impede the work of the centre. ""Throughout the year, there may be elections in different states, so should the centre  not present the budget?"" judges asked.

 The Finance Ministry began printing the budget documents last week.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government announced last autumn that it would deliver its budget a month earlier than usual for the 2017/18 financial year. The budget session of parliament will start on January 31 when the government is expected to present the Economic Survey, which sets the scene for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's fourth annual budget.

The cabinet decided last September to merge the railway budget with the annual budget, ending a nearly century-long practice. It also advanced the date of the general budget, usually the last working day in February, to ensure proposals take effect from April 1.

The five state elections begin on February 4 in  Punjab and Goa on February 4, followed by Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh (which votes on seven days)  and Manipur. Results for all will be announced on March 11."
"Unhappy Over Election Seats, Congress Workers Vandalise Party Office In Uttarakhand","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/unhappy-over-election-seats-congress-workers-vandalise-party-office-in-uttarakhand-1651522","Dehradun/New Delhi:                             Congress party office in Dehradun was vandalised by party workers who were unhappy over the ticket distribution for the assembly elections in Uttarakhand. The workers threw chairs, broke furniture, tore off posters. Some workers also raised slogans against Chief Minister Harish Rawat.

The Congress has released a list of 63 candidates for the polls scheduled for February 15. Mr Rawat will contest from two seats: Hardwar Rural and Kichha.

 Most outgoing legislators have been repeated by the Congress. State ministers Indira Hridyesh, Surendra Singh and Dinesh Aggarwal will contest from Haldwani, Kotdwar and Dharampur constituencies respectively. Other Congress leaders who made the cut were Mantri Prasad Naihani, Harish Chandra Durgapal and Goving Singh Kunjwal who have been respectively fielded from Deoprayag, Lalkuwa and Jageshwar.

Suryakant Dhasmana, who was acquitted by the CBI court in 2012 in connection with killing one person and injuring two persons during the Uttarakhand movement, has been fielded from Dehradun Cantt. 

State Congress chief Kishore Upadhyay will contest from Sahaspur.

Mr Rawat tried to play down the controversy, saying some ticket hopefuls were unhappy they had not been fielded by the party.

The Congress has also roped in political strategist Prashant Kishor for the elections. ""Kishor is like Chyawanprash... People resort to such tonics as they age,"" MR Rawat was quoted, by PTI, as saying.

A 70-member Uttarakhand assembly will be elected on February 15.

Mr Singh is camping in Goa to oversee the Congress' campaign for the Goa elections.

""This whole election has now become extremely important for Manohar Parrikar. He is fighting Goa polls as his own election, making it a prestige issue for himself,"" the veteran Congress leader told reporters in Goa.

""Parrikar is now not acting as the Defence Minister of India, but as self-defence minister of Goa,"" the Rajya Sabha member further jibed and further claimed that Mr Parrikar's credibility within the BJP is on the line.

Referring to the Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM) formed by rebel RSS member Subhash Velingkar, Mr Singh said, ""RSS has openly come out against this government and are out to defeat Parrikar-led BJP in Goa.""

Digvijaya Singh also took on the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party, which has projected former Inspector General of Prisons Elvis Gomes as their chief ministerial candidate.

""You can see the performance of the inexperienced MLAs and ministers in Delhi, where more than 50 AAP MLAs are charged with corruption, forgery and others,"" he claimed.

On January 19, the Congress party had stated that it would contest 36 of the 40 constituencies in the upcoming Goa elections. The remaining four will be left for other parties. ""This is not an alliance. This is purely a seat-sharing agreement that we are having based on winnability of candidates,"" Mr Singh had, then, said.

"Samajwadi Tie-Up Wobbles, Congress Says Will 'Talk to Akhilesh Yadav'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-akhilesh-yadav-tie-up-wobbles-priyanka-and-rahul-gandhi-lead-sos-meet-1650957","New Delhi: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav's list of candidates leaves Congress upset
He has given 9 seats held by Congress to his own candidates
Congress meets to review proposed alliance with Akhilesh Yadav
                                The Congress has said it is ""unfortunate"" that the Samajwadi Party has announced candidates for nine assembly seats that the Congress holds and admitted it has called their proposed partnership for the Uttar Pradesh elections into question. The party said senior leader Guhlam Nabi Azad would talk to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav now.  

""I will be able to talk about the SP alliance once Ghulam Nabi meets Akhilesh Yadav, said Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken, adding, ""We have said that this alliance was concluded earlier with Akhilesh Yadav. Now we will call him again. It's unfortunate that seats of nine sitting MLA s are being taken away... any agreement should be honoured.""

Mr Maken's comments came after top Congress leaders held emergency meetings in Delhi to discuss whether and how to salvage the partnership with Akhilesh Yadav, that, both parties have for days declared as almost finalised. While Rahul Gandhi, Congress Vice President met his sister Priyanka at his home, other senior party leaders held a separate meeting.

Akhilesh Yadav scripted a major plot twist earlier today when he released a list of Samajwadi Party candidates for 191 seats, including seven currently held by Congress legislators. In another list of 18 that he released later, two Congress seats were listed.

Naturally, the Congress would like to retain those constituencies among the share that it would get as part of an alliance. But Akhilesh Yadav, who is seeking re-election as Chief Minister, is, according to sources, putting the squeeze on the Congress, which, without his partnership, stands far removed from the contest for the key state of Uttar Pradesh, with a stack of electoral defeats both in the last state election in 2012 and the general election two years later.

Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party has said that of the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh, it wants its own nominees to contest more than 300. The Congress should ideally get 54 seats, said SP leader Kiranmoy Nanda today, adding ""another 30 to 35"" at the most - which would give the Congress about 80 or 85 as opposed to the 100 it wants.

The last 48 hours have proved rough for what was being billed as the Grand Alliance or Maha Gathbandhan of Uttar Pradesh, a grouping of non-BJP parties modelled on the coalition that won Bihar in 2015. Ajit Singh and his Rashtriya Lok Dal or RLD, a party with a strong grip on the Jats, especially in Western Uttar Pradesh (which votes ahead of other parts), have decided against teaming with the Congress and Akhilesh Yadav, again because of smaller share of seats than desired.  

No sweat, retorted the Samajwadi Party, stressing that any association with the RLD could damage its standing among loyal Muslim supporters in Western UP, who are wary of Jats after the communal riots of 2013 which left nearly 60 people dead and several thousands homeless."

BJP's UP executive member Neeraj Shankar Saxena moved a petition against Mayawati on Saturday demanding that her party be debarred from contesting polls and filing of FIR against her for ""flouting"" Supreme Court directives.
    
""Mayawati during her press conference on December 24 and January 3 presented caste-wise details of ticket distribution clearly stating that her party has given tickets to how many Muslims, backwards, SCs and others,"" Mr Saxena told PTI.
    
Besides, her party men are distributing booklets titled ""Muslim samaj ka sachcha hitaishi kaun-faisla aap karein"" in all the constituencies, he claimed, adding this too was against the Supreme Court directives that votes cannot be sought on the basis of caste, community or language.
    
On January 3, Mayawati had said in a press conference that of the 403 seats, 85 are reserved for the SCs and 87 tickets have been given to Dalits, 97 to Muslims, 106 to OBCs, 66 to Brahmins, 36 to Kshetriyas and 11 to Kayasthas, Vaishyas and Punjabis.
    
The Supreme Court in its ruling last week had said religion and caste cannot be used to seek votes and made it clear that religion has no role in the electoral process and that it is just a secular activity."
"Arvind Kejriwal In Punjab's Malwa To Unite Factions, Reach Out To Voters","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-in-punjabs-malwa-to-unite-factions-reach-out-to-voters-1648293","Patiala:                             The Aam Aadmi Party's campaign in Punjab is full swing with party chief Arvind Kejriwal on a 5-day tour of the Malwa region. Despite having a model in next-door Delhi, where the party swept the assembly polls in 2015, the AAP chief his task cut out: In face of severe factionalism, he has to unite the party cadre, hold public meetings with local candidates and reach out to the voters.

The Akali-BJP combine is facing anti-incumbency after two consecutive tenures, and corruption and drug menace are key election issues. In that backdrop, AAP has a clean image and first-time candidates.

Its candidate for Nabha seat, Dev Maan, is the son of a man who owns a small cycle repair shop.
 
The Congress's sitting legislator -- four-time winner Sadho Singh Dharamsood - is carrying out a high-profile campaign with a cavalcade of cars.  

Dev, 44, is on foot. Much like AAP's election model in Delhi, he is going door-to-door. On their lips of his supporters is the party's latest campaign song: ""Ghaaru wala button dabado... Badal ko bhagado (press the button with the broom on it, get rid of the (state's ruling family) the Badals"".

""People are fed up. They have lost hope and want change. We will show them how without money and without bribes, elections can be won,"" said Dev's 80-yr-old father Lal Singh, who earns barely Rs. 4,000 per month.

Battling poverty through the years, the family has managed to send one son abroad. The other, they hope, will change things for the better -- for everyone.

""There are no jobs... I have spent my life with these repair parts, kids have no option but to be drawn to drugs,"" says Lal Singh.

It is people like him who are standing in Arvind Kejriwal's rallies, shouting and cheering, hoping for a change. Mr Kejriwal's Delhi model enthralls them. The Delhi Chief Minister plays along - with his strongest card.

""I am told the Captain (state Congress chief Amarinder Singh, who is from Patiala) hasn't opened a single new school or college in Patiala... AAP in Delhi has advanced government school to the degree that people prefer public over private schools now,"" he says.

While AAP campaign in Delhi was crafted around the educated urban voter, here he has promises for the rural folk. ""We waived off all farmer loans in Delhi. We will do the same for you,"" he adds.  

The Congress is fighting back, tagging Mr Kejriwal an outsider. Some agree.

""I haven't decided, everyone makes promises before elections that are difficult to trust,"" said one of the locals."

The sitting MLA from Margao submitted papers to election officials on the second day of filing nominations. On the first day, no nomination was received.

The former Chief Minister walked to the election office soon after Congress in New Delhi released a list of 27 candidates, which included his name along with those of five other sitting legislators.

""I am not worried. Let there be any number of candidates contesting against me. Margao voters have always given me their support and love,"" Mr Kamat told reporters after coming out of the election office.

Ruling BJP has fielded Sharmad Pai Raiturcar from Margao, the commercial hub of Goa located some 35km from Panaji.

The former Chief Minister had been representing this Assembly segment since 1994 - first on BJP ticket (till 2005) and later as the Congress MLA. He was the Congress Chief Minister between 2007-2012.

The 62-year-old Congress leader said BJP, during its five-year rule, neglected Margao. ""My election plank would be development of the constituency,"" he said."

Chief Minister Harish Rawat, BJP leader Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri, Vijay Bahuguna among others are seeking party tickets for their family members for the february 15 state assembly polls.

The leaders are trying to get tickets for their children even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had exhorted people of the poll-bound states to shun dynastic politics and vote for development.

Interestingly, state Congress chief Kishore Upadhyay, who has a key role in the distribution of party tickets, faces a big test as he himself has been advocating to keep away from from dynastic politics.

The list of those lining up for tickets for their family, mostly sons or daughters, is huge.

Mr Rawat wants to field his two sons, Virendra and Anand, daughter Anupama and his wife Renuka, in this state elections.

According to sources from Congress, Virendra and Anand will be trying their luck from assembly segments in Kumaon region while Anupama and her mother could contest from Haridwar district, a Garhwal division of the state.

Going by the reports, Mr Rawat himself might contest from two assembly seats.

His other relatives, Karan Mehra, Rajya Sabha MP Mahendra Singh Mehra are also aspiring for party tickets.

Apart from them, Mr Rawat's loyalists, including Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal, former MLA from Sult Ranjit Singh Rawat, Lalit Farsvaan from Kapkot, Harish Dhami from Dharchula and Almonda's Manoj Tiwari are vying for ticket to be party's candidate.

State finance minister Indira Hridayesh and Irrigation minister Yashpal Arya also want to field their sons in the elections.

BJP, which claims it is against dynastic politics, is eyeing on Ritu Bhushan, daughter of former chief minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri, to contest from Karnaprayag. Vijay Bahuguna apparently have also asked ticket for his son Saket or Sourav to take on the electoral battle from Sitarganj seat.

BJP's Satpal Maharaj has projected himself from Chaubattakhal while his wife and former forest minister Amrita Rawat has sought ticket from Ramnagar assembly seat."

Union Minister J P Nadda, who is also party's Central Election Committee (CEC) Secretary, told reporters that the names of remaining candidates would be announced later. Five sitting MLAs are among the 17 candidates announced today. BJP has 12 MLAs in the outgoing Assembly.

These six seats include four being represented by ministers in the SAD-BJP coalition government. A couple of them could be dropped as they are over 75 years of age and some others are being seen more vulnerable in an election where the alliance is weathering 10 years of anti-incumbency.

It also fielded Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina for the bypoll to Amritsar Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant following the resignation of Congress leader Amarinder Singh, who had defeated Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2014 polls. Rajesh Hani will contest from Amritsar East, a seat held by Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who along with her husband Navjot Singh Sidhu has quit BJP. She has joined Congress.

The five MLAs in today's list are Dinesh Singh Babbu, Seema Kumari, Ashwani Sharma, K D Bhandari and Sukhjeet Kaur Sahi from Sujanpur, Bhoa, Pathankot, Jalandhar North and Dasuya constituencies respectively.

Some MLAs, who are likely to be dropped, are pitching for family members as party candidates.

The CEC, which included Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah, had met last evening to finalise the names. Sources said there are divergent views in the party over dropping some of the MLAs, causing a delay in the final announcement.

The notification for the state polls, to be held on February 4, was made yesterday and the last date of filing nomination is January 18.

In a strong letter, citing a recent judgement of the Supreme Court, the EC said peace and tranquility during the polls process is ""absolutely essential for free and peaceful conduct of elections in the country.""

""As you are kindly aware the model code of conduct and various provisions of IPC, inter alia, provide that political parties and their leaders should desist from making statements to the effect of creating disharmony between different sections of society on the basis of religion as the same disturb peace and tranquility of the society which is absolutely essential for free and peaceful conduct of elections.

""Even, the apex court of the country has expressed its deep concerns in the matter vide its judgement and order dated January 2, 2017...,"" it said.

""All may please note it and issue suitable advisory to all concerned,"" it added.

In a landmark verdict seeking to separate religion, caste and other issues from politics, the Supreme Court, by a majority verdict, had held as ""corrupt"" the practice of candidates appealing for votes on the basis of these identities included not only him but his agents and voters.

The court held that the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, which say that seeking vote by a candidate in the name of ""his"" religion, caste, race and language in the election law, included candidates, his agents and voters also.

""An appeal in the name of religion, race, caste, community or language is impermissible under the R P Act, 1951 and would constitute a corrupt practice sufficient to annul the election in which such an appeal was made regardless whether the appeal was in the name of the candidate's religion or the religion of the election agent or that of the opponent or that of the voter's,"" the top court order had said.

Between February 4 and March 8, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur are going for Assembly polls and the Model Code of Conduct came into force on January 4 when the EC announced the election schedule."

SP will contest UP election in partnership with Congress
                                Shivpal Yadav, recently deposed as the Samajwadi Party's Uttar Pradesh chief in a bitter power tussle with his nephew and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, has said he will contest next month's assembly elections in the state.

""I will fight the elections,"" Shivpal Yadav told NDTV this morning. The 61-year-old politician's name was added last night to a list of 38 candidates sent by older brother Mulayam Singh to Akhilesh Yadav, who has been recognised by the Election Commission as the Samajwadi Party's chief and has been allotted use of its cycle symbol.

A meeting is being held today at Akhilesh Yadav's 5 Kalidas Marg office in Lucknow to finalise the Samajwadi Party's candidates for UP. It will contest the election in partnership with the Congress, and has offered a little over a 100 of UP's 403 seats for the ally and any others who join them.

Akhilesh Yadav's party will contest about 300 seats and, sources said, the Chief Minister is expected to accommodate all the 38 people recommended by his father; many of the names, they said, overlap with the son's nominees for those seats.

For months, Shivpal Yadav undermined and challenged the Chief Minister's decisions in a family feud that saw Mulayam Singh consistently back his brother against son Akhilesh.  

It resulted in Akhilesh Yadav, 43, overthrowing father and uncle at a party meeting earlier this month, after they released a list of candidates without consulting him. He also challenged them for use of the party name and symbol; the Election Commission said the Chief Minister has proved that he and not his father has the majority support in the Samajwadi Party.

While Akhilesh Yadav has rushed to mend fences with his father, the Election Commission's order has left Shivpal Yadav isolated. Mulayam Singh indicated on Tuesday that he will not launch a new party if his son accommodates his candidates for the UP elections.

In the list of 38 names that he sent to Akhilesh Yadav, Shivpal Yadav's name was initially missing. Mulayam Singh later revised the list, scratching out the name of Shivpal's son Aditya Yadav, to add his for the Jaswantnagar constituency that he represents."

Some four dozen BJP leaders have requested that their relatives be given a chance to contest in Uttar Pradesh, where polls will be held on five days in February and March.

At least 50 sons, daughters and relatives are said to be in the queue, undeterred by PM Modi's strong views. He has often attacked the Samajwadi Party as a ""baap-beta"" or father-son party.

The party is set to announce its first list of 140-odd candidates for the first day of polling on February 4 after a meeting of its Central Election Committee headed by president Amit Shah yesterday. The list is expected to be an indicator of the caste and community spin the BJP will drive in the coming polls.

In the previous polls held in the state - the 2014 national election - the BJP's spectacular haul of 71 of 80 seats was partly credited to the polarization of votes after the riots in Muzaffarnagar.

This time, PM Modi's pro-development pitch will be the main consideration while choosing candidates, the BJP says.

 Party leaders are upbeat about their chances, despite fighting without a chief ministerial candidate and despite facing a tough fight from Mayawati's BSP and even a divided Samajwadi Party.

''The surgical strike and the demonetisation exercise have pushed the PM as the best vote-getter and the public is responding enthusiastically - so much so the party may go past the half-way mark,"" said a UP BJP core committee member.

Expectations of a victory has translated into a race for tickets among the relatives of senior party functionaries.

Home Minister Rajnath singh's son Pankaj tops the list of such aspirants; he reportedly wants to contest from Noida or Sahibabad in Ghaziabad district. Rajnath singh had won the Ghaziabad seat in 2009.

Union Minister Kalraj Mishra's son Amit Mishra has dropped hints that he expects a ticket. His followers have bombarded parts of Lucknow, especially around the BJP state headquarters, with his posters.

Another Lucknow bigwig, Lalji Tandon, was refused the Governor's job in 2014, but his son Ashutosh hopes to make it to an assembly seat.

The BJP's newest members are also not far behind in expecting tickets to contest.

Ex-Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi and former leader of the BSP or Bahujan Samaj Party, Swami Prasad Maurya, are reportedly campaigning for tickets for their relatives. Ms Joshi is said to be trying for her son Mayank's nomination while Mr Maurya reportedly wants son Utkarsha and daughter Sanghmitra both to contest.

Another ex-BSP leader now with BJP, Brajesh Pathak, wants a ticket for his son from Unnao near Kanpur.

Hukum Singh, the controversial BJP lawmaker from Kairana who raised a storm with his claims that Hindus were migrating from the area, wants a ticket for his daughter Mrigyanka Singh.

Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh's son Rajveer Singh, a parliamentarian from Etah, wants his son or wife to reach the state assembly and he is said to be negotiating a deal through his father for at least one ticket in Bulandshahr in western UP.

Devendra Bhole, BJP's sitting MP from Kanpur Dehat, wants a ticket for his son.

Keshav Prasad Maurya has his task cut out. He needs the support of all sitting MPs and leaders during the campaign and can't afford to displease any of them.

The list is long - Moradabad MP Sarvesh Singh, sources say, wants a ticket for his son Sudhansu or wife Sadhna.

BP Mishra, the lawmaker from Banda, is asking for a ticket for nephew Prakash from Karvi, a BSP stronghold. Rekha Verma, the MP from Dhaurehra, reportedly wants a ticket for her niece.

Amroha MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar reportedly wants the Garhmukteshwar assembly seat for his son. Abhishek Pal, the son of Domariaganj MP Jagdambika Pal, is also an aspirant."

"90 Punjabis To Fly To India From Canada To Campaign For AAP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/90-punjabis-to-fly-to-india-from-canada-to-campaign-for-aap-1649099","Toronto:                             Some 90 Punjabis of Indian-origin from Canada will fly to Punjab to campaign for Aam Admi Party (AAP) in 16 of the state's largest constituencies for the assembly elections on February 4.

They will arrive in Punjab on January 19. ""I want to be a part of real change,"" Surinder Mavi, a 31-year-old Brampton resident who helped in organising the plane load of AAP ""election volunteers"" was quoted as saying by Toronto Star.

Mr Mavi said the Toronto area volunteers were part of a campaign that will see thousands of Indian expatriates arrive in Delhi in Punjab to help AAP in the elections, it reported.

Mr Mavi's political awakening began with his arrival in Canada eight years ago, when he realised bribes were unnecessary and basic rules, like stopping at red lights, were respected.

For the election, Mr Mavi will ride an AAP campaign bus that will rally support in 16 of Punjab's largest constituencies.

He had joined the Canadian branch of AAP, which had burst onto the Indian political scene two years ago with a platform of ending the culture of ""bribe-taking,"" the daily reported.

The key platform issues in campaign will be AAP's proposals to fight widespread drug abuse among the youth and programmes to give farmers more money for their crops.

Azad Kaushik, Canadian president of the Overseas Friends of BJP, admitted to ""an anti-incumbency factor"" in Punjab. But he told the Star over phone from Delhi, where he was visiting, that the BJP's economic record would keep its coalition with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in power in Punjab.

Mr Kaushik also accused AAP of having ""failed miserably"" in Delhi, which it governs. ""Polls in the last several months have indicated widely different results. But all show the AAP having a significant impact (in Punjab),"" it reported.

The Punjab election is likely to witness a three-way fight between SAD-BJP, Congress and AAP in all 117 seats."
"Ahead Of Punjab Elections, Navjot Singh Sidhu Joins Congress, Meets Rahul Gandhi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-joins-congress-ahead-of-punjab-elections-1648981","New Delhi: HighlightsNavjot Sidhu's wife said he would be contesting from Amritsar East seat
Election will be held in Punjab on February 4
Mr Sidhu had quit the BJP in September 2016
                                Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu joined the Congress today ahead of assembly elections in Punjab after yet another meeting with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, who welcomed him into the party. The 58-year-old had quit the BJP in September 2016, complaining that he had been sidelined.

Mr Sidhu came on board after lengthy negotiations and several rounds of meetings with Mr Gandhi. His wife Navjot Kaur said he would be contesting from the Amritsar East seat. Sources also said he would get one ticket per family for some of his supporters. As one of the party's star campaigner, he would also address more than 70 rallies.

It was, however, not clear that Mr Sidhu would be offered the post of the deputy Chief Minister, as he had earlier demanded.

Today' meeting with Rahul Gandhi -- the second in four days -- happened at mid-day, during which the Congress vice-president welcomed him into the party. Within minutes, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, ""INC welcomes S.Navjot Singh Sidhu & thanks Rahul Gandhiji for bringing likeminded leaders under the Congress umbrella"".

Later in the afternoon, Mr Sidhu tweeted:
Mr Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur has already been fielded as a candidate, but the constituency is yet to be decided.

Election will be held in Punjab on February 4, in which the Congress, which has been out of power for a decade, has been hoping for big gains. Captain Singh, who is leading the Congress campaign in the state and denied rumours about being unenthusiastic about having Mr Sidhu on board, today said he had spoken to the former cricketer on phone.   

Regarding Mr Sidhu's demand for the post of the deputy Chief Minister, Captain Amarinder Singh, the presumptive Chief Minister, said a decision will be taken by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Mr Gandhi at an ""appropriate time"".

The ruling Akali-BJP combine took potshots at the Congress and Mr Sidhu. Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal asked how he could join a party that ""attacked the Golden Temple"". He also took a dig at Amarinder Singh, tweeting:
Mr Sidhu, who quit the BJP two months ago, had that he had been forced to give up his Amritsar parliamentary seat by the party ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who had lost. Captain Amarinder Singh, who won, has vacated the seat to lead the Congress campaign in the state."
"Punjab Election 2017: Navjot Singh Sidhu And 40 Seats, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi To Decide","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-2017-navjot-singh-sidhu-and-40-seats-congress-vice-president-rahul-gandhi-to-decide-1647097","New Delhi: HighlightsCongress yet to announce candidates for Punjab election
Mr Sidhu wants 4 or 5 seats and also Amritsar parliament seat for himself
Mr Gandhi to hold meeting today to finalise candidates for Congress
                                With Rahul Gandhi back in town after a holiday abroad, the Punjab Congress hopes to wrap up selection of candidates - the party is yet to announce candidates for 40 of the state's 117 seats even a week after assembly elections were announced. Rivals Akali Dal-BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party are well off the mark and campaigning hard.

Mr Gandhi will head a meeting today to finalise candidates for the party, which released its manifesto for Punjab only yesterday. Nominations begin tomorrow and the state will vote on February 4.

The ever changing demands of cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, says sources, are part of the problem. Mr Sidhu, slated to join the Congress for weeks now, reportedly has new terms - he wants a seat to contest not only for himself, but also his wife, who has already joined the party, and other associates. Four or five seats is his latest demand, said sources, and he also wants the Amritsar parliament seat, which he once held as a BJP man, thrown in.   

That puts the Congress in a tight spot - it already has more than two strong claimants for most of the 40 assembly seats for which it is yet to announce candidates and faces rebellion from those who will be left out. In such a situation, five seats for the Sidhu team will be a stretch for the party.

The Congress' offer to Navjot Sidhu so far is the Amritsar East Assembly seat for him to contest and the Deputy Chief Minister's post if the party wins. Mr Sidhu had reportedly agreed to this, paring down an initial demand of 18 seats, but now wants some more.

The Sidhu camp says the current Congress offer barely matches the Aam Aadmi Party offer that he spurned. Arvind Kejriwal's party too had offered to project Mr Sidhu as deputy Chief Minister, like the Congress refusing to field him as presumptive Chief Minister.

Navjot Singh Sidhu quit the BJP last year and has been negotiating with rivals AAP and the Congress since July to setttle on his next political destination."

The Election Commission has ordered that hoardings and photos of PM Modi, Chief Ministers and other political leaders be removed ahead of polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur.

Ads that use public money to project the achievements of political functionaries or political parties are a violation of the model code of conduct, the powerful election body said today.

Instructions have gone to top election officers in the states ""that the photo of political leaders in all hoardings, advertisements that aim to project the achievements of any living political functionaries or political party should be removed or covered.""

The Congress had earlier urged the Election Commission to order the removal of PM Modi's photograph from government posters at public places, including petrol pumps, in the election-bound states. The party objected to the Prime Minister's photo in posters of oil companies put up to popularise a cooking gas scheme.The model code of conduct is in place in the five states, where elections will be held from February 4 to March 8. The votes will be counted on March 11.

In an earlier order, the Election Commission has asked candidates to furnish, if they put up hoardings at private properties, a No Objection Certificate from the owner. The cost of such posters or hoardings would be added to the candidate's expenditure list."
"Arvind Kejriwal To Launch 'Ghar Bachao Muhim' Campaign In Punjab","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-launch-ghar-bachao-muhim-campaign-in-punjab-1647381","Amritsar:                             AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal will be on a two-day visit to the Majha region of Punjab starting January 14 during which he will launch the 'Ghar Bachao Muhim' campaign in the run-up to the upcoming state Assembly polls.

Stating this in Amritsar today, AAP Punjab legal wing head and party candidate from Majitha Himmat Singh Shergill said the Delhi Chief Minister will launch the campaign to encourage the people of Majha to stand united against the ""corrupt"" politicians who ""ruined"" numerous young lives by ""patronising the drug trade"" in the state.

Mr Shergill, who was accompanied by AAP candidate from Amritsar (South) Inderbir Singh Nijjer, said Kejriwal will be in the region from January 14 to 15 during which he will tour the villages of Bhoa, Dinanagar, Dera Baba Nanak, Ajnala, Rajasansi, Attari, Tarn Taran and Khemkaran constituencies falling in the border zone.

He will give a clarion call to the people to fight a ""decisive"" battle against the ""crooked"" politicians for their legitimate rights and betterment of future generations.

Mr Shergill said it was pathetic that Punjabis, who immensely contributed to the national food basket, despite their small geographical area, formed the majority in the army and brought laurels in education and sports, were feeling ""depressed and deserted"" by these ""so-called leaders"" who were busy ""filling their coffers at the cost of Punjab's future"".

Mr Nijjer said Punjabis have always been on the forefront in defending the nation and were acclaimed throughout the world for their exemplary courage, honesty and hard work, but the ""wicked"" politicians have ""wreaked havoc"" on the younger generation by ""exposing them to lethal drugs"".

He asserted that AAP had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" towards drugs and corruption and that those involved in these will be dealt with sternly if the party came to power in Punjab."
"Akhilesh Yadav Has Forged A New Force In Indian Politics","http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/akhilesh-yadav-has-set-a-new-paradigm-for-ups-politics-1647161","Taking a longer view of developments in the Samajwadi Party, it can safely be said that it is immaterial who wins the ""cycle race"", that is, which faction is allotted the bicycle symbol. In fact, so convoluted is the scenario that it is not even certain that there are two clear factions, and it is equally uncertain if the party will split at all. Matters took a comic turn last Monday when the contending groups led by father and son respectively approached the Election Commission with reams of documents to prove their majority within the party and thereby claim their right to the symbol. But by late evening, it was clear that the patriarch, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was keen to pull back from the brink and even the so far belligerent son, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, was not averse to yet another formula to broker peace. ""The Samajwadi Party stands united"" muttered Mulayam Singh while declaring that Akhilesh Yadav would remain the party's electoral face and Chief Ministerial candidate. So many U-turns have been made in the last one month that nothing can be concluded with finality.

But one thing is certain: the SP has already split within, even if it pretends to stay united for public consumption for the time being. It is often assumed that the SP parivaar is basically a drama within the extended Mulayam Singh family, that rival contenders are trying to push one another out in order to take full control over the organization on the eve of the Assembly elections scheduled to be held within the next couple of months. The informal split which has already happened is discernibly one between two generations, with patriarch Mulayam Singh leading the elder and more established leaders (mostly his own relatives), while Akhilesh heads the younger group comprising mostly non-family leaders.

For observers of Indian politics, this is a fascinating scenario. What is playing out is a dramatic generational transition in India's biggest once-Mandalite party. Although Mulayam Singh, along with Lalu Prasad in Bihar, was among the biggest beneficiaries of Mandalism in Indian politics and also an architect of the electorally invincible M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) formula, time has taken a toll on their grasp of Hindi heartland politics. The M-Y alliance helped to thwart the challenge of BJP's mobilization in the name of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Despite the euphoria which brought Kalyan Singh to power in 1991, he could not repeat that performance for the BJP post demolition of the Babri Masjid, and Mulayam was back in the saddle.

Since the 1990s, UP's politics has remained clearly delineated. Over time, the Congress steadily eroded as a mass party, while Mayawati's fledging BSP with its core Dalit support base emerged as a serious contender for power, initially in alliance with the BJP, but eventually on its own steam. Through this, Mulayam Singh's M-Y base was largely undiminished. However the ageing patriarch failed to read the aspirational urges of his own Yadav and remaining OBC communities. Maybe finally recognising the need to make a generational switch, he fielded his son Akhilesh as the party's Chief Ministerial face in 2012 and the energetic new generation leader surprised pundits by leading the SP to a spectacular victory, winning 229 seats in the 405-member UP Assembly in that election.

Akhliesh Yadav dramatically altered his father's style of politics, focusing almost entirely on UP's economic development aimed at consolidating a youth support base that largely cut across caste and community lines. After five years, people in UP recall world-class highways (such as the 393-km-long Agra-Lucknow Expressway built in a record time of 22 months), the recently launched Lucknow-Ballia Expressway, and the Lucknow metro as the dominant symbols of Akhilesh's rule. There is hardly anything by way of infrastructure built by his predecessors that can compare with the breakneck speed with which Akhilesh went about modernizing UP. This was accompanied by a plethora of social sector schemes targeting women and farmers. While such social schemes often flounder on delivery and lead to corruption too, so far the UP Government has managed to implement them with a fair measure of success. The noticeable aspect of Akhilesh's record in office is that no appeal has been made on caste and community lines: He has played primarily on the aspirational urges of the youth, particularly the newly empowered Yadav and OBC youth.

This approach has brought him into conflict with the older generation Yadav leadership in his own party, particularly his uncle Shivpal, who is alleged to operate through a network of local strongmen. Akhilesh may have thus failed to get on top of UP's law and order situation, but few doubt his sincerity to eventually combat such elements.

Thus the division within the Samajwdi Party is not just generational, it is also aspirational. In this the young Samajwadi leader is fighting not only against his own family, most of which is tied to traditional clan-based politics, but is also contesting against the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose policies attract the youth across caste and class.

In many senses, therefore, Akhilesh Yadav is the first mature post-Mandal leader in contemporary politics. Clearly the politics of pure Mandalism has run its course - for the empowerment of the OBCs is now an irreversible reality. Akhilesh is working to construct a post-Mandal base for himself and his party and may well become the example for other similar outfits in North India.

With or without the bicycle symbol and irrespective of whether he leads a united SP to the hustings, Akhilesh Yadav has emerged as UP's pre-eminent next generation politician. Even if he fails to repeat his winning feat of 2012 in the forthcoming Assembly poll, the constituency he is carving out for himself is there to stay. Mayawati's Dalit-dominated party is unlikely to ever gain cross-caste acceptability, although a section of Muslims may vote for her as a tactical ploy to defeat the BJP. In fact, it can be said with some certainty that a paradigm shift has come over UP politics and development has pushed identity politics to the back-burner, even if it takes decades to extinguish it altogether.

And that paradigm shift heralded by Akhilesh Yadav is spelling the doom for backroom cloak-and-dagger politics at which Mulayam Singh's associates excel. Politicians are a canny lot at the worst of times, and so the overwhelming support garnered by Akhilesh within his own party, to the chagrin of leaders like Shivpal Singh, clearly shows which way the wind is blowing. Split or no split, the Samajwadi Party is Akhilesh's for the taking.

"Mulayam Singh And Akhilesh Yadav Meet For 90 Minutes, Fail To Agree","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mulayam-singh-and-akhilesh-yadav-meet-for-90-minutes-fail-to-agree-1647318","Lucknow:                             Warring father-son Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav ended yet another long meeting in Lucknow today without finding common ground. The one-on-one meeting came after Mulayam Singh Yadav seemed to initiate a reconciliation by saying last evening that Akhilesh would be Chief Minister again if the Samajwadi Party wins the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, to be held in multiple phases starting February 11.

The deal-breaker is the position of party president, usurped from his father by Akhilesh Yadav at a party meeting on January 1. Mulayam Singh Yadav asserts he is still party president and wants Akhilesh to give up his claim. Akhilesh, who is backed by a majority leaders and lawmakers in the party, is adamant that he will hold the post for three months and will relinquish it once the UP elections are finished.

Bihar politician Lalu Yadav confirmed that Akhilesh had told him as much when they talked on phone last evening.

The 43-year-old Chief Minister deeply mistrusts his father's closest aides, Mulayam Singh's younger brother Shivpal Yadav and Amar Singh, and wants them kept away from crucial decision-making in this period. His demands - that Shivpal Yadav be removed as the party's UP chief and Amar Singh be sacked - have not been agreed to by Mulayam Singh.      

""Akhilesh will be the Chief Minister after the election, there is no confusion about it,"" said Mulayam Singh on Monday, seen as a significant climbdown. He had earlier said that only he will decide who will be the Chief Minister if the Samajwadi Party is re-elected in UP.

In the power struggle perilously close to the elections, while Akhilesh Yadav has accused Shivpal Yadav and Amar Singh of instigating Mulayam Singh against him, his father's camp has targeted his uncle and staunch supporter Ram Gopal Yadav, accusing him of misguiding Akhilesh.

Ram Gopal has spearheaded Akhilesh's solo campaign, calling the party meeting in which he was declared Samajwadi Party president and also carrying to the Election Commission six boxes of documents to prove that Akhilesh commands the loyalty of a majority in the party and so is the real leader of the Samajwadi Party and must be assigned the party's ""cycle"" symbol to contest the UP elections.

As Mulayam Singh, who too met the Election Commission to stake claim to the party symbol on Monday, declared that there was ""no rift"" with his son, Ram Gopal urged the poll panel to take a quick decision on which faction would get the ""cycle,"" indicating that Team Akhilesh is no mood to bend."

"Congress Beats Akhilesh Yadav To It, Announces Uttar Pradesh Alliance","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadavs-wingman-rahul-gandhi-announcement-likely-tomorrow-1649603","Lucknow: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav says Congress alliance to be announced in ""a day or two""
Akhilesh, Rahul Gandhi expected to hold rallies together in campaign
Akhilesh Yadav yesterday won rights to use party name, symbol
                                Akhilesh Yadav, having set aside his family drama, is moving on to the next order of business ahead of the election: stapling together the alliance that he believes will help him counter rivals Mayawati and the BJP in Uttar Pradesh which begins voting next month. A deal with the Congress will be announced ""in a day or two,"" he told NDTV today. The Congress pre-empted him, declaring the collaboration at a press conference in Delhi today, though it said the details are being finalized. Key among those: how many of the state's 403 seats will be allotted to the Congress and to another potential partner, Ajit Singh's RLD.

Mr Yadav, 43, wants another term as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, but has been preoccupied with a confrontation with his father, Mulayam Singh, whose power play included declaring candidates for the election without inputs from his son.

Yesterday, the issue of who is boss was decided by the Election Commission which ruled that Akhilesh Yadav has the backing of most of the Samajwadi Party and is therefore in control of the legit version of the outfit and not a spin-off as his father had alleged. The victory entitles the young politician to the use of the party symbol of the cycle, easily recognized by voters. Determined to maintain his line of maximum respect for his father, Mr Yadav went to visit him as soon as the case was decided in his favour and then tweeted a photo of them together.

He confirmed today that he is closing a deal with the Congress, which could expand to include smaller regional parties like Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal or RLD. Rahul Gandhi, who is the Vice President of the Congress, has an established political bromance with Akhilesh Yadav. Recently, they flexed their amity if not their vocabulary, with Mr Gandhi terming Mr Yadav ""a good boy"" who shot off the same phrase in return.
 
Mr Yadav had pushed unsuccessfully for his father to agree to a tie-up with the Congress, offering the claim that a partnership could help them get about 300 of the state's 403 seats, largely by consolidating the significant Muslim vote. The alliance is expected to allot about 75-80 seats for Congress candidates. Sources say that Mr Gandhi and Mr Yadav will address rallies together; ditto for Mr Yadav's wife, Dimple, who is a parliamentarian, and Mr Gandhi's sister, Priyanka.

""In our area, in each election, the Congress candidate does manage to get about 5,000 to 10,000 votes, so if both parties were to form an alliance, it would definitely transfer those votes to us and vice versa,"" said Shakeel Ahemd Qureshi, a 66-year-old Samajwadi Party worker from Western Uttar Pradesh.

For the Congress, whose lack of firepower in Uttar Pradesh has been embarrassingly visible, riding piggyback with Mr Yadav offers a chance at some sort of political rejuvenation. As soon as Mr Yadav was declared in custody of the Samjawadi Party yesterday, enthused Congress workers put up posters that were giddy with delight over the alliance that is to follow.

In the alliance that Akhilesh Yadav plans, the Samajwadi Party is likely to contest about 300 of UP's 403 assembly seats, while the Congress could contest about 75, and the RLD and other parties could contest 25-30. It follows the Bihar experiment, where Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was re-elected after strategically partnering with old rival Lalu Yadav's RJD and the Congress.

Elections in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases starting February 11. Votes will be counted on March 11."

There are at least 20 seats where strong ticket contenders have been disappointed giving rise to the possibility that some of them may enter the fray as independents or work to spoil the prospects of the party's official nominees.

While most of the disappointed contenders are yet to disclose their cards, they make no bones about their feeling of being left out.

With Congress turncoat Subodh Uniyal fielded from Narendranagar, BJP's very own Om Gopal Rawat, a former MLA who had consistently nursed the constituency has announced his intention to contest as an independent from the seat.

There is discontent among party leaders in almost all seats from where Congress rebels have been fielded. Former legislator Asha Nautiyal who was expecting a ticket from Kedarnath is unhappy with Congress turncoat Shailarani Rawat fielded from the seat.

Similarly, former MLA Shailendra Singh Rawat is disappointed over Harak Singh Rawat being fielded from Kotdwar.

Former MLA Suresh Chand Jain is sulking in Roorkee from where Pradip Batra has been declared the party's official nominee.

Jain said he feels cheated and will certainly contest for development of the town.

Some of the party's sitting MLAs have also been denied tickets including Yamkeshwar MLA Vijaya Barthwal and Chaubatakhal MLA and former Pradesh BJP president Tirath Singh Rawat.

While Barthwal has been denied a ticket to field former CM and Pauri MP BC Khanduri's daughter Ritu Khanduri, Tirath was ignored to make room for Congress turncoat Amrita Rawat's husband Satpal Maharaj.

Resentment among BJP leaders ahead of assembly polls doesn't augur well for the party with Congress in a mood to lap up disgruntled BJP elements and field them against erstwhile party rebels."
"Shoe Thrown At Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal During Rally In Punjab","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shoe-thrown-at-chief-minister-parkash-singh-badal-during-rally-in-punjab-1647684","Lambi, Muktsar:                             A shoe was thrown at Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal while he was addressing a rally at a village in Lambi this afternoon. The man who threw the shoe is the brother of a Sikh radical leader, police said.

40-year-old Gurbachan Singh threw the shoe towards Mr Badal, which first hit security personnel and then touched 89-year-old Mr Badal's turban, police said.

""A man identified as Gurbachan Singh, a relative of a Sikh radical leader, threw a shoe at Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal,"" Muktsar Senior Superintendent of Police Dhruman H Nimbale said. There was no injury to Mr Badal in this incident, he added.

The police officer said the incident occurred at village Ratta Khera where Mr Badal was busy in a public meeting during his election campaign.

Gurbachan Singh is the brother of radical Sikh leader Amrik Singh Ajnala.

""He appeared to be upset over the sacrilege incidents which took place in Punjab,"" the Senior Superintendent of Police said, adding that he had been arrested.

A case will be registered against the accused, he said.

A few days ago, a group of people threw stones at the cavalcade of deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal at Kandhwala Hazir Khan village in his constituency, Jalalabad in Fazilka district, leaving four Akali supporters injured.

"After Rahul Gandhi's 'Hand' Remark, BJP Guns For Congress Poll Symbol","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/after-rahul-gandhis-hand-remark-bjp-guns-for-congress-poll-symbol-1648784","Lucknow: HighlightsRahul Gandhi violated mode code of conduct, alleges BJP 
Mr Gandhi allegedly correlated the Congress symbol with religious figures
The BJP has sought the withdrawal of the Congress' election symbol
                                The BJP has alleged that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi violated the model code of conduct by ""co-relating the Congress election symbol with religious figures"". The party has filed a complaint with the Chief Electoral Officer of Uttar Pradesh, where elections will take place next month, against the Congress leader. The BJP has also sought the withdrawal of the Congress' election symbol 'hand' and also cancellation of its recognition as a national party.

""Rahul Gandhi, at a convention, named as 'Jan Vedna Sammelan' in Delhi on January 11, 2017, made religious comments by co-relating the symbol of Indian National Congress with religious gods such as Shivji, Guru Nanak, Buddha, Mahavir and Islam, violating the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, MCC and the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court,"" the BJP wrote in its complaint on Friday.

Mr Gandhi had said: ""I found Congress symbol in Shivji, Guru Nanak, Buddha, Mahavir's pictures. I asked Karan Singhji what does it mean? He said (it means) 'don't get afraid.'""

""It's a blatant violation of the model code of conduct and strict action should be taken against Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party for trying to influence voters not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in other poll-bound states, ""said senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav.

Rejecting the allegation, Congress leader PL Punia said, ""What Rahul (Gandhi) said was just a statement to highlight the high recall value and the emotional bond with the Congress symbol. What is so objectionable about that? ""

Demanding the cancellation of the Congress' recognition as a national party, the BJP letter said, ""The Congress party has not disassociated itself from the statements of Shri Rahul Gandhi. Therefore, it has also further violated the Model Code of Conduct.""

""Under Para 16A and 18 of the Election Symbols Order, 1968, and the allotment of hand symbol of Congress party may kindly be withdrawn with immediate effect, along with cancellation of its recognition as a national party,"" the BJP letter read.

Elections will take place in Uttar Pradesh in seven phases from February 11 to March 8."
"Goa Polls: BJP Announces Names Of Candidates For 29 Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/goa-news/goa-polls-bjp-announces-names-of-candidates-for-29-seats-1648107","New Delhi:                             Refraining from projecting Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar as its chief ministerial candidate in the Goa Assembly polls, BJP today announced the names of candidates for 29 seats, including 17 sitting MLAs.

Mr Parsekar figures in the list released by the party in New Delhi today following its Central Election Committee's meeting last evening.

One sitting MLA, Deputy Speaker Vishnu Surya Wagh, who had last year suffered cardiac arrest, has not been fielded on health grounds and is replaced by Ramrao Surya Wagh.

Defence Minister and former Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar will be the key election campaigner for the party in a state where Congress, an alliance of regional outfits, including one headed by a former senior RSS leader, and AAP are other players in the fray.

Mr Parsekar, a Parrikar loyalist, had taken over from him after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted him in his Cabinet as Defence Minister. He, however, continues to have a say in the state's affairs.

Releasing the list, J P Nadda, who is CEC secretary, said the party has given representation to all communities and added that it is considering putting up candidates for all the 40 seats.

The last date of filing nomination, which began yesterday, is January 18.

Asked about its chief ministerial candidate, he said any decision in this regard will be taken by the Parliamentary Board.

He also released the list of three party candidates for biennial election to UP Legislative Council."

The state now has 7.68 crore men, 6.44 crore women and 7,272 transgenders who have their names registered in the voters list, an official said on Friday. This number is 27 lakh more that the previously recorded number of 13.85 crore.

In all, 32.36 lakh names were removed from the voters list -- 14.99 lakh had been removed from the voter list for shifting to other states and 5.53 lakh names were struck off the voters list for being registered at two places, an official told IANS. 

The percentage share of women voters has increased from 58.78 per cent to 60.38 per cent while the gender ratio has increased from 827 to 839.

"Congress Manifesto Offers To End VIP Culture In Punjab","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congress-manifesto-offers-to-end-vip-culture-in-punjab-1646968","New Delhi/Chandigarh:                             The Congress manifesto for the Punjab assembly elections was released today by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh in New Delhi.

"Navjot Sidhu For Congress? Not Quite Yet. 'Stars Do Matter,' Says Wife","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-for-congress-not-quite-yet-astrology-and-clarity-sought-1648454","Amritsar: HighlightsNavjot Singh Sidhu met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi yesterday
Mr Sidhu's wife says he will join unconditionally, but needs clarity
""The stars do matter, waiting for right time"": Sidhu's wife
                                A day after Rahul Gandhi met Navjot Singh Sidhu, the cricket commentator's wife, who is also a politician, has said that the couple ""wants clarity"" on what they are being offered before Mr Sidhu formally joins the Congress. In what seems contradictory to that stand, she then went on to say, ""Our joining the Congress is unconditional.""

The 53-year-old former cricketer quit the BJP in September 2016, after alleging that he had been sidelined by the party, which had forced him to surrender his parliamentary seat of Amritsar for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who lost the constituency in 2014. Two months later, his wife, Navjyot Kaur Sidhu, joined the Congress. Negotiations for how and when Navjot Singh will come on board have been long-running.   

""Yes, we believe a lot in astrology, he will be particular about on what date he joins. Stars do affect you,"" said Navjot Kaur, who in an earlier interview, said her husband and she are ""the same soul n two bodies.""
 Asked about when Navjot Sidhu will join Congress, Mrs Sidhu said, we ""want clarity"" on what's offered
Punjab votes on February 4. The Congress campaign, with Captain Amarinder Singh as presumptive Chief Minister, is in full swing. So is that of Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party, and that of the Badals, who head the incumbent government with the BJP.

Navjot Kaur said today that either her husband or she will run for the Punjab assembly, but it is believed that Mr Sidhu has demanded four to five assembly seats for his associates including his wife, besides the Amritsar parliamentary seat, vacated by Captain Singh.

The Congress is also contending with Mr Siddhu's reported claim for the office of Deputy Chief Minister in case of a Congress victory; Captain Singh has refused to commit to that, stating that a decision would be taken by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Mr Gandhi at an ""appropriate time"".

""We want a clear role in Punjab, we don't want the same insecure relations with Amarinder Singh as had with the Akalis,"" she said, referring to the couple's acrimonious split from their earlier political partners."
"2 Heavyweights, A Small Town - The Biggest Electoral Battle In Punjab","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2-heavyweights-one-small-town-the-biggest-electoral-battle-in-punjab-1648339","Jalalabad, Punjab:                             It is the battle of the heavyweights, the blue ribbon event of the Punjab Assembly Elections. Of the 117 seats, Punjab's biggest electoral battle will be in Jalalabad, a small border town near 300 km from state capital Chandigarh.

No other seat has two opposing stalwarts of this stature. On the one hand there is Sukhbir Badal, the sitting legislator and Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab, on the other, a man who is AAP's star campaigner.

Mr Badal is better known as the son of the five-time Chief Minister of Punjab, Parkash Singh Badal. His challenger is comedian, musician and actor-turned-politician Bhagwant Mann.

Mr Mann showed people don't just come to his rallies for a laugh, when he won the Parliamentary seat from Sangrur in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He is second only to AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal when it comes to crowd pulling.
 
The initial delay in declaring Mr Badal as the Akali candidate triggered suggestions that he wasn't going to take on Mr Mann. As he reached Jalalabad to file his nomination today, he was shown black flags by the local bar association.

The sitting Parliamentarian Sher Singh Ghubaya of the Akali Dal did not accompany him. A few days ago, stones were pelted on Mr Badal's convoy in the area.

Yesterday, Mr Badal's wife, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, had suggested that if Parkash Singh Badal called for violence, AAP workers wouldn't survive. This was in the context of a shoe attack on the Chief Minister. The Akalis allege the man was connected to AAP.

Today, Sukhbir Badal reiterated what sounded like a warning and stopped short of an all-out threat.

""Our workers are quiet because we believe in law and order... this is all planned by AAP, including the incident with Parkash Badal. The previous incidents have been orchestrated by AAP and Bhagwant Mann has incited the violence,"" he said.

Addressing a few hundred people at a rally, Mr Mann retorted: ""The elder Badal says Bhagwant Mann is inciting people and is behind the shoe throwing attack and the pelting of stones on Sukhbir Badal. I am against these kind of acts. No place for them in democracy.''

Gurpreet Sandhu, spokesperson of a breakaway group from AAP, which calls itself APP (Apna Punjab Party) suggest they will be the key to this elections -- indicating a hung assembly could be the result.

Even they call Jalalabad the 'hot seat'.

The battle could get even more interesting because Sher Singh Ghubaya's son, who did not get a seat, has joined the Congress Mr Ghubaya commands great influence is the area as a Rai Sikh - a community that constitutes 35 per cent of the Jalalabad vote."
"UP Elections 2017: BJP Announces List Of 149 Candidates","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjp-announces-list-of-149-candidates-1649473","New Delhi:                             The BJP announced a list of 149 candidates for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, to be held in seven phases between February 11 and March 8. Most of the candidates announced today will contest the polls in the first two phases on February 11 and 15. The party's Central Election Committee met last night to finalise the candidates. It will meet again, tomorrow, to discuss other prospective candidates for the polls.

Among the candidates released by the party, former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Vajpayee will seek to retain the Meerut constituency whereas Sandeep Singh, grandson of former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, will contest the poll in Atrauli. The party also announced its national secretary Shrikant Sharma as their candidate in Mathura.

The party has also retained incumbent legislators Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana, both accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots.

The list was released by Union Health Minister J P Nadda, who said that the party has accommodated various sections of the society.The list, interestingly, did not feature the name of Pankaj Singh - son of Union Home Minister and former Chief Minister Rajnath Singh - who is widely speculated to contest the UP polls.

According to news agency PTI, despite the entry of many state leaders from other parties into the BJP, former BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya is unhappy with the leadership over the choice of contestants.

The BJP has been out of power in the state of Uttar Pradesh since 2002. It seeks to regain power in the state, which gave them 71 seats in the 2014 Union elections.

"Manohar Parrikar For Goa Chief Minister Again? The BJP Doesn't Say No","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manohar-parrikar-for-goa-chief-minister-again-the-bjp-doesnt-say-no-1648649","Panaji: HighlightsManohar Parrikar remains the face of the party in Goa, says BJP
Goa goes into polls for a new government on February 4
Laxmikant Parsekar succeeded Manohar Parrikar as chief minister in 2014
                                The BJP does not rule out the return of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar as Goa chief minister, with senior party sources saying today that all ""doors are open."" Mr Parrikar, they said, remains the face of the party, which he led to victory in the state in the last assembly elections. Goa will vote for a new government on February 4 and votes will be counted on March 11 along with four other states.

""Let us cross the bridge when it comes. (Nitin) Gadkariji has said what we wanted to say,"" said Mr Parrikar in capital Panaji today, on intense speculation after union minister Nitin Gadkari said yesterday that the next Goa chief minister ""can either be from the elected representatives or we can even send (someone) from the Centre,"" if the BJP retains the state.

Manohar Parrikar, 61, had been Chief Minister for a little over two years in his third stint in that post, when he was pulled out of Goa in late 2014 to join Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet as Defence Minister, replacing Arun Jaitley, who had held additional charge of the crucial ministry for several months.

In his state, Mr Parrikar remains the BJP's tallest leader and its most popular face. Laxmikant  Parsekar, who succeeded him as Chief Minister was handpicked by Mr Parrikar to take his place when he moved to Delhi. Mr Parrikar is often referred to as the ""super Chief Minister"" in Goa.

The Defence Minister has made frequent trips to Goa in recent weeks to campaign and plan the party's strategy and, sources said, he is expected to spend about 20 to 25 days off and on in the state till the elections.

By projecting Mr Parrikar, the BJP hopes to consolidate its voters in what is seen as a tough fight for the ruling party to retain a majority.

Regional party and ally Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP parted ways with the BJP last week. The MGP, which had contested the last Goa elections as a pre-poll partner of the BJP, has said it plans to field candidates in about 22 seats and is expected to cut into the BJP's votes.

Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party too is contesting the Goa elections for the first time this year and has named a former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate. The Congress is yet to decide whether it will tie up with other parties or fight the Goa elections alone."

"MCD Election 2017: Congress, Twice Zero, Eyes AAP Voters in Delhi Civic Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/congress-twice-zero-eyes-aaps-urban-poor-voters-in-delhi-civic-polls-1682495","New Delhi:                             It has won zero seats in the last two elections held in Delhi, but the Congress is pinning its hopes on a fading out of the Aam Aadmi Party and annexing some of the massive vote share Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had won in the 2015 assembly elections to sweep the capital.

The Congress released the first part of its manifesto - there are three parts - for Delhi today targeting the urban poor who live in massive slums and unauthorised colonies across the capital and who gave Mr Kejriwal 60 per cent of his vote share two years ago.

""The upcoming Delhi civic body polls will be a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP. There is no third party in the contest,"" said Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken as he released the manifesto, calling Delhi's urban poor the most neglected segment in the capital. The Congress has promised that if it wins the three municipal corporations in Delhi, it will set aside 2,000 crores for the re-settlement of those who live in unauthorised colonies.

The party has also promised that Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD sanitation employees, currently on contract, will be given permanent jobs. And those 5 lakh street vendors will be given licences. The party also plans a scheme to bring drop-outs from MCD-run schools back into the education system.

In an important promise, the Congress has taken up complete elimination of land fill sites for better sanitation. The next two tranches of promises will focus on infrastructure and the youth.

The Congress has released its manifesto a day after the BJP did. The Aam Aadmi Party plans to release its manifesto tomorrow.

Elections to the MCD, now split into three - MCD North, MCD South and MCD East - will be held on Sunday, April 23, and votes will be counted on Wednesday, April 26. Delhi's civic body has been dominated by the BJP for 10 years now. In 2012, the first election after the MCD was divided into three, the BJP won a majority in the north and east and was the largest party in MCD south. The Congress had trailed in second place in all three. The Aam Aadmi Party did not contest that election - it was launched later that year.

While the BJP has pulled out all stops to retain control with a keenly devised strategy and high powered campaign, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP is seen as fighting to retain political relevance after being trounced in the Punjab and Goa elections this year.

The Congress' recent record in Delhi hasn't been great. In the assembly elections two years ago, AAP swept it aside winning 67 of 70 seats. The BJP won the other three. In the national election in 2014, the BJP took all seven Delhi seats in a Modi wave."
"MCD Elections 2017: Need VVPAT To Keep Tab On Civic Poll Results, AAP Tells Court","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/mcd-elections-2017-need-vvpat-to-keep-tab-on-civic-poll-results-aap-tells-court-1682736","New Delhi:                             The use of VVPAT or Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail machines should be allowed along with the Electronic Voting Machines during the upcoming civic polls in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party requested the Delhi High Court today. The appeal comes amid the huge controversy over the use of EVMs. Opposition parties, including AAP, contend that EVMS were tampered with in the recently held assembly elections and demand that the Election Commission reverts to the use of old-style ballot papers.

In absence of ballot papers, slips from VVPAT machines should be used to double check on the announced results, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has said.  This, he has said, is the easiest thing the Commission can do to win back people's faith.

AAP had already moved a request letter regarding this to the Election Commission. But in absence of a response even a week before elections, the party said it wants the court to intervene.

VVPAT machines dispense a paper slip that helps voters verify if their vote has been correctly recorded by the EVM.

The Election Commission, which has backed the EVMs through the controversy, has issued a challenge to non-believers to try and tamper with the machines. Mr Kejriwal, who has an engineering background, has said he can think of 10 ways in which the machines can be hacked.

The complaints against the EVMs started after a controversial demonstration of a machine Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district, which was allegedly used in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Pointing to the video demonstration by an election official, the opposition parties claimed it shows EVMs were tampered to favour the BJP.

The Election Commission had said the machine in question was an unused VVPAT machine that was kept in reserve during the elections in Uttar Pradesh. The Commission has also pointed out that the 45-day cooling off period necessary for an EVM is not essential for a VVPAT machine."
"By-Election Result 2017:  In Madhya Pradesh By-Polls, BJP And Congress Retain Seats They Held","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/by-election-result-2017-bjp-holds-fort-in-madhya-pradesh-wins-bandhavgarh-set-to-win-ater-1680969","Bhopal:                             The BJP and the Congress split Madhya Pradesh's two seats where by-elections were held, retaining seats they had held. The by-polls were watched closely as a bellwether for assembly elections next year.

In Bandhavgarh, the BJP's Shivnarayan Singh defeated the Congress candidate Savitri Singh by more than 25,476 votes. By-elections were held because the sitting BJP legislator was elected to parliament in a by-poll last year.

The by-poll in Ater has been won by the Congress' Hemant Katare, whose father Satyadev Katare was the Congress' legislator from the seat and had died recently. The party had fielded the MLA's son hoping to cash in on a sympathy wave, but Mr Katare almost didn't make it, trailing behind the BJP's Arvind Singh Bhadoria in the first few rounds and finally winning only by 857 votes.

The Congress had demanded that voting in the Madhya Pradesh by-elections be done on ballot paper and not electronic voting machines or EVMs, after a voting machine reportedly issued only BJP slips during a demonstration in Bhind, where the Ater constituency is. The Election Commission has emphatically said that EVMs cannot be rigged, rejecting the demand for paper ballot.

The last-minute win in Madhya Pradesh improved the Congress' tally from today's by-elections. For most of the day it had seemed set to retain only two seats in Karnataka. The party has lost state after state in assembly elections since its debacle in the 2014 national elections and hopes to benefit from a possible anti-incumbency sentiment in next year's election in Madhya Pradesh, which has been ruled by the BJP for many years.

The BJP has ruled the state since 2003, with Chief Minister Chouhan following up a big win in the 2013 assembly elections with almost a clean sweep of the state in the 2014 national election. The BJP had won 27 of 29 Lok Sabha seats.

In the 230-member state assembly, it holds 166 seats."

Speaking at a programme in Haridwar yesterday, Ms Hridayesh, who was made the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly recently, said, ""Rawat should take the responsiblity for the party's drubbing as the electoral battle was fought under his leadership.""

She said Mr Rawat himself losing both the seats he had contested was a ""dark chapter of politics"".

Apparently hurt by Ms Hridayesh's outburst, Mr Rawat issued a statement through his former media advisor Surendra Kumar, and said that he had already publicly owned up responsibility for the the Congress's defeat and he is ready to offer himself if party leaders feel he deserves some punishment.

""I have already owned up responsibility for the party's defeat publicly immediately after the polls. Still, if PCC president Kishore Upadhyay and the Leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh want to subject me to some punishment, I readily offer myself,"" Rawat said in the statement.

The Congress was decimated in the recent assembly elections in Uttarakhand as well as the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. In Uttarakhand, the party won 11 out of the total 70 constituencies."
"Gujarat Elections 2017: Congress Leaders Eyeing Chief Minister Position Meet Ahmed Patel","http://www.ndtv.com/ahmedabad-news/gujarat-elections-2017-congress-leaders-eyeing-chief-minister-position-meet-ahmed-patel-1684709","Ahmedabad:                             A couple of Congress leaders in Gujarat, who are vying to become the party's chief ministerial face in the upcoming assembly polls, recently held separate meetings with senior party leader Ahmed Patel.

Mr Patel was recently on a four-day visit to Gujarat and mainly stayed in his hometown Bharuch, where the leader of opposition Shankarsinh Vaghela and party's state unit chief Bharatsinh Solanki, who are currently in the race to become Congress' Chief Minister candidate for the state assembly elections, met him separately.

Several legislators, including Paresh Dhanani, also met Mr Patel to present their side.

Ahead of Mr Patel's visit, a meeting was held on April 17 at Mr Vaghela's residence in Gandhinagar, which was attended by 36 MLAs (out of the total 54 MLAs in the state assembly). Gujarat Congress in-charge Gurudas Kamat was also present there.

During that meeting, the legislators demanded that Mr Vaghela should be made the Chief Minister candidate. They said in case the party decides not to declare a Chief Minister face in the state, Vaghela should be given a ""free hand"" for the elections and he should be made the poll committee in-charge.

Ahmed Patel visited Gujarat a day after the MLAs' meeting at Mr Vaghela's place. According to party sources, some of the legislators, who chose not to attend the previous meeting, met Mr Patel under the leadership of Amreli legislator Paresh Dhanani and opposed making Mr Vaghela as the party's Chief Minister face or the election committee in-charge of the state.

""While Solanki met Patel in Bharuch on Thursday and gave a detailed representation from his side, Vaghela met him yesterday and discussed about the political situation related to the upcoming elections,"" sources added.

Mr Patel told them that a final decision on whether to declare a Chief Minister candidate in Gujarat or not rests with the party high command. Mr Patel left Gujarat yesterday.

State party spokesperson Manish Doshi said, ""Patel is a senior leader of Congress and it is natural for the state leaders to visit him if he is in Gujarat. There is nothing unusual in it,"" he said.

According to Mr Doshi, the discussion between party's state unit president and Patel included a range of issues like political situation in the state and upcoming visit of national vice-president Rahul Gandhi on May 1.

Meanwhile, Gurudas Kamat had yesterday tweeted, ""Met Rahulji (Gandhi) and had a detailed discussion with him over his upcoming rally in Gujarat on May 1 to address a tribal rally.""

Mr Doshi said that the Congress vice president will address a rally at Dediyapada in Bharuch district on May 1."
"Mock Away, Won't End Campaign Against EVMs (Vote Machines): Team Kejriwal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mock-away-wont-end-campaign-against-evms-vote-machines-team-kejriwal-1686147","New Delhi: HighlightsAAP blamed its loss in the civic elections on EVM tampering
'This isn't Modi wave, this is an EVM wave,' said senior leader Gopal Rai
'If EVMs are faulty, how did Kejriwal win Delhi,' asked Amit Shah
                                The campaign against the Electronic Voting Machines or EVMs will continue, no matter what anyone says, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party declared today in face of BJP jibes. The ruling party of Delhi, which made its debut in the civic elections two years after its massive sweep in Assembly polls, came a poor second.

As the trends made the extent of its losses clear, Chief Minister Kejriwal's deputy Manish Sisodia said, ""EVM tampering is the bitter truth of the country's democracy. One can crack jokes on us initially, but fearing being made fun of, we cannot refrain from speaking the truth"".

Following a huddle Mr Kejriwal's residence, the party blamed the loss on what it called an ""EVM wave"" -- an allegation levelled by some parties in the aftermath of the recent round of assembly elections. Delhi minister and senior party leader Gopal Rai said, ""This isn't a Modi wave, this is an EVM wave. The same happened in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand"".

A number of BJP leaders reacted with derision. ""If they stay in the same mode (of blaming EVMs) no one can save them,"" said Vijay Goel. ""If there was EVM tampering, it would have happened in Punjab too,"" pointed out Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.

Party chief Amit Shah weighed in, saying Mr Kejriwal won the 2015 assembly elections on the same EVMs. The UPA 1 and UPA 2 also came to power on those very machines. ""If EVMs are faulty, how did they manage to win? I think everyone should respectfully accept the electorate's decision,"" he said.

But AAP refused to back down. ""I want to ask GVL (Narasimha Rao) why he has written a book on EVMs and said we should adopt ballot boxes,"" retorted party leader Ashutosh. Earlier today, BJP spokesperson Mr Rao had coined a new definition of AAP, tweeting it was ""Absolute Arrogance Personified"".

Mr Sisodia questioned how the BJP, which ""brought an entire research paper, books on EVM tampering"" can say EVMs cannot be tampered."
"Enforcement Directorate Giving Out 'Concocted' Value Of Assets Seized: Virbhadra Singh","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/enforcement-directorate-giving-out-concocted-value-of-assets-seized-virbhadra-singh-1677408","New Delhi:                             Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh today accused the Enforcement Directorate of ""concealing"" facts and giving out a ""concocted"" value of the assets seized by the agency in connection with its money laundering probe against him and others.

""While one expected political opponents to distort facts to drive political mileage, it is a matter of grave concern that a responsible government agency is behaving in such a manner and spreading a canard against me,"" he claimed in a statement.

Mr Singh's reaction came in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attaching a farmhouse in New Delhi having a market value of Rs. 27 crore.

The agency alleged the property in the upmarket south Delhi area of Dera Mandi near Mehrauli was purchased ""out of laundered money through shell firms"".

It indicated that the funds were paid as quid pro quo by the director of a Delhi-based firm for establishing a hydro power plant in Himachal Pradesh's Chamba district.

 Mr Singh said that the Centre had been using its full might to harass and destablise a duly elected government in Himachal Pradesh and ""the ED and CBI were being misused to probe bogus charges against him, even though nothing incriminating had been found so far.""

He also accused the Deputy Director of Income Tax, Faridabad for creating ""baseless and fictitious survey reports and dossiers under instructions from the IT department, Chandigarh.""

""The farmland in question was purchased for only Rs. 1.20 crore by the company Ms Mapple, promoted by my son Vikrmaditya,"" the Congress leader said, adding that he gave Rs. 90 lakh to his son from his personal account through proper banking channels, and the remaining amount was paid from his personal accrued money.

""My family took friendly loans amounting to Rs. 5.90 crore from V Chandersekhar and the amount had been paid back in full with interest long time back and accounted for tax appropriately. It is on record that the said property was purchased for Rs. 1.20 crore, but the ED gave its value at Rs. 27 crore,"" the statement said.

The Chief Minister also alleged that an officer, whose wife is a BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh, was assigned the duty of assessing Maple as Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi. He said that the officer instead of assessing the revenue, made ""malafide conclusions that the property was worth Rs. 27 crore.""

""Now the ED was using the baseless revenue assessment figure of Rs. 27 crore to sensatonalise the matter to malign and defame him,"" he further alleged.

""All this was a matter of record yet my family members have been harassed and persecuted using multiple central agencies since 2013,"" he said.

Mr Singh added that he would take appropriate legal remedies to contest all charges and not only come out clean but also politically victorious.

The Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections are scheduled later this year."
"EVM Tampering: New Voting Machines Won't Work If Tinkered With","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/new-evm-will-stop-working-if-tampered-with-1676469","New Delhi:                             The Election Commission is set to buy next generation electronic voting machines or EVMs that become ""inoperable"" the moment attempts are made to tinker with it, a move which comes amid claims by some parties that the machines were tampered with during the recent assembly polls.

The 'M3'-type EVMs are also equipped with a self-diagnostic system for authentication of genuineness of the machines.

These will come with a public key interface-based mutual authentication system.

Only a ""genuine"" EVM -- manufactured either by atomic energy PSU ECIL or defence PSU BEL -- ""communicates"" with other EVMs in the field.

Any EVM manufactured by other companies would not be able to communicate with other machines, thus exposing it.

Around Rs. 1,940 crore (excluding freight and taxes) will be required to procure the new machines which are likely to be introduced by 2018, a year before when the next Lok Sabha elections are due, the Law Ministry has said, quoting details made available by the Election Commission to be given to Parliament.

The Election Commission has decided to replace 9,30,430 EVMs purchased before 2006 as the older machines are nearing their 15-year life cycle, he said.

On December 7 last, the Union Cabinet had approved a fresh tranche of Rs. 1,009 crore for the Election Commission to buy new EVMs so that it can phase out the ageing ones before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Cabinet had also authorised the Election Commission to vary the quantity to be ordered on BEL and ECIL based on their production capacity and past performance.

On July 20 last, a similar Election Commission proposal to buy nearly 14 lakh new EVMs -- the first tranche -- at a cost of Rs. 9,200 crore during 2016-17 was approved by the Union Cabinet.

In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, the Law Ministry had said that EC has not purchased a single new machine in the last three fiscals.

Minister of State for Law P P Chaudhary had said that the poll panel has informed the government that it had not procured any electronic voting machine during 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17."
"We Are Capable On Our Own: Mulayam Singh Dismisses Son Akhilesh Yadav's Alliance Talk","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mayawati-capable-on-her-own-mulayam-singh-dismisses-sons-alliance-talk-1682117","New Delhi:                             The friction between Mulayam Singh and his son Akhilesh -- buried in the aftermath of the Samajwadi Party's drubbing in the recent assembly elections - has come to the fore again over the suggestion of yet another alliance. On Sunday, the party veteran dismissed the suggestion that arch rival and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati and his party can work together. ""We are capable on our own,"" was the terse response from the Yadav Senior when asked to comment on talks of a grand alliance against the BJP for 2019.

In the process, he contradicted what his son Akhilesh Yadav said barely 24 hours ago.

""There should be a grand alliance. We are in favour of it,"" Mulayam's son and the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had said on Saturday, barely 24 hours after Mayawati said her Bahujan Samaj Patry was ready to work with like-minded parties ""to save democracy"".

The BSP, she said, had no reservations in taking the help of anti-BJP parties in its fight against EVM tampering and the BJP. ""It is democracy which comes first... we have to keep democracy alive,"" she told her party workers in Lucknow on Friday.

The Congress -- which partnered the Samajwadi Party ahead of the elections and had been the cause of another flashpoint in the Yadav family -- offered to mediate. ""Congress would act as a bridge for SP and BSP,"" senior party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar said. ""We have two years before the elections, we can make this alliance a great alliance,"" he said.

A grand alliance had succeeded in Bihar but will it work nationally?

The Left Front said there is a need to make common cause over people's issues. ""There is a possibility of stopping the BJP. And to stop them, there is need for the broadest possible people's action for which all should come together,"" asserted CPI leader D Raja, who, in recent times, has met Akhilesh Yadav, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

Mr Raja admits that in many states ""potential national allies"" are bitter rivals in state. ""There are difficulties in certain states like West Bengal or Tripura. But each party will have to do their own assessment and our assessments may even converge,"" Mr Raja told NDTV. In Bengal and Tripura, the Left is bitterly opposed to Trinamool while in Kerala, Congress is the Left's main electoral rival.

The BJP calls the idea of a grand alliance a non-starter. ""Whether Akhilesh forms alliance or a grand alliance, he won't be able to stop the BJP. People of the nation are with Prime Minister Modi and they want development,"" said Keshav Prasad Maurya, the deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh."
"Will Start Campaign To Unite 'Samajwadis': Shivpal Singh Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/will-start-campaign-to-unite-samajwadis-shivpal-singh-yadav-1677380","Lucknow:                             In a new twist to the feud within the Samajwadi Party, its leader Shivpal Singh Yadav today said he will soon launch a campaign to unite ""samajwadis"" (socialists) to bring them on one platform.

Shivpal, the warring uncle of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, had threatened to launch a new party after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

""We will not let the legacy of 'samajwad' (socialism) to weaken and will soon launch a campaign to unite socialists to bring them on one platform,"" he said here while felicitating Sayed Sagir Ahmad, a senior socialist leader.

""The fight for social justice will be fought with full strength. In the name of Rama, politics of social justice should be done and not of hatred,"" Shivpal said.

After filing his nomination for state polls on January, he had said he would form a new party after the election results are declared. But, subsequently he had said there was no such move.

With Akhilesh snubbing Shivpal and naming Ram Govid Chowdhury the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly and Mulayam Singh Yadav giving the Samajwadi Party's national executive meeting a miss, any patch-up seems unlikely.

In a public outburst against his son, Mulayam on Saturday had said Akhilesh had insulted him and the voters understood that ""one who is not loyal to his father, cannot be loyal to anyone"" which led to the party's poll debacle.

The SP got only 47 seats in the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly, its lowest tally since the party's inception in 1992.

Following a bitter feud between the father and the son, Akhilesh had snatched reins of the party from Mulayam Singh and their fight also reached the Election Commission.

Mulayam, who has since been given the role of party mentor, had openly criticised the Samajwadi-Congress alliance and was virtually absent from the campaign too."

But sources said the chief of the Janata Dal United, Congress's senior partner in the three-party Grand Alliance that kept the BJP at bay in Bihar, has been scouting for allies for a nationwide 'Mahagathbandhan"" to beat them in the 2019 general elections.

The Congress had fallen back on its staple ""introspection"" after the drubbing by the BJP. Sources said Mr Kumar's suggestion to Mrs Gandhi was on the lines of the advice he had given to her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi. ""Instead of reacting to Narendra Modi, we should be setting our own agenda,"" he was quoted as telling her.

Ahead of the latest round of assembly elections, Mrs Gandhi had been away from the public eye, Rahul Gandhi was on the drivers' seat. She had not even campaigned in the family turf of Amethi and Raebareli  -- where the party had managed to win only two of the 10 seats. Her last public appearance was during a rally in Varanasi, when she was taken ill mid-way and had to be brought back to Delhi. Her medical condition has not been revealed by the party.

Today, the two leaders also discussed a joint candidate for the post of the President - Pranab Mukherjee's tenure ends in July. ""Sonia Gandhi being the leader of the largest opposition party should take the lead,"" said JD(U) leader KC Tyagi. Mr Kumar, he said, has already taken up the matter with leaders of the Left parties and received a good response.

There has been speculation that Mr Kumar was considering an alliance with the BJP, fueled by his invitation to BJP leaders for Makar Sankranti feast, his party's deteriorating relation with Lalu Yadav's RJD and the BJP's sweeping victory in Uttar Pradesh. But Congress sources said that Mr Kumar was organising Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran Centenary visit in a grand scale was enough to dispel the impression."
"Performance Review On Agenda As PM Narendra Modi Meets Ministers Today","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/performance-review-on-agenda-as-pm-narendra-modi-meets-ministers-today-1680465","New Delhi:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his cabinet ministers at 3 pm today and this will be followed by a meeting with his entire council of ministers at 4.30 pm. The Prime Minister holds these meetings on the third Wednesday of every month, but could not do so for the last two months because of hectic campaigning that leaders were involved in for the assembly elections in five states.

The Modi government finishes three years next month and ministers are expected to be asked today to list achievements in their departments. A few of them could also make presentations, sources said.

Cabinet ministers have already been asked to list five achievements each in their ministries that have benefited people, including key reforms. They have also been asked to provide data that shows the progress made since the BJP-led government came to power.

Last week, Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu sent a letter to all the ministers explaining that these inputs would be included in a booklet that the government plans to publish before May 26, the day PM Modi took oath three years ago.

The ministers have been asked to make three-page submissions that must be in bullet points only and must list the key performance indicators or KPIs of the department.

Some ministers have been asked to prepare notes on specific sectors. Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar has been asked to write one on the highlights of PM's tours abroad and on increased investment flow from foreign countries.

Earlier this week, the Prime Minister also met over dinner, leaders of 32 parties that are the BJP's allies in the National Democratic Alliance or NDA that it leads over dinner. The allies endorsed the centre's policies and vowed to work together to win a second term under PM Modi's leadership in 2019, union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after the meeting."
"Amit Shah To Campaign For BJP, Visit All States By September","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-campaign-for-bjp-visit-all-states-by-september-1685971","New Delhi:                             BJP chief Amit Shah will visit all states by September-end as part of his campaign to strengthen the party as it readies for another round of assembly polls and the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

He will spend 95 days, as announced by him in the recent national executive in Bhubaneswar, during the drive, which starts from Jammu and Kashmir. He will spend two to three days in each of the states and union territories.

This programme is different from his 15-day tour of five states, which started today with a three-day stay in West Bengal, as the BJP aims at toning up the organisational structure and will not involve much public contact.

""This is for the first time that the president of a party as big as the BJP will be touring all states of the country to strengthen the organisation. We want to make the birth centenary year of Deen Dayal Upadhyay a memorable period in our history,"" party general secretary Arun Singh said.

Deen Dayal Upadhyay is one of the two ideological stalwarts, the other being Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. It has launched a series of nation-wide activities from September 25, 1916 to observe his birth centenary year.

The entire exercise underlines Mr Shah's ambitious plans to increase the party's footprints across the country, especially in electorally important states where it has always been a
fringe player, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

He is especially focusing on Odisha, West Bengal, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and Telangana, which together send 141 MPs to the Lok Sabha of 543 members, excluding two
nominated members. 

Despite notching up an unprecedented majority in 2014 Lok Sabha polls by winning 282 seats, the BJP could win only five seats in these states.

As it will likely find it a difficult task to repeat its massive sweep of the west India and states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Shah wants it to win more seats in these six states to make up for any fall in its tally in other states."
"EVM In Madhya Pradesh Votes Just For BJP, Says Opposition Seeking Probe","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/evm-in-madhya-pradesh-votes-just-for-bjp-says-opposition-seeking-probe-1676116","Bhopal: HighlightsEVM allegedly produces slips for BJP no matter which button pressed 
Local election officer rejects charges, poll commission seeks report
Opposition brings back allegations of EVM tampering in last elections
                                An Electronic Voting Machine that was reported to have voted for a particular party during a demonstration in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday reignited the opposition charge that tampered EVMs had helped the BJP in the last round of assembly elections.

The Election Commission of India has sought a detailed report from Bhind's District Election Officer after seeing the video of a demonstration organised by state election officials for journalists ahead of by-elections in the state's two assembly seats. It has also sent a high-level team to the state to investigate.

Chief Electoral Officer Shalina Singh later told reporters that they wanted to show how the VVPAT - Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail - would let voters know if the machine voted for the different candidate than the one selected by the candidate. She also rejected claims that the machine voted for the BJP on both occasions.

But the opposition that has been raising questions on the EVMs weren't clearly satisfied.

VVPAT is a machine which dispenses a slip with the party's symbol for which a person has voted for. The slip is visible for seven seconds before it drops in a box.

The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party rushed to the Election Commission's in Delhi, tasking the party's senior leaders to reiterate their concerns with the poll panel that has, in the past, dismissed questions about the neutrality of the machine.

BSP chief Mayawati was the first to question the EVMs after the BJP's massive win in the assembly elections that installed Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. Other opposition parties soon joined in, right from AAP's Arvind Kejriwal who had hoped to come to power in Punjab and the Samajwadi Party that was reduced to double digits in the country's most populous state to the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.

Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said the doubts raised on the EVMs must be investigated. Mr Scindia, who along with party general secretary Digvijaya Singh had approached the panel, said the EC had assured they would take steps.

The Congress general secretary said EVMs should not be used for elections. ""From Advani to Mayawati to Kejriwal, I stand with them on this,"" Mr Singh, otherwise a bitter critic of Mr Kejriwal, said. BJP veteran LK Advani had raised doubts about the possibility of EVMs malfunctioning after the 2009 elections.

Mr Kejriwal too landed at the commission soon after. The Madhya Pradesh example, where the machine allegedly voted for the BJP irrespective of the candidate selected, was another such example where machines only voted for one party. ""If it was because of a fault, why is it that the faulty machines only vote for BJP... why not the Congress or the Samajwadi Party,"" he asked."
"Arvind Kejriwal: As IIT Engineer, Can Share 10 Ways To Rig EVMs","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/this-is-not-a-trailer-arvind-kejriwal-to-ndtv-on-delhi-no-3-result-1681514","New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal's AAP placed third in Delhi by-election
Delhi's local elections coming up later this month
This result not an indicator of how AAP will perform in those, he says
                                Despite bombing in a by-election in Delhi this week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today told NDTV that the people of Delhi are happy with his government. Mr Kejriwal insisted that his Aam Aadmi Party or AAP had foreseen its loss in the election for an assembly seat, but was ""unable to share its message effectively.""

Yesterday, AAP was such a poor third in the by-election that its candidate lost his deposit. The BJP won the seat, the Congress was runner-up. AAP's result was used by both parties to predict a crash-and-burn outcome for Mr Kejriwal in the municipal elections in the capital scheduled for the 23rd. ""This is not a trailer,"" said Mr Kejriwal, referring to the by-election and claiming that AAP was punished because people were upset that the legislator in the constituency that voted, Rajouri Garden, had been moved to contest the recent election in Punjab.

The local elections on the 23rd will measure his popularity mid-way through his term. In 2015, AAP, a political novice, pulled off a win of startling proportion, losing just three seats in Delhi. Of late, the party has been bruised by its inability to win Punjab, where Mr Kejriwal led an extensive campaign, and by a series of indictments for allegedly going rogue on basic guidelines and processes required of the government. Mr Kejriwal has pointed out that the verdicts against him have been delivered by committees created by the centre, which he has long accused of plotting to destabilize him.

In recent days, AAP has been ordered to reimburse the Delhi government 97 crores - the amount spent on ads that allegedly promoted Mr Kejriwal and his party in violation of Supreme Court rules. It has been asked to return a bungalow that it was assigned as a party office. The government has been asked to explain why it tried to pay a 3-crore bill for Ram Jethamalani, one of the country's most famous lawyers, hired to represent Mr Kejriwal in a defamation case filed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. ""I am fighting this case as Chief Minister...the government has every right to hire the best lawyer,"" he said today, when asked why government lawyers were not tasked with his case.

Through these scandals, Mr Kejriwal has kept up a campaign attacking the Election Commission for allowing voting machines to be rigged in Punjab, the only explanation, he says, for his defeat there. ""The Commission is pulling out all stops to help the BJP win,"" he repeated today. ""I am an engineer from IIT... I can tell you 10 ways in which EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) can be tampered,"" he said, challenging the Commission which has said that voting machines cannot be gamed, a premise it hopes to prove through a 10-day open-to-the-public hackathon next month in Delhi."
"Bahujan Samaj Party Stages Sit In In Ghaziabad, Allege Manipulation In Voting Machines","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bahujan-samaj-party-stages-sit-in-in-ghaziabad-allege-manipulation-in-voting-machines-1680165","Ghaziabad:                             Scores of BSP workers today staged a sit in outside the district collectorate in Ghaziabad, alleging the BJP managed a stunning victory in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections by ""tampering"" electronic voting machines.

Addressing the party workers, BSP zonal coordinator Raj Singh said on one hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks about eradication of corruption but on the other, his party acquired absolute majority by ""killing the democracy"" and ""manipulation of EVMs"".

He said BSP president Mayawati had raised the matter soon after the election results and now all other parties were of the same opinion (alleged tampering in EVMs).

He alleged that votes in minorities dominated areas, which were considered BSP vote bank and from where Muslim candidates were in fray, going in favour of the BJP indicated ""foul play"" by the saffron party.

Notably, BSP chief Mayawati, whose party received a major drubbing in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, had alleged that the EVMs were tampered with in such a way that whichever button was pressed, the vote went to BJP soon after election results came out.

Terming the results as ""shocking"", she had said the Election Commission should stop the counting and withhold results and hold fresh polls using traditional paper ballots. She had said it was ""unacceptable"" that the BJP was winning even in Muslim-dominated areas.

""Muslims constitute 20 per cent votes in the state and the BJP did not give a single ticket to Muslims...but in Muslim-dominated seats also the results went in the BJP's favour and this is unpalatable to the party,"" Mayawati had said.

Mr Singh said BSP will continue its protest against the BJP government till the party is removed from power by public. The BSP has already filed a petition in the Supreme Court in this connection, he said, adding re-poll should be conducted in UP using ballot papers."
"Rigged EVMs? Then How Do You Explain Me, Says Amarinder Singh","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rigged-evms-then-how-do-you-explain-me-says-amarinder-singh-1680625","A second senior leader of the Congress has stood up to defend the Electronic Voting Machine or EVM amid the party's allegation of tampering. Amarinder Singh, the chief minister of Punjab - the only state the Congress won outright in the recent round of assembly elections -- cited a simple logic: ""If EVMs were fixed then I wouldn't be sitting here. The Akalis would be.""

The Congress had won 77 of Punjab's 117 seats, ending the decade-long rule of the Akali-BJP alliance. But this morning, it joined the other opposition parties to petition the Election Commission against the use of machines. The parties allege that the machines were rigged, which made the BJP's sweeping victory in recent elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand possible.

But former law minister Veerappa Moily, who represented the Congress at the meeting, said he favoured updating technology and an investigation by a ""high powered committee into the allegations"". There, however, was ""no question of going manually, it's not a progressive step. I don't think we should go back,"" he said.

""We are censoring our own system. EVMs were launched when we were in power,"" Mr Moily told NDTV, standing by his comment that blaming EVMs for electoral losses was ""defeatist."" Concerns about EVMs had been raised even when the Congress was in power, and the machines had been tested, he added.

The statement by the two leaders fly in the face of comments by party leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad, and opposition leaders like Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal and BSP's Mayawati, who had demanded that the Election Commission ditch EVMs and revert to old-style ballot papers.

The Commission, which had repeatedly defended the EVMs, said this afternoon that in May, it would hold a hackathon, in which non-believers could try and hack the machines.

The complaints against the EVMs started after a controversial demonstration of a machine Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district, which had allegedly been used in Kanpur days before.

The opposition parties claimed that the video of a demonstration by an election officer showed an EVM recording a vote in favour of the BJP irrespective of which party was selected. The Election Commission had said the machine in question was an unused VVPAT or Voter Verified Audit Slip Facility, which was kept in reserve during the elections in Uttar Pradesh. The Commission had also pointed out that the 45-day cooling off period that is necessary for an EVM is not required for a VVPAT machine."
"As BJP Eyes Odisha Next, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's Assessment","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-bjp-eyes-odisha-next-chief-minister-naveen-patnaiks-assessment-1679601","New Delhi: HighlightsNaveen Patnaik's BJD pulled out from the BJP led-NDA in 2009
Naveen Patnaik has been Odisha's Chief Minister for the last 17 years
The BJP lost nearly 200 seats in the zila parishad elections in the state
                                Naveen Patnaik says he is not worried about the BJP's strong showing in local elections in Odisha, where assembly elections will be held in 2019. The Odisha chief minister and chief of the Biju Janata Dal says his math shows the BJP's rise ""isn't remarkable at all.""

""It's around 1/3rd in the Zila Parishad. In the wards, etc they did much worse. I don't see this as a great triumph of the BJP. They have taken over Congress pockets,"" Mr Patnaik told NDTV today about the performance of the BJP which is came in a surprising number two in the zila parishad elections across the state, behind Mr Patnaik's BJD, which has ruled Odisha for the last 17 years straight. The BJD lost nearly 200 seats.   

BJP chief Amit Shah has made it clear that after the Gujarat elections late this year, his eyes are set on winning Odisha and the BJP is holding its two-day national convention this weekend in capital Bhubaneshwar, as it bulks up its cadre in the state ahead of the assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr Shah will attend along with other top leaders.

Mr Patnaik dismissed with a smile a recent spat on Twitter between two senior leaders of his party after one, Jay Panda, wrote a newspaper editorial critical of the BJD and its boss. Mr Panda had noted that ""other parties are gaining ground because of their dynamic new leadership,"" prompting his party colleague Tathagat Sathpaty to allege that the BJP was colluding with ""one MP"" to split the BJD.

The chief minister whose party is named for his father Biju Patnaik, said, ""I do not see any discord in the parliamentary party, either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha."" Both Mr Panda and Mr Satpathy are members of Parliament.   

The BJD was once a BJP ally and even after Mr Patnaik pulled out his party from the National Democratic Alliance in 2009, it has largely served as a friendly party since the BJP came back to power at the Centre in 2014, supporting the government on key legislation. But Mr Patnaik would not comment today on whether  the BJD will support the BJP's choice of nominee for President later this year. ""Let's see who the candidate for the present presidential election will be and we will then make our judgement.,"" he said.

He accused the Modi government of being quite negligent towards Odisha, much like the previous Congress-led regime of Dr Manmohan Singh, he said. ""They have cut off funds for very important programs which the center used to finance. Also, in very important river issues such as Mahanadi and Polavram issue, they haven't been very supportive,"" he complained."
"MCD Election 2017: Voting Begins For Delhi Civic Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mcd-elections-2017-voting-begins-for-delhi-civic-polls-1684791","New Delhi:                             Voting for Delhi Civic Polls began this morning for the 272 wards in which the ruling BJP is locked in a triangular battle with the Congress and the AAP. More than 1.3 crore people are eligible to vote in the Delhi civic elections, spread over 13,000 polling stations across the national capital. Both the BJP and the Congress have exuded confidence about winning the electoral battle while the AAP is seeking to replicate its 2015 Assembly elections performance, despite suffering a debacle in the Rajouri Garden bypoll.

Polling began at 8 am amid tight security arrangements across the city.

Out of the 13,022 polling stations, the police have declared 3,284 as sensitive and 1,464 as hyper-sensitive.

Over 1.1 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise for the first time. Also, for the first time in MCD elections, None Of The Above (NOTA) option has been made available.

There are a total of 1,32,10,206 voters entitled to exercise their franchise in electing councillors for the wards falling under the three corporations - NDMC (104), SDMC (104) and EDMC (64).

Voting will be held till 5 pm. Counting of votes will be held on April 26.

The Delhi State Election Commission has deployed ample staff to man its polling stations, some of which fall in outer Delhi areas.

The wards going to polls include Narela, Okhla, Rajouri Garden, Ballimaran, Nawada, Vikas Nagar, Matiala, Munirka, Bhati, Tehkhand, Khichripur, Jhilmil, Wazirpur, Burari, Tilak Nagar, Kasturba Nagar and Andrews Ganj.

The verdict of the poll will have political ramifications beyond the capital's borders and reshape the political equations.

The BJP is seeking to retain the turf which it has held for the last 10 years and fielded all fresh faces from 267 wards. The party has projected for itself a tally of over 200 out of the 272 seats.

The AAP and the Congress too have claimed that they will cross the 200-mark.

The AAP has fielded candidates on all 272 wards while the Congress has 271 candidates in the fray.

Incidentally, in May last year, bypolls to 13 wards were held, in which the AAP had finished on top with five seats, followed by the Congress with 4, BJP at 3. One seat had gone to an independent candidate.

The AAP which had bagged 67 out of 70 seats in 2015 Delhi polls suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent Rajouri Garden bypoll.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, however, has refused to acknowledge the result as a ""trailer for MCD polls"".

His party has been highlighting ""corruption"" in the BJP-led civic bodies, an issue it seeks to leverage in this contest.

The erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated in 2012 into North, South and East Municipal Corporations.

There are 1,004 candidates vying in the NDMC area, 985 in SDMC and 548 in EDMC.

The BSP and the JD(U) have fielded 211 and 95 candidates respectively while the SP has entered the fray with 28.

The Generation-1 electronic voting machines (EVMs) are being used for the polls, which the Commission has described as ""foolproof"".

This would be the first civic poll after the latest delimitation which has redrawn the civic wards.

As per the new delimitation exercise, based on the 2011 Census, each ward now has an average of 60,000 people with an estimated 40,000 voters.

Delhi has 70 Assembly seats and before the delimitation, every constituency had four wards, but, now it ranges from 3-7.

It was on this day in 1948 that the state came into existence with the merger of 30-odd princely hill states. The Chief Minister said his government has always been considerate towards the welfare of youth and lately it has taken a decision to provide an unemployment allowance as promised in the election manifesto.

The scheme would provide Rs. 1,000 per month to those unemployed who have minimum 102 qualification or above.

Likewise, an allowance of Rs. 1,500 per month would be given to the youths with physical disabilities. Both allowances will benefit 150,000 youths.

The Chief Minister also announced that the period of regularisation of contractual employees would be reduced to three years instead of five.

He announced that the monthly honorarium of Special Police Officers deployed in Chamba district bordering militancy-infested Jammu and Kashmir would be increased to Rs. 6,000 from Rs. 4,000.

There are around 500 Special Police Officers assisting the paramilitary forces after the massacre of 35 people in Churah area by terrorists in 1998.

The Chief Minister unfurled the national flag with the national anthem being played by a Home Guard band.

Singh said the state has been giving priority to upgrading the skills of the unemployed youth. In this regard, the government has implemented the Skill Development Allowance Scheme with an outlay of Rs. 500 crore.

Till date the skill development allowance has been given to 152,000 youth.

His demand comes in the wake of the poll panel throwing an open challenge to hack its EVMs following a chorus by Opposition parties on alleged tampering of the machines in the recent state Assembly elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh where BJP staged a stunning victory.

Mr Singh said the Election Commission, instead of limiting its objections to EVM hacking, should also allow examination of its software at the stage of writing it from the server.

""EC limiting objections to EVMs. It must allow examination of possibility of software tampering at stage of writing it from server. There is a strong possibility of tampering coding at the stage of writing software i.e. EVMs can be pre-tampered. So no need for hacking...

""EC must devise a way of supervision by political parties of the coding software of EVMs, like it does at subsequent stages. Would they agree?"" the Congress leader tweeted.

The Election Commission had announced that from first week of May, experts, scientists and technocrats can try for a week or 10 days to hack the electronic voting machines.

Several opposition parties have demanded that voting in India should return to the old ballot papers system. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, asked the Election Commission and the Centre to explain the delay in switching to upgraded machines that provide a paper receipt (VVAPT), showing the ballot of each voter."

The Election Commission has asked a panel of names to replace the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police of Bhind district.  The order came after reports that machines with the Voter Verified Audit Slip Facility or VVPATs were dispensing slips with the BJP symbol irrespective of which button was pressed.

The by-elections to two assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh -- Ater and Bandhavgarh - will be held on April 9.

The dig was at the poll panel, which had dismissed the possibility of tampering with EVMs after allegations from AAP, Mayawati's BSP and the Congress.

On Saturday, the Election Commission decided to fly in top election officers from Delhi and Andhra Pradesh to oversee the by-elections in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and address the concerns of the opposition. The panel had also said it would depute two teams its officials and technical experts to ensure that EVMs and VVPATs had not been tampered with.

The move came after a video of a demonstration by the state's election officer, which, opposition parties claimed, showed the EVM recording a vote in favour of the BJP irrespective of which party was selected. The video renewed the fears that EVMs could be tampered, prompting the Congress and AAP's Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal rushing to the panel earlier on Saturday."
"Delhi By-Polls: AAP Faces Litmus, BJP Seeks Revival, Congress Survival","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/delhi-by-polls-aap-faces-litmus-bjp-seeks-revival-congress-survival-1678772","New Delhi:                             By-elections to the West Delhi's Rajouri Garden assembly seat over this weekend could be the trailer to the national capital's municipal elections this month that is seen as a litmus test for the Aam Aadmi Party which won an unprecedented 67 of the 70 seats in 2015 assembly elections.

It would also indicate if the high-pitch campaign by the BJP and the Congress, which were decimated in the state elections two years earlier, had been able to dent AAP's support base. The results for the by-elections will be declared on April 13, ten days before the capital votes for the three civic bodies.

Since 1993, Rajouri Garden had been electing a Congress candidate with the exception of the last two elections when it voted the BJP-Akali Dal combine candidate in 2013, and in 2015, when it gave the AAP a chance. Quite like the rest of Delhi.

AAP legislator Jarnail Singh had quit the seat after the party decided to field him in this week's Punjab assembly elections against the Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal, necessitating the by-elections. Singh lost, but he isn't coming back to Delhi.

The party has come up with a new face - Harjeet Singh - for the election. The BJP-SAD combine has fielded veteran Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who had won the seat in 2013 but lost out by about 10,000 votes in 2015. He received about 44,000 votes.

The Congress, which ruled the city for 15 years at a stretch, is leaving no stone unturned to pull off a victory and register its presence in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

The seat fell vacant early this year after AAP's Jarnail Singh quit as MLA to contest Punjab Assembly poll against SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal, only to lose and considerably dent AAP's chances of holding on to the seat.

While Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal addressed one rally in the area, the Congress brought in newly elected Punjab CM Amarinder Singh to address the voters in constituency dominated by the Punjabi community. The two had several feuds in the run up to the Punjab polls where Amarinder, a Congress giant, trounced the Kejriwal-led AAP and relegated the BJP-SAD to the third position.

"BJP Strong No 2 In West Bengal By-Poll, Top Leaders Assigned To Win State","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-strong-no-2-in-west-bengal-by-poll-top-leaders-assigned-to-win-state-1681456","Kolkata:                             After shocking the Left by placing second in this week's assembly by-election in West Bengal behind the ruling Trinamool Congress, the BJP has launched a 'Mission Bengal' that aims at preparing the party to make major inroads in the panchayat or local elections to be held next year. The party is sending senior leaders to West Bengal to interact with workers as it builds its cadre in a state where it held no assembly seats till last year's election.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was in Hooghly yesterday, and today, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharati are in Kolkata and Howrah.

The Kanthi Dakshin assembly constituency yesterday sent a Trinamool Congress legislator to the Bengal assembly again, but it was the BJP's performace that drew all the attention. The party placed second, ahead of number 3 Left by at least 30,000 votes. BJP chief Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted special thanks to West Bengal's voters and Mr Shah declared the BJP ""the principal opposition party"" in the state.

In assembly elections less than a year ago, the BJP had placed a distant third behind the Trinamool and the Left in Kanthi Dakshin, with only 15,000 votes and less than 9 per cent vote share. It has almost 31 per cent of the vote share this time.

The Trinamool has improved its vote share by two per cent. The Left, which ruled the state for three decades before losing to Mamata Banerjee in 2011, has only 10 per cent of the vote share this time, while the Congress, main opposition for years, is a faraway fourth with a little over one per cent.

Ahead of the by-election, the BJP and its ideological mentor the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worked hard to expand the party's footprint in East Midnapore where Kanthi Dakshin is. The BJP's strong performance in the Trinamool stronghold is also being credited to its Ram Navami mobilisation.

Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attacked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's government on Thursday, saying, ""Ram Navami celebrations have happened peacefully everywhere in India. Why is it not happening in West Bengal? And why should you stop just one community from celebrating festivals? It's a total failure of the law and order machinery here.""

The Trinamool Congress said it was unaffected as the BJP has gained at the cost of the Left.  ""We are here to come first and between the first and second the difference is so huge that it does not matter who is second and who is third,"" said Trinamool General Secretary Mukul Roy.

But the BJP leadership has made clear it is not in Bengal to play second fiddle for too long. The party, which had no almost no political presence in the state till a few years ago, first made an impact in the 2014 national elections. It won only two Lok Sabha seats, but increased its vote share in the state from four to 17 per cent. In last year's assembly elections in West Bengal, the BJP won four seats.

The BJP is strategically working his way up in states where the party has not traditionally been a major player, building cadre strength at the grass roots and focusing on winning local elections.

After a strong performance in local elections in neighbouring Odisha this year, the BJP chief has announced that his party's next target is forming government in that state in 2019. The party has chosen Odisha capital Bhubaneshwar to hold its next national executive meeting starting tomorrow."

"PM Narendra Modi's Breakfast With Gujarat Lawmakers Including LK Advani","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modis-breakfast-with-gujarat-lawmakers-including-lk-advani-1672998","New Delhi: HighlightsGujarat scheduled to vote by December
PM hosts breakfast for party MPs from Gujarat, Rajasthan
Yesterday, he met with Uttar Pradesh MPs
                                Today, it was the turn of the BJP's parliamentarians from Gujarat and Rajasthan to breakfast with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence. The PM met with nearly 50 of them to discuss the election that's due in December in his home state of Gujarat.

Yesterday, MPs from Uttar Pradesh were hosted by the Prime Minister to celebrate the party's tremendous win in the politically-strategic state. They were also cautioned against seeking favours from the new Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath. Mr Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah said Yogi Adityanath must be allowed to focus on turning around the law and order problems in UP, and that phoning him to influence the transfer of officials or to seek appointments for friends and family is strictly off-limits.

After the BJP's blazing victory in Uttar Pradesh, there have been reports that the government will seek to advance the election in Gujarat to benefit from the famous ""Modi Wave."" Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told NDTV last week that the party in Gujarat will be ""ready for early elections, if needed.""

The BJP, which has governed Gujarat uninterrupted for 19 years has announced ""Mission 150"" - winning at least 150 of the state's 182 assembly constituencies. The party currently has 123 seats.

Party veteran LK Advani, who represents Gandhinagar in Lok Sabha, attended PM Modi's breakfast as did Union minister Smriti Irani. BJP chief Amit Shah, who was also present, will travel to Gujarat at the end of the month.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been campaigning for months for his Aam Admi Party (AAP) in the PM's home state, vowing to serve as the people's choice at a time when the BJP is facing anti-incumbency and the Congress is considered irrelevant and ineffectual as the main opposition party. However, AAP's inability to win Punjab in the elections that concluded this month will curb some of the momentum it was gaining in Gujarat, its leaders have ceded."
"'Victory In November,' Says Amit Shah, Shutting Early Gujarat Poll Talk","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujarat-elections-wont-be-early-suggest-amit-shah-but-makes-odisha-target-clear-1675061","Ahmedabad:                             BJP chief Amit Shah put a lid on speculation that the party could opt for early elections in Gujarat when he said today that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""victory chariot"" will roll into his home state in November. Assembly elections are due in the state only in November end, but there has been buzz that the ruling BJP could call early elections to cash in on a surge in popularity evidenced by party's massive victory in Uttar Pradesh.  

Mr Shah, who too is from Gujarat and is visiting the state for the first time after the party's success this month in assembly elections, was being felicitated by party workers at the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad when he said, ""Narendra bhai's vijay rath, after traversing through the country will move into the state in November. Are you ready to give it a rousing welcome and work towards the party's success?""

The BJP has ruled Gujarat for the last two decades including 13 years when PM Modi was Chief Minister, but the state has been cause for worry for the party recently because of big agitations by the powerful Patel community and by Dalits. It also fears an anti-incumbency sentiment in the state since PM Modi moved to the centre three years ago and many see wisdom in calling early elections.  

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani did not rule it out earlier this week, only saying that the party's central leadership would take a final decision. ""I would like to say that the state BJP is ready for polls, if they are held earlier or even if they are held on schedule,"" he said

The BJP has installed governments in four of the five states where elections have held so far this year. Mr Shah said after winning Gujarat, the party would focus on forming government in Odisha, where elections will be held in 2019.

The BJP chief confirmed that the party's win in UP will be a big theme in its campaign for Gujarat when he said, ""We had taken a vow on the banks of the Ganga that we will cross the 300 seat target in UP and now on the banks of the Sabarmati, we are repeating the vow that we will win 150 plus seats in Gujarat.""

The party has identified UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as a star campaigner in Gujarat apart from PM Modi and Mr Shah.  

The BJP chief dismissed chief rival in Gujarat, the Congress, and also Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party as non-starters. The Congress' ""dream"" to wrest Gujarat from the BJP would remain just that, he said.

AAP makes its debut in Gujarat in this year's assembly election. The party, which had swept Delhi two years ago, had hoped to add Punjab and Goa to its kitty in this year's assembly election, but failed to make a mark in either state. ""During elections AAP emerges like mushrooms, only to fade away,'' observed Amit Shah."
"BJP Protests Against Trinamool Congress Leaders Seen In Narada Sting","http://www.ndtv.com/kolkata-news/bjp-protests-against-trinamool-congress-leaders-seen-in-narada-sting-1672440","Kolkata:                             The BJP in Kolkata on Wednesday hit the streets demanding the resignation of Trinamool Congress lawmakers and ministers who were allegedly seen on tape accepting bribes for favours. The Narada sting was released just before the assembly elections in West Bengal last year but last week the Calcutta High Court said prima facie it seemed to be a cognizable offence and ordered the CBI to investigate. The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court after leaders of Mamata Banerjee's party appealed against the move.

BJP protesters, who marched from College Square near the party office to Esplanade less than 5 km away, got into a scuffle with the police at Esplanade as the police put up barriers to stop the protesters from entering the main square at Esplanade. An effigy with the faces of the politicians seen in the Narada sting was burnt right beside the barricade. ""Not just the Minister seen in the tape, the Chief Minister should also resign as she is leading a corrupt government,"" BJP leader Chandra Bose said. Mr Bose had contested against Mamata Banerjee in the Assembly elections last year.

""Make room for 30-40 people in jail. First start with 12 people and gradually all the secrets will be out in and the space in jail will run out. TMC has big leaders, it will take time to make 5 star arrangements inside the jail,"" Rajya Sabha lawmaker and BJP leader Roopa Ganguly said.

But it's not just the BJP that is upping the ante against Mamata Banerjee as the Trinamool finds itself in an embarrassing position after the Narada sting operation. The Congress has planned a similar rally in the city on Saturday and the Left is also targeting Mamata Banerjee for protecting her partymen.

""The administration is busy protecting the culprits and falsely implicating the whistle-blower. Now, Mamata will have to rush to Modi government to seek support to save themselves from CBI probe,"" CPI(M) lawmaker Mohammad Salim said.

Meanwhile, the man behind the Narada sting operation case, Mathew Samuel has complained to the Kerala Director General of Police and the Station House Officer (SHO) of Dwarka Police Station in the capital about a threat to him, his family and colleagues after what he describes as several instances of his colleagues and family members being followed by unknown men. Mr Samuel has claimed the suspicious people shadowing him could be an attempt to eliminate him and has demanded an inquiry."
"Donald Trump Calls PM Narendra Modi, Congratulates Him On Poll Wins","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/donald-trump-calls-pm-narendra-modi-congratulates-him-for-up-victory-1674161","New Delhi:                             US President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday evening and congratulated him on the BJP's huge success in the recent state elections.

""The president spoke with Chancellor Merkel and the Indian Prime Minister today to congratulate them on their party's success in recent elections,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday.

The BJP rode a Modi super-wave to a massive victory in Uttar Pradesh earlier this month, winning 312 of the state's 403 seats. The BJP also swept neighbouring Uttarakhand and formed governments in Goa and Manipur, with no party getting a majority. The only setback the BJP saw was in Punjab, where the Congress won.

The elections in the five states had turned into a virtual referendum on PM Modi's popularity following his decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.

This is the second time Mr Trump has called PM Modi ever since his inauguration as President of the United States. The leaders of the world's two biggest democracies last spoke in January when President Trump called up PM Modi and discussed the security situation in South and Central Asia. India and the United States will ""stand shoulder to shoulder"" to fight global terrorism, the White House had said after that interaction.

The significance of US' partnership with India was reflected in the fact that President Trump called Prime Minister Modi before he spoke with important allies like Britain, Germany and Japan or major powers like China and Russia since formally taking office.

During that call, President Trump had emphasised that the United States ""considers India a true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world,"" according to a White House readout of the call.

Both the leaders invited each other to their respective capitals and indicated that they had a warm exchange which included a commitment to ""standing shoulder to shoulder"" against terrorism and improving economic cooperation."
"Amarinder Singh, Man On A Mission, Bans 'Lal Battis' In Punjab. That Includes The Chief Minister.","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-man-on-a-mission-bans-lal-battis-in-punjab-that-includes-the-chief-minister-1671312","Chandigarh:                             Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered the removal of beacons from all government vehicles, including his own. Mr Singh seems to be a man on a mission to revive the Congress, which has been performing poorly in elections in other states. After getting a majority in Punjab's recently-held assembly elections, the Chief Minister seized the opportunity and swung into action. Putting a ban on the use of 'lal battis', or red beacons on government vehicles is one of the first major decisions taken by the new government in the state.

""Red beacons were removed from the vehicles of the Chief Minister and other members of the council of ministers on Saturday itself, without waiting for a notification, soon after the Congress government decided to put a ban on its use,"" an official spokesperson said.

In a series of austere measures, the Amarinder Singh-led cabinet also decided to ban ministers from traveling overseas for two years. It also banned organising of banquets on state expense as part of the government's move to shed VIP frills. This, the party says, is in line with their election manifesto. ""In our manifesto, the Chief Minister and cabinet ministers were exempted. Despite this they decided to bring themselves within the ambit of the decision,"" the Congress' spokesperson said.

Punjab is currently burdened by a huge debt inherited from the previous government in the state. This has been done ""to clean up the system of the much-talked-about VIP culture, that has been a massive expense on the state's exchequer over the years,"" the party's spokesman added.

During the previous government, Punjab, which was already under thousands of crores of rupees in debt, had spent Rs. 97 crore to buy luxury vehicles for its political top brass over a period of eight years, an RTI application had revealed in June last year. The vehicles were purchased between 2007 and 2015 by the transport department for the use of then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, his son and then Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and other ministers, as per the Right to Information (RTI) reply given to activist Jasdeepak Singh.

The transport department in Punjab had spent the highest - Rs. 17,77,92,929 in 2012-2013 on vehicles and Rs. 8,38,28,895 in 2008-09. The expenditure incurred during 2014-15 was Rs. 13,13,90,655.

The process of finalisation of the policy on the use of red beacons on government vehicles, except those used in an emergency like ambulance or fire brigade, and those of the Chief Justice and the Judges of Punjab and Haryana High Court, has started. ""Once the necessary notification is issued, all government departments would have to strictly implement it,"" Congress' spokesperson added.

The process of implementation of other cabinet decisions has also been initiated, the spokesperson said, adding that all decisions would be executed in a time-bound manner, with the Chief Minister and the ministers personally monitoring it to ensure that there is no default or delay.

The Amarinder Singh cabinet, in its first meeting on Saturday, has taken over 120 decisions."
"For Delhi Civic Polls, It Will Be Campaigner Yogi Adityanath Versus Arvind Kejriwal","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/for-delhi-civic-polls-it-will-be-campaigner-yogi-adityanath-versus-arvind-kejriwal-1674543","New Delhi:                             Yogi Adityanath's stock is high as a star campaigner after the BJP's massive win in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The UP Chief Minister, already pencilled in to campaign for the party in the crucial Gujarat assembly elections later this year, will also be seen in Delhi, where he headlines a power-packed star cast of campaigners for the municipal elections month.

The BJP, having dominated the Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD for years, is taking no chances; it has been challenged this time by Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which has focused all its attention on winning the civic election after faring poorly in assembly elections in Punjab and Goa.

Apart from Yogi Adityanath, who took oath last week as UP chief minister, four other BJP chief ministers and 14 central ministers feature in the BJP's list of star campaigners for the Delhi civic poll. The party's core team for the election has four union ministers - Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh, Sanjeev Balyan and Vijay Goel.

To stave off any anti-incumbency sentiment, the BJP has said it will field new faces for all the 272 seats in the civic bodies - North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporations, together the MCD. No sitting councillors or their family members will be fielded, the party has decided. On Monday, party chief Amit Shah held two separate meetings with union ministers, members of Parliament and the party's Delhi leaders to discuss strategy.

The Aam Aadmi Party, having failed to spread its influence it other states, is now attempting to extend its success in the Delhi assembly elections, two years ago, to the ward-level in the capital. The BJP, trounced in that election, will mark AAP candidate for candidate in the MCD polls, and Amit Shah has ordered that only residents of a certain ward must be fielded there.

The party heads into the Delhi local elections with a string of successes in municipal polls behind it, most recently in Maharashtra and Odisha.

Polling for the 272 wards of the MCD will be held on April 23."

Confirming that Yogi Adityanath will campaign in Gujarat, state BJP president Jitu Vaghani said, ""All chief ministers of our party across the country have been invited to campaign and Yogi ji will also be there.""

State party spokesperson Bharat Pandya added that the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister campaigning in Gujarat would help the party immensely.

He said, ""Yogi ji's work as Chief Minister is being discussed and appreciated not just at the national level but even at the international level. So, his coming to Gujarat for campaigning will definitely help the BJP.""

Mr Pandya said Uttar Pradesh is the largest state in the country in terms of population and developments there have massive impact in all other states.

The BJP spokesperson, however, was quick to add that there was no replacement of Modi. ""Ever since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, it has been a matter of pride for people in Gujarat and for us...Modi wave itself is enough,"" Mr Pandya said.

The opposition Congress asserted that the BJP was trying to play its old game of communal polarisation by calling Yogi Adityanath to canvass. Party spokesperson Himanshu Patel said it would not help the BJP this time around.

""People are fed up of the BJP rule and all issues like atrocities against Dalits, women, Patels, farmers and contract employees of the government will go against it,"" he said."
"Prashant Kishor To Decide On Joining Congress Within 15 Days: Sources","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-congress-gushes-over-prashant-kishor-he-could-join-the-party-sources-1671874","New Delhi: HighlightsPrashant Kishor handled Congress election strategy for UP, Punjab
Credited by Captain Amarinder Singh for Punjab win
He's talking to team about joining Congress, say sources
                                Five days ago, a poster at the Congress office in Lucknow called out Prashant Kishor, sarcastically offering five lakhs for any information on the election strategist's coordinates. The poster was brought down hurriedly on the orders of senior leaders, the partyman responsible for it was suspended for six years, and on Tuesday, the Congress gushed on Twitter about Mr Kishor, offering some belated TLC to the 40-year-old while crediting him with a big role in the party's victory in Punjab.

Through the inquest of the Congress' debacle in Uttar Pradesh - one of three states that he managed - Mr Kishor has not commented on either his own or the party's missteps, or what relationship they will have in the future. This morning, sources close to him said that over the next two weeks, Mr Kishor will consult with top members of his team - the data-crunching, election start-up called I-PAC or the Indian Political Action Committee - to explore whether any future association with the Congress should be as ""an insider"" - a member of the party, as opposed to an adjunct position, however senior.

However, top aides at I-PAC said later in the day - after NDTV reported the story - that ""even speculation of him joining the Congress is completely premature.""
 Prashant Kishor handled Congress election strategy for UP and Punjab. Mr Kishor, whose antipathy for interviews is well-established, has said in the past that he has no wish to enter politics. But sources say that the Uttar Pradesh Project has taught him that the a section of the Congress used his status as a consultant both to curb his influence and to brand him as a big reason for its worst-ever result in India's politically most strategic state - it won just seven of 403 seats. Any future assignments, said Mr Kishor's aides on the condition of anonymity, would need to guarantee him the sort of access, time and input that allowed him to chart a winning campaign for Captain Amarinder Singh in Punjab.

On Twitter today, the Captain, who brought the Congress back to power in Punjab after 10 years, purveying the party with its sole sweet spot in the recent elections, thanked Mr Kishor.

Sources in Mr Kishor's team say that he continues to enjoy the confidence of Congress bosses Rahul Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka. As the strategist surveys his options, the election in Gujarat will be a crucial factor. The BJP has ruled Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state for 19 years uninterrupted. The Congress is, like in many other states, a spent force in Gujarat.  And the emphatic defeat of Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party or AAP in Punjab significantly depletes its chances of serving as a formidable challenger.

Considered an election wunderkind after he was credited with devising a high-tech and innovative campaign for PM Modi in 2012, he was hired by the Congress in 2016 to help change its fortune. He signed up to manage the party's strategy in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab and then, belatedly, in Uttarakhand. In Punjab, he found a willing and tireless ally in Captain Singh, at whose home he stayed, a fact often referred to by both men when reports emerged of clashes over selecting candidates and other key issues. 
 Despite the UP debacle, sources say Prashant Kishor continues to enjoy the confidence of Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka.Sources close to the strategist say that when attributing culpability for the Congress' performance in Uttar Pradesh, it's important to remember that Mr Kishor's early suggestions that were devised as ""game-changers""- including the promotion of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as the presumptive Chief Minister- were rejected.  He did his best, they say, given the determined opposition from the party's old guard, leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad and Raj Babbar, who were reportedly distrusting of Mr Kishor's ideas and his easy access to the Gandhi family."

""If we come to power, our first step would be to abolish the faulty RUSA scheme from the education system of Himachal Pradesh,"" he said at a gathering held under the BJP's 'Mafia Raj Hatao, Pradesh Bachao' campaign here. He alleged that results were being delayed after the scheme was implemented by the Congress government.

The BJP has planned to hold 100 such gatherings under the campaign before the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections, slated later this year. ""The Virbhadra Singh-led government had announced to open around 46 government colleges. One such college was recently opened in a primary school's building in Kangra district's Lunj area. The state government has made a mockery out of the education system in the state,"" he said.

The former chief minister claimed that the law and order situation had deteriorated under the present dispensation. ""Sand from the Yamuna river is being taken to Uttarakhand. The 'Transfer Mafia' is working from the Chief Minister's office and 480 Deodhar trees have been cut in Taradevi. The 'Drug Mafia' is also operating in the state,"" Dhumal alleged. He claimed that of the 85 candidates selected for Class IV posts in the Secretariat only three were from Himachal Pradesh's largest district, Kangra.

Mr Singh, who alleged that the BJP indulged in buying of lawmakers in the state, tweeted this morning, ""If he (Manohar Parrikar) has to thank anyone it is Nitin Gadkari who did aggressive MLA Shopping on 12th March early morning from Hotel in Goa.""

Demanding apology from the BJP, Mr Singh said, ""Shame on you Mr Parrikar and your hunger for power. You have cheated the People of Goa. Apologise to them.""

Digvijaya Singh also alleged that the Goa Governor Mridula Sinha ""robbed the mandate of people"".

Mr Parrikar, who resigned as the country's Defence Minister to return to his home state earlier this month, visited the Rajya Sabha on Friday during Zero Hour to thank the members of the House.

While thanking the members of the House he took a dig at Digvijaya Singh, who was the leader in-charge of Goa during assembly elections. ""My special thanks to honourable member Digvijaya Singh, who happened to be in Goa but did nothing so that I could form the government.""

In election results announced earlier this month, no party won a majority in Goa. The BJP, which won fewer seats than the Congress, quickly gathered the support of regional parties and staked claim to form government. The Congress and its senior leader in-charge of the state Digvijaya Singh could only watch helplessly as Mr Parrikar resigned at the centre and took oath as Chief Minister, winning a vote of confidence the same weekend.

Many state Congress leaders have blamed Digvijaya Singh for the party failing to form government in Goa.Digvijaya Singh has alleged that Goa Governor Mridula Sinha should not have invited the BJP to form government without consulting the Congress as single largest party in Goa, and had moved a motion in the Rajya Sabha to discuss her conduct. It has not been taken up yet.

Manohar Parrikar had resigned as Goa Chief Minister in 2014 to come to the centre as Defence Minister and a Rajya Sabha MP. Since he did not contest this year's Goa polls, he will now have to be elected from an assembly seat in the state within six months."

                                Amit Shah, Gujarat legislator, arrived at the state assembly in Gandhinagar on Thursday morning to a huge welcome from hundreds of BJP workers and also MLAs and ministers. The BJP chief, who is the party MLA from the Naranpura constituency, is attending an assembly session after two years. Mr Shah had last attended a session in March, 2015.

The BJP chief was accompanied by his wife and son. Among those who greeted him with flowers was the BJP's state chief Jitu Vaghani and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.  

Amit Shah is on a two-day visit to his home state to take stock of preparations for state elections later this year and is holding multiple meetings with top party leaders in the state.

At a big reception hosted yesterday by the party to felicitate Mr Shah for the BJP's enormous victory in Uttar Pradesh, he ruled out calling early elections in the state by saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""victory chariot"" would roll into Gujarat in November. Elections are due in Gujarat in November end.

He has set the state leaders a target of winning 150 of Gujarat's 182 assembly seats, demanding a repeat of UP, where the party has won over 300 seats as it had pledged, he said.

The BJP has ruled Gujarat for the last two decades decimating chief rival Congress, but this year it faces its toughest battle in years. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi - whose 13-year stint as Gujarat chief minister was the party's golden period in the state - moving to Delhi after the 2014 national election, the BJP lost its momentum under his successor Anandiben Patel.

She was seen to mishandle the massive agitation for reservation in government jobs and colleges by the powerful Patel community and finally resigned last year citing old age. Vijay Rupani, seen as an Amit Shah man, was given the tough charge of leading the party to this year's election.

The BJP also fears an anti-incumbency sentiment, and is expected to build its campaign in Gujarat around the popularity of PM Modi as it did in UP. The talk of early elections in Gujarat had begun as suggestions were made that the party could cash in on the UP wave."
"Big Test For N Biren Singh, BJP's First Chief Minister In Manipur, Today","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/big-test-for-bjps-first-chief-minister-in-manipur-today-1671249","Imphal:                             BJP's N Biren Singh, who took oath as Manipur's Chief Minister on March 15, has to prove his majority in the state assembly today. Despite being the second largest party - with 21 legislators - in the recently-concluded assembly elections, the BJP claims to have the support of 33 legislators with the help of regional parties and independent lawmakers. Hours before the crucial trust vote, the economic blockade in the state, which lasted for 130 days, was lifted. The blockade, which was led by the United Naga Council, ended after talks were successful with the central and state governments. ""We have fulfilled the promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by convincing the UNC to lift the blockade,"" Chief Minister Biren Singh told NDTV last evening. PM Modi had vowed to remove the blockade if BJP was elected to power in a state ruled by the Congress for 15 years under Okram Ibobi Singh. This is the first time a BJP government is heading the state.

The BJP and the Congress are keeping their cards close to the chest ahead of today's crucial trust vote in the Manipur Assembly. 17 of the BJP's 21 newly elected legislators have been camping at a hotel in Assam's Guwahati. The Congress, on the other hand, has sheltered its 27 MLAs in the house of one of its legislators in Imphal. ""We have kept our legislators in Guwahati in response to the Congress keeping their MLAs in a house in Imphal. Our legislators thought we must also stand united,"" said Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP's key strategist for Manipur.

No party received a simple majority in the 2017 Manipur assembly election. The Congress, which had ruled the state for 3 consecutive terms (15 years), emerged as a single largest party with 28 of the total 60 seats. The BJP, which debuted in the state, came second with 21 seats. A party needs a minimum support of 31 legislators to form a government in Manipur.

The BJP says it has the support of 33 legislators with the help of the NPP, NPF, LJP, an independent legislator, a Trinamool Congress MLA, and Shyam Kumar - a defector from the Congress - who took oath as a minister in the N Biren Singh government. Speaking to NDTV, Trinamool Congress legislator Robindro Singh said the party gave him full freedom to support the BJP. ""I spoke to (senior TMC leader) Mukul Roy. They left it to me. They said if you can do well by supporting the BJP, then you can take your own call,"" he said.

In less than a week since being elected Chief Minister, N Biren Singh's government successfully lifted the economic blockade that had crippled the state's supply lines for the last 130 days. ""This is a good beginning of good governance,"" Mr Singh told NDTV. A joint statement released after the meeting stated that there would be ""unconditional release of the arrested UNC leaders and all cases related to the economic blockade against the Naga tribe leaders and student leaders will be closed"".  It also said that the next round of talks will be held within a month.

Governor Najma Heptulla said the first step of the newly formed government led by the BJP ""will usher in an era of peace and prosperity"" in the north-eastern state.

The Naga groups had called for a blockade on November 1 last year after the erstwhile Congress government of Chief Minister Ibobi Singh carved out seven new districts in the state, especially in the Naga dominated areas. The Naga leadership had called it an attack on its tribal lands and cultural integrity protected under the constitution.

The protesters had cut off the two main highways - NH2 and NH 37 - depriving the state of essential commodities. Long queues at fuel stations had become a common sight in the state capital of Imphal where the price of LPG cylinders shot up to Rs. 2,000 each in the black market. Paramilitary forces were also mobilised in the state after incidents of violence.

Multiple rounds of talks in Imphal and Delhi were inconclusive. Union Minister Kiren Rijiju had alleged that the blockade was the ""handiwork"" of the state's then Chief Minister."
"Thanks But No Thanks, Parkash Singh Badal Says To Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's Offer","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/parkash-singh-badal-politely-declines-punjab-chief-ministers-offer-for-government-house-1671190","Chandigarh:                             Former Chief Minister of Punjab Parkash Singh Badal, who helmed the state for 10 years, is hunting for a house nowadays. On Sunday, he ""politely"" declined the new Congress government's offer of free government accommodation in the state capital Chandigarh.

The Amarinder Singh-government had offered a suitable bungalow to Badal, a five-time Chief Minister of Punjab.

Mr Badal said, ""I am thankful to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for his gracious gesture. It is very graceful of him to make this offer. But I am making my own arrangements for stay. I value his sentiment highly and fully reciprocate it.""

The veteran Akali leader's aides are hunting for a house for him in the town's Sector 8 for a week now.

Mr Badal's family owns two big-sized plots of residential land, measuring almost 1.5 acres, in upscale Sector 9, but a new structure is coming up after the old one was pulled down.

Mr Badal, 89, lived in the chief ministerial bungalow in Chandigarh's tony Sector 2 before his Shiromani Akali Dal was routed in the February 4 assembly elections.

Since Mr Badal is only a legislator from Lambi and his party has only 15 legislators in the new assembly, he does not qualify for the status of Leader of Opposition and hence not officially entitled to a government bungalow.

According to reports, the SAD-BJP alliance lost the elections due to a drop in the vote share. The alliance received a 31 per cent vote share while the Congress and the AAP got 38 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal added.

Mr Badal, the country's oldest serving Chief Minister till his party was decimated in the electoral battle, did not attend the swearing in of the new Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on March 16."
"BJP In Gujarat Is Clear On Star Campaigners: PM Modi And Yogi Adityanath","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-in-gujarat-is-clear-on-star-campaigners-pm-modi-and-yogi-adityanath-1674306","Gandhinagar: HighlightsGujarat assembly election to be held by December
BJP seeking fifth consecutive term
Yogi Adityanath will be a top campaigner, says party
                                Yogi Adityanath will be among the show-stoppers that the BJP will use in its campaign in Gujarat, where elections are due by December. The 44-year-old Yogi or monk was the surprise pick for Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. ""All Chief Ministers of our party across the country have been invited to campaign and Yogi ji will also be there,"" confirmed Jitu Vaghani, who heads the BJP in the state.

""Yogi ji's work as Chief Minister is being discussed and appreciated not just at the national level but even at the international level. So, his coming to Gujarat for campaigning will definitely help the BJP,"" he professed. Since taking office, Yogi Adityanath has operated in top gear, implementing major policies important to the BJP even though the new cabinet has yet to meet. The police is patrolling public spaces to protect women as part of the Yogi's commitment to urgently correcting Uttar Pradesh's depraved lawlessness; slaughterhouses are being checked and sealed for violating laws, a move that critics say targets Muslims who run most abattoirs.

The Chief Minister's surprise check at a police station in the heart of Lucknow and along the banks of the River Gomti to ensure the newly-developed area is pristine, his visit to a gang-rape survivor in hospital, his announcement that his administration will favour no caste or religion, have all given him prime positioning in the news cycle. The BJP in Gujarat says that because of its size and political vitality, UP and its Chief Minister will influence voters heavily in the coastal state too.

However, the party was quick to stress that nothing competes with the star power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Ever since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, it has been a matter of pride for people in Gujarat and for us... the Modi wave itself is enough,"" said Mr Pandya, referring to the pole position of the PM in his party's sweeping victory in Uttar Pradesh.

The BJP has governed the PM's home state of Gujarat since 1998; it is seeking a fifth consecutive term. The party has deployed the slogan ""UP mein 325, Gujarat mein 150"" (325 seats in UP, 150 in Gujarat) to indicate it wants to win the upcoming election with the sort of record margin it accrued in India's most-populous state.

The opposition Congress claims that the BJP's invite to the Yogi signals its plan to polarise voters by religion. Party spokesperson Himanshu Patel claimed that the plan will not succeed and that the BJP will stumble over its conflict with former supporters the Patels, who have turned on the party for not being included in affirmative action policies, and over its inability to prevent attacks on Dalits in Gujarat.

Over the weekend, a riot in the Patan district of Gujarat killed one person and injured 14 others after a fight erupted between Muslim and Hindu school students."
"Mayawati Dares BJP To Hold Polls Using Ballot Papers","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mayawati-dares-bjp-to-hold-polls-using-ballot-papers-1671770","New Delhi:                             ""If your conscience is so clear, why not call for elections (again) using paper ballot,"". That was  Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati's message to the BJP in the Rajya Sabha, re-iterating her allegation that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) were tampered with in the just concluded Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.  

Ms Mayawati was undeterred as the members from the treasury benches opposed and shouted against her. 

When Congress was in power, senior BJP leaders had expressed apprehensions on the use of EVMs saying free and fair elections cannot happen using the EVMs, she said in Rajya Sabha today.

On Monday, Ms Mayawati said that her party will move court against the alleged tampering. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had rejected her claim that the voting machines were rigged and said her demand for a re-poll using ballot papers was legally untenable.

The former Chief Minister of UP who won just 19 seats in the 403-member House in her state said the results were ""not a verdict of people but a verdict of EVMs."" She said her party has given a notice under rule 267 seeking suspension of business to take up the issue.

She demanded that a law be brought in the on-going budget session of the Parliament to scrap the use of EVMs in future elections.
  
Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien said he would not allow the notice as a short duration discussion on electoral reforms is scheduled tomorrow and these points could be raised then. Ms Mayawati, however, persisted with her point for some time but took her seat after Mr Kurien insisted on not allowing her notice.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too had claimed that EVMs were tampered with in Punjab to keep the Aam Aadmi Party out of power.

""Dal main kuch kaala hain (Something is fishy),"" she said on the BJP's victory, further intensifying the debate surrounding the functioning of electronic voting machines or EVMs.

Ms Banerjee, who heads the Trinamool Congress, claimed that the arithmetic of BJP's victory in Uttar Pradesh does not add up.

""How come, without doing anything and with the negative impact of demonetisation, the BJP got more than 300 seats? There is something wrong and fishy about it. Mayawati has raised doubts about EVMs and I think they still have the opportunity to challenge its functioning in courts,"" said the West Bengal Chief Minister in an interview to ABP Ananda, a local Bengali channel.

She further advised Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati to forge an alliance against the BJP.

In the interview, Ms Banerjee also launched a scathing attack on the BJP, which is looking to expand its footprint in West Bengal. Speaking on the Narada tapes, she accused the centre of conspiring against the Trinamool.

""It is a communal and political conspiracy by the BJP to stop Trinamool Congress from emerging as a contender against it in national politics,"" Ms Banerjee claimed.

Interestingly, the West Bengal Chief Minister admitted that nominating industrialist KD Singh, who is said to have funded the sting, to the Rajya Sabha as a TMC candidate was a mistake.

""I thought he was a man with good credentials. But nominating KD Singh as a Rajya Sabha MP was a mistake. Sometimes, you learn from your mistakes,"" Ms Banerjee said.

Ms Banerjee also claimed that the BJP had approached a leader from her to try and split Trinamool with the promise of making him Chief Minister of West Bengal.

"Life Term For Cow Slaughter In Gujarat, Assembly Clears Tougher Law","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/life-term-for-cow-slaughter-in-gujarat-1675675","Ahmedabad:                             Punishment for cow slaughter in Gujarat will be a life term after an amended law was cleared on the last day of the state assembly session today. Gujarat, where elections will be held later this year, now has the toughest law against cow slaughter in the country.

The Gujarat Animal Preservation Act of 1954 also says the punishment for transporting of cows will be 10 years in jail.

In the current law, which was amended in 2011, the maximum jail term for cow slaughter was seven years. The new law also increases penalty from Rs. 1 lakh to 5 lakh.

The bill was passed in the absence of the opposition Congress, which had walked out on some other subject.

Over the past few weeks, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has often talked about bring in harsher laws to protect cattle. The BJP is committed to protect ""Gau (cow), Ganga and Gita"", he declared earlier this month. This was days after the ruling BJP won giant victories in state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, where the party has appointed as Chief Minister the saffron-robed Yogi Adityanath - one of its loudest cow protection campaigners.

Yogi Adityanath has also been invited to campaign in Gujarat, a move that the opposition Congress says indicates a plan to polarize voters.

The slaughter and transport of cows was banned in Gujarat in 2011, when the state was ruled by Narendra Modi, now Prime Minister.

The BJP has governed the PM's home state since 1998. As it seeks a fifth consecutive term this year, it faces the challenge of disenchantment among its former supporters the Patels over quota and anger over attacks on Dalits.

The party's slogan ""UP mein 325, Gujarat mein 150"" (325 seats in UP, 150 in Gujarat) conveys its aim to win Gujarat with a record margin, the sort it won in India's most populous state."
"'Why Should I Resign? I Delivered,' Digvijaya Singh After Sabotage Charge","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/why-should-i-resign-i-delivered-digvijaya-singh-after-sabotage-charge-1670714","NEW DELHI: HighlightsDigvijaya criticised for Congress failing to form Goa government
Take responsibility but I think have done the right thing: Digvijaya
BJP formed Goa government despite winning fewer seats than Congress
                                After a strong rebuttal to his critics within the party, Congress general secretary in-charge of Goa Digvijaya Singh on Friday told NDTV that there was no reason for him to resign for the party's inability to form the government in Goa when he had delivered on his mandate.

""I have delivered the result...Why should I resign?"" Mr Singh told NDTV when asked if he too -like party leaders have been offering to do in other states - would take responsibility for the Congress' failure to get the numbers to form the government in the state under his charge.

The senior Congress leader counted the Aam Aadmi Party's failure to get a single seat and a sharp decline in the BJP's tally from 22 in 2012 elections to 13 seats his achievement. ""We are the single largest party,"" he said.

The Congress won 17 of Goa's 40 assembly seats, just four short of the majority mark. But the BJP, which had just 13 lawmakers moved quickly to tie-up with smaller parties and staked claim to form government, getting an invitation to do so from Governor Mridula Sinha. The Congress says the governor should have first consulted it as the largest party on whether it had the numbers to form government. It has called the invite ""a murder of democracy"" and threatened to move a motion against the Governor in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA is in a minority.

Mr Singh made it clear that he wasn't fighting shy of taking responsibility for everything that happened in Goa but this didn't mean he was wrong.

""I take full responsibility but I think I have done the right thing and I stand by it others... I am not quitting,"" he said.

In a series of tweets earlier in the day, the senior Congress leader had gone public with how the party could have formed the government if his strategy to ally with the Vijay Sardesai-led Goa Forward Party before elections had been implemented. But the move was ""sabotaged"", he said, a reference that opposition from some state leaders to this tie-up. If he had had his way, Mr Singh suggested, the Congress - and not the BJP - would have formed the government.

Mr Singh had also outlined his success in improving the party's tally, something that he believes sets him apart from other leaders heading states where Congress suffered heavy losses.

Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar had offered to step down after the party's dismal performance in the assembly election; the Congress won just seven of the 105 seats contested in UP. In Odisha, the general secretary in-charge of BK Hariprasad made the offer after the Congress ended up with just 60 of the 850 seats in last month's panchayat polls."
"Demonisation, Not Demonetisation That Won In The Assembly Polls: Kapil Sibal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/demonisation-not-demonetisation-that-won-in-the-assembly-polls-kapil-sibal-1674088","New Delhi:                             Targeting the BJP government at the Centre, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Kapil Sibal on Monday said that it is ""demonisation"" and not demonetisation that succeeded (in the recent state assembly elections).

""Don't think demonetisation has succeeded. It is demonisation that has succeeded,"" Mr Sibal said during a discussion on the Finance Bill 2017 in the Rajya Sabha.

Mr Sibal's remarks came immediately after he accused Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of unjustifiably shaming the common people by saying that they evade income tax.

""The Finance Minister in his budget speech made a very passionate appeal and in fact told the people of this country that all of them are dishonest, because they don't pay taxes. He said that out of 125 crore people in this country, only 3.17 crore pay taxes,"" Mr Sibal said.

""But if you calculate, sir, there are just three crore people in this country who are able to pay taxes. And you are telling people that they are dishonest as they don't pay taxes and that's why you are unleashing this terror regime,"" he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8 last year, just months ahead of the assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP has got a thumping majority.

PM Modi had called it a step towards the fight against black money. The BJP also included issues such as Ram temple in Ayodhya, triple talaq and closure of slaughterhouses in its poll pitch.

Taking strong exception to certain amendments moved by the government in the Finance Bill, Mr Sibal said that these provisions seek to give a push to crony capitalism, weaken the federal structure of the country, allow the government to snoop on citizens and instill fear in the business community.

The Congress leader said that the Bill removes the cap on corporate funding to a political party and the new provisions do not require the donor to disclose who it donated to.

""The Bill seeks to amend Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, which requires a company to disclose any donation above Rs. 20,000. The cap of maximum donation of 7.5 per cent of the net profit of a company has also been removed. Now, not even the shareholders would know to which party the money went,"" Mr Sibal argued.

Speaking on Aadhar, he said it was meant only for streamlining the public distribution system, but the present government wants to use it for snooping on the personal lives of citizens.

He said that linking everything to Aadhar entails the risk of all the personal details of an individual being hacked by hackers, apart from the government watching every activity of citizens.

He also objected to the ""unbridled powers"" given to taxmen through an amendment, by which tax officials are not required to give any reason for searching and making seizures, not even to the appellate tribunal."
"MCD Elections 2017: AAP Gives Tickets To Those Who Helped Arvind Kejriwal In Hour Of Need","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/mcd-elections-2017-aap-gives-tickets-to-those-who-helped-arvind-kejriwal-in-hour-of-need-1673616","New Delhi:                             The Aam Aadmi Party has offered a ticket to contest elections to two people who had helped Arvind Kejriwal during his hour of need. They had offered accommodation to Mr Kejriwal while he struggled to make a foray into the political arena. AAP today, returned the favour by giving them tickets to contest the upcoming municipal or MCD elections, and the assembly by-poll.

62-year-old Naren Jain had offered Mr Kejriwal his house when he had resigned after his first stint as Delhi Chief Minister and was looking for a place where he could stay and host party volunteers. Though Mr Kejriwal could not move into Mr Jain's home due to legal reasons, the AAP today gave him a ticket to contest the MCD elections from Chandni Chowk ward, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.

The other man who helped Mr Kejriwal was 57-year-old Harjeet Singh, who had given his 41, Hanuman Road bungalow to the Aam Aadmi Party during its initial days. Mr Kejriwal took up Mr Singh's offer. In fact, the central Delhi address was used by Mr Kejriwal to file his nomination paper as a Delhi resident during the 2013 Assembly election. Mr Kejriwal is otherwise a resident of Ghaziabad, where he was residing in the government quarters allotted to his wife, formerly with the Income Tax department, at Kaushmabi.

To return the favour, the party has now given Mr Singh a ticket to contest the Rajouri Garden Assembly by-election, where polling will take place on April 9. The seat fell vacant after Jarnail Singh resigned as an Aam Aadmi Party MLA to contest the recent Punjab Assembly polls.

An ardent Kejriwal supporter, Mr Singh is believed to have charged nothing from AAP for using his bungalow. The party office was later shifted to East Patel Nagar. After his resignation as Delhi Chief Minister during his first tenure, Mr Kejriwal had stayed put in his official residence at Tilak Lane. While he planned to vacate the residence, he scouted for an accommodation which could serve not only as a home but also a place where party leaders and volunteers could be hosted. He then zeroed down on 4-B Flagstaff Road, a quiet lane on Alipur Road in north Delhi's Civil Lines area, belonging to Mr Jain, son of former Congress MP from Chandni Chowk Bhiku Ram Jain.

The plan, however, ran into trouble after Mr Jain's elder brother claimed it to be a disputed property and threatened to approach the court. Mr Kejriwal then decided against moving into the accommodation. Now Mr Kejriwal's official residence and the 4-B Flagstaff Road bungalow are separated by just one bungalow. ""I had offered my home to Mr Kejriwal but the Congress played mischief. My intentions behind giving my house to Mr Kejriwal were very noble that could not materialise,"" Mr Jain said."

""I wanted to see the people because of whose hard work the party has got such a massive win,"" the Chief Minister said. The guest list comprised senior ministers in his team and the two Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma.

""Amit Shah told me that tomorrow is the oath-taking ceremony,"" he said at the UP Yoga Mahotsav, adding he left home in Gorakhpur with just two sets of saffron robes that were handy.

At his 5 Kalidas Marg bungalow in the state capital that he had moved into earlier in the day, Yogi Adityanath, however, had a message for the BJP's war horses too. He told them that the massive win had come bundled with big responsibilities. ""Now we will have to stamp out blackmarketeering, dishonesty and corruption in the state,"" he declared.

He also pledged to raise the quality of primary education in the state. The Chief Minister added shoes as one of the facility that young school children should get from the state government, apart from school bags and uniform."
"Political Parties Spent Rs. 5,500 Crore On Uttar Pradesh Poll Campaign: Study","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/political-parties-spent-rs-5-500-crore-on-uttar-pradesh-poll-campaign-study-1670571","New Delhi:                             The Uttar Pradesh elections saw a total of over Rs. 5,500 crore spent on campaign by various parties, including about Rs. 1,000 crore towards 'note for vote', with nearly one-third voters admitting to cash or liquor offer, a survey claimed. According to the CMS pre-post poll study, more than Rs. 5,500 crore were spent by major political parties in the just-concluded assembly election in Uttar Pradesh (UP) alone.

The Election Commission of India allows Rs. 25 lakh per candidate for campaign expenditure, but it is best known secret that most candidates spend much more than what is officially allowed and what candidates declare after the poll. Campaign activities include a range of conventional and non-conventional activities. Print and electronic material, including wide screen projections, video vans and the like put together itself in this election was put at Rs. 600-900 crore. ""Every vote cast in UP involved a cost of about Rs. 750, which is highest in the country,"" the survey noted.

In the assembly elections, nearly Rs. 200 crore in Uttar Pradesh and over Rs. 100 crore in Punjab were confiscated, the report said, adding that what gets to electoral campaign pipeline is 4-5 times more than what gets confiscated by authorities.""Going by that trend, in 2017, Rs. 1,000 crore were estimated to be distributed among voters,"" it said.

The survey further noted that around 55 per cent voters sampled in Uttar Pradesh knew personally someone or the other in the neighbourhood who had actually taken money for vote in this or earlier assembly polls.

Surprisingly, the study noted that demonetisation has significantly hiked poll expenditure. ""In some constituencies where the fight was tight, the cash involved ranged between Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000 depending on the number of voters and influencing the role of a voter,"" it said.

Two-thirds of voters found that candidates spent a lot more than ever before. Some of the campaign methods adopted in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections include door-to-door, rallies, yatras, social media, advertising through television, newspapers and multi-screen projections, motor cycle rallies, langar and celebrity shows."
"Astrologers Must Not Predict Results Ahead Of Voting, Says Poll Commission","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/astrologers-must-not-predict-results-ahead-of-voting-says-poll-commission-1675525","New Delhi:                             The ban on surveys predicting election results in the 48-hour period before voting begins will, from now, extend to astrologers, the Election Commission said today. Currently, opinion polls and surveys are also banned from predicting the prospects of various parties before voting, so it does not influence voters.

But today, in a statement, the powerful election body said the prediction of results in ""any form or manner by way of predictions etc. by astrologers, tarot readers, political analysts or by any persons during the prohibited period is a violation"" of the ban that is aimed at making sure voters are not influenced.

There should be no attempts ""merely to score brownie points against competitors for commercial reasons,"" the Election Commission added.

In the absence of opinion polls ahead of the recent round of assembly elections in five states, astrologers and tarot card readers also featured in television debates. Invited to make their predictions, some of them had presented diverse scenarios.

One group of astrologers forecast that the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance would win comfortably in Uttar Pradesh, while others predicted a massive BJP victory. Each side claimed the most accurate results, citing ""authentic analysis of birth charts and horoscopes"".

Pramod Gautam, the chairman of Vedic Sutram, was quoted by IANS as saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ""clearly the winner as his stars continue to be favourable"" and this would favour the BJP. After predicting three BJP wins in the past, Mr Gautam had proved to be correct for the fourth time.

Even fortune-telling parrots have got into the act, with reports talking of one that predicted a Congress victory."
"Narada Case: Man Behind The Sting Operation That Made Mamata Banerjee See Red","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/narada-case-man-behind-the-sting-operation-that-made-mamata-banerjee-see-red-1671998","Kolkata:                             As the CBI probe into the Narada case - which has made Bengal's ruling party see red -- got a green signal from the Supreme Court, the man who conducted the sting operation for a news portal has come under the scanner. Questions have been raised about the motives of Mathew Samuel and his decision to release the tapes in March last year, just before Assembly elections in the state, two years after he had shot them. Who funded the sting that gave away nearly 80 lakh rupees is still a grey area.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court refused to give in to the Bengal government's demand and call off the CBI investigation into the case, which was ordered by the Calcutta High Court on 17 March. The top court has given the agency a month's time to come up with a report in the case, in which leaders of Trinamool were purportedly seen accepting huge wads of cash from the reporter posing as a man wanting to set up a company in Bengal and seeking favours from the government.

Mathew Samuel was a journalist with Tehelka when he conducted the sting operation back in 2014, just before the Lok Sabha elections. At the time, the owner of Tehelka was Trinamool lawmaker KD Singh.
 Questions have been raised about Mathew Samuel's decision to release Narada tapes last yearMr Samuel has reportedly claimed that Mr Singh asked for the sting report.

He has also claimed that at the time, he had no idea that Mr Singh was a lawmaker of the Trinamool Congress. He said he thought Mr Singh belonged to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, a small but powerful regional party from Jharkhand.

The Central Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the case, is investigating Mr Samuel's claims as well.

Mr Singh, who was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in 2010, joined the TMC a few months later. The businessman-turned-politician owns a private jet and a whole range of enterprises like Republic of Chicken, a popular food products outlet, and a chit fund group called Alchemist.

Mr Samuel, however, made the tapes public only in 2016, ahead of the Assembly polls, on a news portal he himself had set up, naradanews.com.  There is no clarity on why he chose that time to make them public.

The agency has searched Mathew Samuel's home in Delhi seeking papers and equipment related to the sting operation.

Mr Samuel, who was last week at a hospital at Kochi, recuperating from surgery, told NDTV that he was cooperating with the investigation. He has also welcomed the Supreme Court order today.

But KD Singh, the lawmaker of TMC, was not available for comment."

"MCD Elections: In Another Big Poll Promise, Arvind Kejriwal Says Will Abolish Residential House Tax","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ahead-of-mcd-polls-arvind-kejriwal-promises-to-abolish-residential-house-tax-1673355","New Delhi:                             Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will abolish the residential house tax and waive-off arrears if voted to power in the capital's civic bodies. His words resonated promises of cutting electricity and water bills  ahead of Delhi assembly elections which AAP swept last year.

Mr Kejriwal said that the house tax has become a ""major"" source of corruption and promised that his AAP, which is making its civic polls debut, will end it.

He vowed to transform the three civic corporations in Delhi - South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) - into ""profit-making"" bodies. NDMC and EDMC are currently grappling with financial losses.

Taking a dig at the ruling BJP, the Chief Minister said its councillors could be seen travelling on scooters before the previous MCD elections, but are now zooming around in expensive cars.

He also promised that the AAP will ensure that municipal staffers get their salaries on time. ""We will abolish the residential house tax and waive off tax arrears if AAP comes to power...the party is preparing its detailed manifesto which will be released soon,"" he told reporters here.

The residential house tax is an important source of revenue for civic bodies. Mr Kejriwal added that the commercial house tax will continue to be in place. To a question on allegations by political rivals that the AAP always announces freebies ahead of the polls, he said the Delhi government is saving money on its projects which is then spent on public welfare.

The three municipal corporations go to polls on April 23, while votes will be counted on April 26."
"Yogi Adityanath's First Speech As UP Chief Minister In Gorakhpur: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-yogi-adityanaths-first-public-speech-as-up-chief-minister-in-gorakhpur-1673436","Yogi Adityanth, who was sworn-in as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister on March 19, addressed his first public meeting as the state's chief. He addressed a rally in Gorakhpur, his hometown, where he returned nearly a week after he was appointed the Chief Minister of India's most populous state. The  BJP came to power in UP with a massive victory on March 11, when the counting of votes took place after a major five-state Assembly elections ended. Large hoardings were put up on the street in Gorakhpur for his grand welcome. Before the public function, Mr Adityanath had met his supporters, and later, district officials. The state's former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today took a jibe on the 44-year-old leader, saying ""The Chief Minister has said he is one year older than me. I say you (Adityanath) may be older in age but are far behind in terms of work."" This was Mr Yadav's retort to Mr Adityanath's jab in Lok Sabha earlier this week.

Here are the live updates of Yogi Adityanath's speech:I am thankful to the 22 crore people of UP who gave the BJP, on the insistence of the world's most popular politician PM Modi and Amit Shah, a chance to form the government.PM Modi's development programmes are being made available to all the citizens. He has entrusted me with the responsibility to make the dreams of the state true.Brain drain was a problem, businessmen were moving out, women and anganwadi workers continue their protests.PM Modi was worried how to fix things in UP, how to develop this huge state.He had laid foundation for a fertilizer company and AIIMS hospital. Now we are confident that the population of the state will not feel left out.Amit Shah has been instrumental in making the BJP the world's most important political party and popular in UP. The result is in front of us.It's not just a position for me, we are also responsible for the well-being of the state and its populace.I would request you all to thank the BJP leadership, PM Modi and hardworking members for this landslide victory.Sabka saath and sabka vikas ki raah pe chalenge.I promise and will ensure there would be no discrimination based on caste, creed or colour community.PM wants that every citizen must benefit from the schemes of the government. We all are just representatives to realise his dream.I might not be available in Gorakhpur as much as I would want to, but a solution would be provided for all the problems.We would dedicate ourselves to the service of the state.No new decisions will be taken which were not mentioned in the manifesto.We will fulfil all our promises.UP will be turned into a developed state.We need your support to make that happen.We are devoted to the state, there would be no corruption.Goondaraaj will end and there will be no place for lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh. For this, Gorakhpur has been a laboratory for such work where crime was brought down. This model will be emulated in the rest of the state. Under PM Modi's leadership, we will develop the state.We will keep coming back to you asking for your support and feedback.Safety will be guaranteed, we want your blessings and support.I am one of you and I will work for all the parts of UP, not just Gorakhpur or eastern UP.Your support will be my strength to ensure law and order, safety.Josh mein hosh na khone ki stithi aani nahi chahiye.We have formed anti-romeo sqauds destructive minds, eve-teasers will be dealt with"
"BSP Chief Mayawati To Move Court This Week Against EVM 'Tampering' In UP Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bsp-chief-mayawati-to-move-court-this-week-against-evm-tampering-in-up-polls-1671417","New Delhi:                             The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will move court in the next two-three days against the alleged tampering of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, its chief Mayawati today said. She charged that ""the BJP won elections by rigging electronic voting machines"".

Ms Mayawati had said that a 'black day' will be observed every month against what she termed the ""murder of democracy"" by the BJP.

""We will approach court over the issue in the next two-three days,"" the BSP supremo told reporters in the Parliament premises. Earlier, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had rejected Mayawati's claim that the voting machines were rigged and said her demand for a re-poll using ballot papers was legally untenable.

The BSP, which had 80 legislators in the outgoing UP Assembly, managed to win just 19 seats in the 403-member House. Driven by the Modi wave, the BJP, along with its ally, had stormed to power in UP after 14 years, securing 325 seats, while the Samajwadi Party had won 47 seats and its ally the Congress seven seats.

The former Chief Minister of UP had alleged large-scale tampering in the EVMs soon after results were announced on March 11.The Samajwadi Party and the Congress had also supported Mayawati's allegations.The BJP had ridiculed Ms Mayawati's allegations of EVM tampering and asked her to ""gracefully accept the people's mandate"".

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too had claimed that EVMs were tampered with in Punjab to keep the Aam Aadmi Party out of power."

"UP Election Results 2017 - Akhilesh Yadav's Unforced Errors Will Impact His Clout vs Father Mulayam","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-results-2017-akhilesh-yadav-and-rahul-gandhi-friends-with-absolutely-no-benefits-1668650","New Delhi: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav and Congress alliance no match for PM Modi
Father Mulayam had warned against partnering with Rahul Gandhi
Congress in Uttar Pradesh headed for less than 10 seats
                                It turns out that Akhilesh Yadav's big decisions in his attempt to stretch his political legs and stride away from his father have backfired spectacularly. The 44-year-old Chief Minister today earned the distinction of being vanquished in the BJP's biggest ever result in India's most important state. Of 403 seats, the BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is placed to win 325. Akhilesh Yadav, on the other hand, had accrued 47, with his junior partner, the Congress, proving party pooper by adding just another seven.

""I guess the new government will provide better expressways, maybe people didn't like the freeways we built, and now a bullet train will be brought for UP,"" said Akhilesh Yadav in a press conference at his residence, appearing relaxed but not abjuring sarcasm. Mayawati, who was relegated to third place, has alleged that the voting machines in UP were rigged, raising feedback of the sore loser variety. ""If a complaint has been raised, the government should look into it. I will also study this,"" he said.

He is not short of material to scrutinize. Whether entwining with the Congress was an unforced error is arguable. Akhilesh Yadav said recently that the alliance was formed when he was operating from a position of weakness, trapped in a long and public fight with his father, Mulayam Singh, for control of the Samajwadi Party. Mulayam Singh, 77, was categorical that a collaboration with any party, including the Congress, was unacceptable. Akhilesh Yadav felt differently. At a time when his party was riven by his family feud, he felt that the Congress would help consolidate the crucial Muslim vote, which accounts for 18 per cent of the population and serve as a beta blocker for the momentum generated by PM Modi.  

Oops.  

Not only did the Congress fail to pull its own weight, but it also served as an ankle-weight for Samajwadi candidates, who say the Congress' votes did not transfer to them.
 UP Election Results 2017: Akhilesh Yadav earned the distinction of being vanquished in the stateApart from counter-pointing his father, Akhilesh Yadav's predisposition to combining with the Congress was based on his famed friendship with Rahul Gandhi, who is three years older than him and is his party's No 2. Mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi left election decisions to him and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was credited publicly by the party for salvaging the alliance from busting over how many seats the Congress would be allotted. It got 105, vastly disproportionate to both its result in the last election in 2012 and its depleted stature since. As exit polls on Thursday forecast a BJP win (though only two correctly called an outright landslide), Akhilesh Yadav said, in a reversal of stand, that should the need arise, he was open to seeking an alliance with Mayawati.

The Samajwadi-Congress combine came to be etched too firmly in voters' minds as narrowly focused on the Muslims and the Yadavs and drove a consolidation of the Hindu vote for the BJP.

A month-long Kisan Yatra in September, which saw him touring the state uninterrupted, followed by joint road-shows with Akhilesh Yadav in an open-top Mercedes SUV, did not improve Rahul Gandhi's ability to connect with people or to draw mass support for the Congress. Despite that, his party has not swerved from a long tradition of sycophancy, with senior leader Digvijaya Singh today stating that ""It is not possible for Rahul Gandhi to step down. The Gandhi-Nehru family is the biggest binding factor for the Congress.""
 Akhilesh Yadav's predisposition to combining with Congress was based on his friendship with Rahul GandhiEarly this morning, before the counting of votes began, Samajwadi Party workers held a hawan to incite a victory. By then, a life-size cutout of Rahul Gandhi that had for days been placed alongside a similar representation of Akhilesh Yadav had been removed overnight. Either the cadre was venting its anger, or it was taking no chances with what it considers bad luck. Either way, it did not augur well for the Chief Minister.

Apart from the ruinous alliance with the Congress, Akhilesh Yadav will now have to inquest his decision to thrust his father into an adjunct role so close to the election. He had spoken of returning the post of President, which he hijacked with the support of thousands of party delegates, to Mulayam Singh after the election was completed. His stock within the party, so greatly enlarged during his feud with his father, with him being read as the clean, young politician trying to purge over-the-hill leaders unhesitant about mingling with criminals and dons, if needed for political gain, has taken a big hit.

""Our cycle was tubeless,"" he joked this evening of his party symbol, ""it proved impossible to pump air into its wheels"" - a bantering assessment of the damage caused by his fractious relationship with his father.

Though he himself did not shy away from promoting candidates like Gayatri Prajapati, named in multiple criminal cases including one of gang-rape, for the most part, Akhilesh Yadav enjoys public goodwill. His development of world-class highways, his focus on education for the youth is not unappreciated by the public. But it turned out to be a wimpy opponent to the currently unassailable popularity of PM Modi and his credibility as a driver of change and progress. The bicycle wobbled. His father now has a chance to advocate that's what happens when training wheels are removed too quickly."
"In Manipur, Small Parties Hold The Key To Government Formation","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-manipur-small-parties-hold-the-key-to-government-formation-1668848","Imphal:                             The National People's Party (NPP), a regional party founded by former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma will get to play king maker after the Congress and the BJP failed to get a majority in the Manipur assembly elections, results of which were announced yesterday. Largest party, the Congress, has 28 seats, three short of the 31 needed to form government in the state. The BJP has 21 and has ten short, but has made it clear it will give getting allies on board a shot.

The NNP's Conrad Sangma told NDTV today that the party's new legislators will decide by Sunday evening who they will support. ""We have fought the election alone, so we can take decision alone. Let us not discuss here, as we said let our meeting get over,"" he said, adding with a smile, ""this is a not the Congress"".

The NNP has won 4 seats in the assembly elections -- is already part of the North East Democratic Alliance or NEDA -- a front organization of anti-Congress parties stitched together by BJP chief Amit Shah after the party's victory in the Assam assembly elections last year.  So is the Naga People's Front, which won another four seats. The party, which has been livid over the Congress government's decision to carve out seven new districts -- which it says compromises the tribal lands and identity of the Nagas -- has indicated that it will support a non-Congress government.

Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, which won one seat in Manipur, is already an ally of the BJP. Mr Paswan has said his party will support the BJP in Manipur. The seat that hangs in balance has been won by an Independent.

The Congress' Okram Ibobi Singh has been Manipur's Chief Minister for 15 years straight. This time the BJP challenged him in its bid to win another state in the north east and inducted and fielded top rebels of the Congress.

On Saturday, results were announced for elections in five states. The BJP has won Uttar Pradesh by a landslide and has also swept the hill state of Uttarakhand. It is the second largest party in both Manipur and Goa, but party chief Amit Shah made it clear in his victory speech that the BJP will attempt to form government in both states."
"Punjab Election Results 2017: Just 6 Women Make It To Assembly","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-results-just-6-women-make-it-to-assembly-1668866","Chandigarh:                             Only six of the 81 contesting women candidates managed to secure a place in the 117-member Punjab Assembly. The winning candidates, three from the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) each, marked merely 5 per cent of the Assembly's strength.

Among the winners are AAP's Rupinder Kaur, who won Bathinda rural seat, Sarvjit Kaur (Jagraon) and Prof Baljinder Kaur (Talwandi Sabo) and Congress's Aruna Chaudhary (Dinanagar), Satkar Kaur (Ferozepur rural) and Razia Sultana (Malerkotla).

Among women leaders, Aruna Chaudhary won by the highest margin of 31,917 votes and Rubinder Kaur Rubu emerged victorious with the lowest vote (10,778) difference.

In the 2012 assembly polls, 14 out of the 93 nominees had made it to the House.

BSP candidate Mumtaz, a transgender, contested the elections from Buchho Mandi in Bathinda district, but lost by 1,137 votes. 

On Saturday, the Congress upturned the SAD-BJP alliance in the polls by ending 10-year regime of the Badal family. The Congress in Punjab, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, is set to return to power after a gap of a decade, decimating on its way the ruling Akalis and dashing the hopes of newbie Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The Congress won 77 seats in the 117-member Punjab Assembly. Prominent among them is Navjot Singh Sidhu, who quit the BJP to join the Congress before the elections and contested from Amritsar East. The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, which many expected to win the state, managed to bag just 23 seats. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance won merely 18 seats.

We are all now part of Modi's nation. And it's here to stay for another eight years at least because 2019 seems like a slam-dunk for the BJP. Today marks such an enormous change that the BJP brand is now being subsumed under the Modi charisma. Not a single voter that I met in UP said they were voting for the BJP. They were all voting for Modi, Modi, Modi. With this transformation comes great expectations.""

Takeaways from Saturday's massive victory for PM Modi in Uttar Pradesh, as explained by Prannoy Roy:

In fact, if you factor in an SP-Congress alliance into 2014, see how BJP has done even better this time

"Punjab Election Results 2017: Happy Birthday, Amarinder Singh. Congress Set For Comeback","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-results-2017-happy-birthday-amarinder-singh-congress-set-for-comeback-1668590","New Delhi: HighlightsCongress set to make a comeback in Punjab after 10 years
Amarinder Singh winning in stronghold Patiala, trailing in Lambi
He had announced that if he lost, it would be his last electionCaptain Amarinder Singh could not have hoped for a better 75th birthday. His party, the Congress, is making a comeback in Punjab after 10 years and he is expected to return as Chief Minister.

The Congress is set to win a huge majority in Punjab. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of Arvind Kejriwal, which had been tipped by many as the winner, is a poor second and the ruling Akali-BJP is last.

""Arvind Kejriwal is a summer storm, he came and he's gone,"" Amarinder Singh quipped about the man who had repeatedly challenged him during the campaign.

As for his party's victory, Amarinder Singh graciously credited Sonia Gandhi, who did not campaign at all, and Rahul Gandhi, who reserved much of his energies for Uttar Pradesh.

Popular as ""Captain"" among his supporters, Mr Singh had declared that this is his last election.

He said his first priority would be to fight drugs; Punjab's drug problem was depicted in the acclaimed movie ""Udta Punjab"" recently.

""The people of Punjab have given us a big mandate. I have vowed to finish drugs within four weeks,"" the Captain said.

He was non-committal on having the flamboyant cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu as his deputy.

""That will be decided by the Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi. All ministers will be decided by the party leadership,"" he said.

The Captain has not shared the warmest of ties with Mr Sidhu, who joined the Congress in January amid speculation that he was angling for the Chief Minister's post.

Mr Singh contested two seats. He has won his traditional stronghold of Patiala, but in Lambi, where he challenged Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal, he is trailing."
"SAD will review Punjab election outcome, says Parkash Singh Badal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sad-will-review-punjab-election-outcome-says-parkash-singh-badal-1668947","Chandigarh:                             The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will hold a meeting to review the party's performance in the Punjab assembly elections, said the outgoing Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal today. 

Congratulating the Congress on its victory, Mr Badal said that his party will support the new government if it works in the interest of the people and the state. The Congress, which bagged 77 of the state's 117-member Assembly seats, decimated the Akali-BJP combine, who won just 18 seats.

""We will call a meeting of the party in which we will discuss the reasons (behind the defeat in the polls),"" he told reporters after submitting his resignation to Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore in Chandigarh.

On the Sutlej-Yamuna-Link canal issue, he said that ""not single drop of water"" will be shared, as Punjab's economy depends on it. 

Responding to a question on the Congress's resolve to wipe out drug menace from the state in four weeks, the outgoing Chief Minister said, ""Whatever steps they take will come before you"". 

""The kind of development work we undertook, has never happened in the state. But if there was any deficiency or wrong propaganda launched against us, we will analyse these and then take corrective measures,"" said SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal.

He said that the SAD-BJP alliance lost the elections due to a drop in the vote share. The alliance received a 31 per cent vote share while the Congress and the AAP got 38 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, he added.

Sukhbir Singh Badal congratulated Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh on his win and said that the party will ""watch"" the new government closely.

Mr Kejriwal and his wife skipped their daily morning walk today and stayed home to watch the assembly elections results on television. The area outside the Aam Aadmi Party chief's Delhi home was decorated with hundreds of saffron, white and green balloons. A huge LED screen showed leads as they came in. Bollywood music composer AR Rahman's popular hit anthem Jai Ho blared from loud speakers. The chief minister - who spent weeks away from Delhi to campaign mostly in Punjab and also in Goa - was, it was clear, preparing for victories in both states.Within two hours, however, the scene was drastically different. Complete silence. AAP has come in a distant second in Punjab and has failed to open its account in Goa. Not a single seat yet.

In the words of Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh, he was a ""summer storm, he came and he's gone.""
 Twitter was quick to troll Mr Kejriwal.

1. Literally everyone made the same joke:
2. People couldn't stop tweeting this picture showing banners printed clearly anticipating a very different result
 
3. Someone imagined AAP supporters watching the results unfold
 
4. Another imagined how Mr Kejriwal might stop people from tuning in
 
5. Someone wondered how PM Modi might console the Delhi Chief Minister
 
6. Another wondered what Mr Kejriwal might do next
 
7. Some hoped Mr Kejriwal would focus on his 'big' promise for the capital
 
8. Music director and AAP supporter Vishal Dadlani had some sensible advice
 
9. But Anand Mahindra reminded everyone what was really important
 
The question on everyone's mind now: AAP ka kya hoga? Let us know what you think in the comments section below."

                                        Uttar Pradesh elections results 2017 is all set to declare BJP's landslide victory and PM Modi's super wave has ensured a majority government in the 403-seat state. BJP won 312 of the state's 403 seats; its allies have won 13 seats for a grand total of 325. The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance has taken a bashing at the hands of the challenger. Mayawati's BSP, which was being considered the dark horse in the elections, has failed to surprise and is at a distant third position. The BJP in the crucial assembly elections, billed as a semi-final before the 2019 national elections, has surprised the pollsters and has delivered one of its best performance in UP in decades.

Today's results will also be seen as a referendum for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's notes ban last year. PM Modi was the face of the BJP's campaign with the party choosing not to project a chief ministerial candidate and seeking votes for PM Modi's policies and development agenda.

Ruling Samajwadi Party's gamble, under Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, to partner with the Congress, spearheaded by its vice president Rahul Gandhi fell flat today.  Both parties had to face a drubbing at the hands of PM Modi-led BJP.

"Punjab Election Results 2017: As Votes Are Counted In Punjab, Congresss Amarinder Singh Turns 75","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-to-turn-75-on-poll-result-day-1668491","Chandigarh:                             Congress leader and former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh will turn 75 today, the day when the results of Punjab Assembly elections, which witnessed an intense triangular contest, will be declared.

It remains to be seen what gift is in store for the state Congress chief tomorrow, who has already announced that this was his last election.

If the Congress, which is seeking to return to power in Punjab after a hiatus of 10 years, wins, he would have two reasons to cheer.

 While the Congress veteran has been spending the last few days at his residence in Chandigarh, his hectic poll campaign schedule was followed by the release of his biography -- The People's Maharaja -- written by Chandigarh-based journalist Khushwant Singh.

Earlier this month, Amarinder had also attended the wedding of his grandson, Nirvan Singh, in Delhi.

Nirvan, a scion of the erstwhile Patiala royal family, tied the nuptial knot with Mriganka Singh, granddaughter of senior Congress leader Karan Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP and scion of Jammu and Kashmir's princely family.

The Punjab Congress chief contested from two seats, his traditional stronghold of Patiala, where he took on former Army Chief Gen. J J Singh (retd) and in Lambi against Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal."
"UP Election Results 2017: 'If You Were Rahul Gandhi, Would You Quit?' Sandeep Dikshit Responded....","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-results-2017-if-you-were-rahul-gandhi-would-you-quit-sandeep-dikshit-responded-1668587","New Delhi: HighlightsSandeep Dikshit says Congress does not build, back leaders
Is Rahul Gandhi mass leader? 'Will reserve judgement,' he said
Congress must introspect openly, that will help leaders: Dikshit
                                Sandeep Dikshit's willingness to call it like it has made him an outlier within the Congress, which picked his mother, 74-year-old Sheila Dikshit, as its candidate for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, before it allied with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. On Saturday, as the Congress was reduced to roadkill by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top-gear win in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Dikshit outlined the party's infirmities. Unlike the BJP, he said, the Congress does not invest in building leaders or backing them. He contrasted this with the BJP's early support for Mr Modi, which, he said, remained intact despite the allegations that as Chief Minister of Gujarat, he did not do enough to stop the communal riots in 2002 that seared the state, a charge rejected by the Supreme Court. ""We don't have a system to build and stand behind a leader. 2002-Modi-BJP is a great example. Modi was actually a liability for the BJP...but they stuck by Modi, gave him an opportunity, and see where he has gone,"" he said.

Mr Dikshit, 52, spoke to NDTV as it became clear that the Congress' defeat in Uttar Pradesh - despite an alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - boldfaces what the party insists on denying - that it is in the midst of its worst crisis in decades. Under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, who led the campaign against the PM in 2014, the Congress has racked up a series of huge losses. ""Would you step down now if you were Rahul Gandhi?"" NDTV's Prannoy Roy asked Mr Dikshit. Substantial pause, then - ""I'm not Rahul Gandhi.""

Mr Dikshit prefaced his comments with the acknowledgement that they are likely to irk the Congress, which brooks no argument of the quality of its Gandhi leadership. When asked if Mr Gandhi is a mass leader (all evidence suggests otherwise), he held his silence, for a bit, leaned forward, and then said, ""Can we use this election to read that? I don't know. I think I'll still reserve (my) judgement.""

Like other Congress leaders including Abhishek Manu Singhvi who appeared on NDTV today, Mr Dikshit said that it would be unfair to blame the party's debacle in India's prize state entirely on Mr Gandhi. He said the party's culture has become one of ""First, let's capture the Congress, (then) Congress will capture the votes,"" arguing that there is too much internal competition for party positions and that party managers have become more prominent and powerful than leaders with potential as vote-getters (he refused to say who this category includes within this Congress). He also said that if the Congress chooses- as it often has- to conjure a silver lining today, it will have missed the point. ""We'll be in trouble if we read this with satisfaction that we are re-nominated as the main opposition party, we will be in trouble"" he said.

He also called out the party for its ducking of transparent discussions, saying it's essential for ""systems within (an) organization to help leaders improve or build themselves."""

Mr Parsekar lost by a margin of 7,219 votes. Of the 15 results declared so far, BJP bagged 6, Congress 4, Goa Forward 2, MGP, independent and NCP one each.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which made a serious bid in the electoral politics of the coastal state, is trailing the two main contestants in all the seats.

Deputy Chief Minister Fransic D'Souza of BJP won from Mapusa constituency defeating MGP candidate Vinod Phadke by a margin of 6,806 votes.

Goa Forward candidate Vinod Palyekar defeated BJP candidate and State Minister Dayanand Mandrekar in Siolim.

Two other BJP nominees -- Pravin Zantye and Michael Lobo -- emerged victorious from Mayem and Calangute constituencies respectively.

While Mr Zantye defeated Congress rival Santosh Sawant by 4,974 votes, Lobo won by 4,460 votes against Congress candidate Joseph Sequeira.

Congress candidate Francis Silveira bagged the St Andre constituency defeating BJP's Ramrao Wagh by a margin of 5,070 votes.

MGP's Dipak Pawaskar defeated Ganesh Gaonkar of BJP by 1,169 votes in Sanvordem."

The coalition managed to win just 56 of the states 403 seats while the BJP and allies, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, scored a landslide win by claiming 325.

""No one is responsible (for the loss). We failed to convince the voters. Uttar Pradesh voted for BJP because of the promises they made. Let's see if they can fulfil the promises. We have lost earlier too, but then formed a government,"" he said.

Samajwadi Party's campaign for the polls was marked by in-fighting between two camps of the party led by Mulayam Singh and his son Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. Voices within the party have also blamed a late alliance with the Congress, opposed  by Mulayam Singh but commissioned by Akhilesh.

Akhilesh Yadav, who wrested control of the party from his father amid a bitter power tussle just weeks ahead of the polls, met party workers and leaders today, saying that the Samajwadi Party was not only a party, but an ideology, and that their ""struggle will continue.""

""You all should reach out to people and strengthen the party again. I will review party's performance and analyse the results. A meeting of all the party candidates and MLAs will be held next week after which we will devise our new strategy,"" he said."

The board will also work on the strategy for Goa and Manipur, where the Bharatiya Janata Party has propelled itself in the game of government formation, even though it has failed to get majority. The party is likely to announce the chief ministers only after Holi.

In UP, where the BJP+ has won 325 of 403 seats, Dinesh Sharma, who had charge of the BJP's membership drive in India, is said to be one of the front runners for the chief minister's post after the party's massive win on Saturday. Union minsters Manoj Sinha, Mahesh Sharma and senior BJP leader Sidharth Nath Singh are also said to be in the race.

In Uttarakhand, according to the BJP sources, possible chief ministerial candidates are Satpal Maharaj, a spiritual guru who left the Congress to join the BJP, Trivendra Singh Rawat and Prakash Pant.
 Amit Shah said election results prove that PM Modi is the most popular leader since IndependenceBJP chief Amit Shah, delivering his victory speech at the party's headquarters in Delhi on Saturday said election results prove that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the most popular leader since Independence.

""The results are very encouraging for the BJP, we are going to form government in four states - UP, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur,"" the BJP chief said, thanking voters and party workers in all five states where assembly elections were held.

He said the results were a victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the mandate would ""take the country's politics in a new direction.""      

PM Modi turned the UP contest into a test of his personal popularity and his radical notes ban to eliminate black money. The party's performance in assembly elections is seen as an endorsement of his high-risk decision last November to scrap high denomination 500 and 1,000 rupee notes.

The BJP, along with allies have left  less than a 100 seats to be shared by all other parties."
"Punjab Election Results 2017: Why Arvind Kejriwal Lost, According To Navjot Singh Sidhu, Celebrating Victory","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-results-2017-why-arvind-kejriwal-lost-according-to-navjot-singh-sidhu-celebrating-vi-1668624","New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal lost because his intention was not pure: Navjot Sidhu
He said the battle for Punjab was for 'Congress's identity and honour'
Congress is set to make a comeback in Punjab after 10 years
                                Navjot Singh Sidhu today credited his victory and his Congress party's big win in Punjab to state chief Captain Amarinder Singh, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, and launched into his characteristic stream of quotable quotes. ""I promise to Sonia Gandhi that we will sacrifice anything to restore the glory of Punjab,"" the cricketer-turned-politician told reporters.

Describing the Punjab contest as a battle for ""Congress's identity and its Pagdi (honour)"", he touched his own bright yellow pagdi or turban.

""This is the revival of the Congress. It is a beginning. The Congress will revive from here. The party will take strength from here and spread across the country,"" he added.

 The Congress has returned to power in Punjab with a huge majority, winning 77 seats in the 117 member assembly. The Akali-BJP combine, which was in power for 10 years, was reduced to number three, after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which won 22 seats.

Mr Sidhu, a former BJP MP, won the assembly election from the Amritsar-east constituency by a margin of 42,409 votes against his BJP and AAP rivals.

The popular commentator joined the Congress just days ahead of the February polls in the state and was a star campaigner along with Captain Amarinder Singh, who headed the party's campaign.

AAP was Mr Sidhu's original destination after he quit the BJP in September, upset about being sidelined and denied his Amritsar seat in the 2014 election. Mr Sidhu briefly headed his political front 'Avaaz-e-Punjab', a non-starter, before turning his focus to the Congress.

""Arvind Kejriwal lost because his niyat (intention) was not pure. He wanted everything for himself,"" Mr Sidhu said, taking a dig at the AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister, whose party suffered defeats both in Punjab and Goa.

Congress leaders spoke about a significant role for Mr Sidhu in the new government, but Amarinder Singh was non-committal, saying any such decision will be taken by Rahul Gandhi."
"With 90 Votes After 16-Year Struggle, Irom Sharmila Bows Out Of Politics","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-90-votes-after-16-year-struggle-irom-sharmila-bows-out-of-politics-1668744","Thoubal:                             Hours after Thoubal handed her just 90 votes, Manipur's Iron Lady Irom Sharmila - who conducted a 16-year hunger strike demanding the withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA --- said she would quit active politics and travel south to ""calm"" her mind. Barely 24 hours ago, the feisty activist had said she would ""try again"" in the national elections of 2019 if she lost her contest against Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh in Thoubal.

Ms Sharmila, 44, had stopped her fast last August, saying she wished to chart a new course for the agitation as the Chief Minister of the state. She also said that she wanted to get married.  It had enraged a section of the people, who had unleashed a barrage of criticism. But undeterred, she had started a new political party - the PRJA (Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance) - and held strategy sessions with political leaders including Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal.

She had even waded into a controversy, claiming that the BJP had offered her a ticket and a hefty fund for her campaign. She said she had refused.

Cash-strapped despite crowd-funding, the members of the fledgling party had campaigned on cycles. At the end of it, Ms Sharmila polled just 90 votes from Thoubal. Her opponent, three-time Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, won comfortably with a margin of 10,740 votes. Two of her party members also lost their security deposits of Rs. 10,000 each - which happens only when one fails to poll 10 per cent of the valid votes.  

Later, the activist sounded despondent. ""I am fed up with this political system. I have decided to quit active politics. I will move to south India as I need to calm my mind,"" she said.  She however, made it clear that it was not the end of her agitation against AFSPA.  ""I will continue my fight against AFSPA until and unless it is repealed. But I will fight as a social activist,"" she said.

Twitter, though, was outraged on her behalf, with many pointing out how she had deserved better."
"UP Election Results 2017: Gone, Rahul Gandhi, Gone. At Partner Akhilesh Yadav's Office, He's Not On Show","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-results-2017-gone-rahul-gandhi-gone-at-partner-akhilesh-yadavs-office-hes-not-on-show-1668546","Lucknow: HighlightsRahul Gandhi alliance partner of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
Exit polls show BJP likely to win Uttar Pradesh
Rahul Gandhi removed from publicity material at Akhilesh's office
                                A life-size cut-out of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been replaced overnight at the Samajwadi Party office in Lucknow. His replacement? Mulayam Singh, the party's 77-year-old founder, whose son Akhilesh Yadav is running for a second consecutive term as Chief Minister.

His insistence on allying with the Congress was one of the reasons for an epic war between Akhilesh Yadav and his father that placed their party dangerously close to splitting ahead of the election in Uttar Pradesh, seen as a bellwether for the national election of 2019.

They managed to reconcile- just about- in time for the campaign, and the Chief Minister conducted some public meetings accompanied by Rahul Gandhi, the 46-year-old Vice President of the Congress.

At the Samajwadi Party office, slogans that bound the two young leaders together have also disappeared.

Exit polls show the BJP ahead of the competition, some give it a strong majority, the poll of exit polls (an aggregate) gives the party 211 of 403 seats.

As the forecasts were broadcast, Akhilesh Yadav said that he was open to a new partnership with rival Mayawati, whom he displaced as Chief Minister in 2012. She has not commented on his revelation, but the BJP described it as a sign of the Samajwadi Party's ""desperation.""

The Congress, which has sequentially lost key states since the general election of 2014, has been reduced to a bit player in Uttar Pradesh; the collaboration with the Samajwadi Party which made it a junior partner helped rescue it from the sidelines to some extent."

Exit polls had predicted Congress and AAP neck in neck for top spot
AAP fails to open account in Goa
                                The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) began its day with celebrations that were not meant to be. The tricolour balloons and AR Rahman's ""Jai Ho"" blaring on loudspeakers outside chief Arvind Kejriwal's home in Delhi vanished two hours into the counting of votes for five states including Punjab and Goa, where AAP had anticipated victories. AAP workers were seen dumping brooms - the party's symbol - into the backseat of a car.

The party is at second place in Punjab and has lost every seat in Goa, where it was expecting a big bang debut.

Where it had said it would win 100 of 117 seats, AAP was struggling to cross even 22 after hours of counting.

Mr Kejriwal tweeted, ""We accept people's mandate. All volunteers worked hard. Our struggle will continue.""

By the second hour of counting of votes in five states, it was clear that AAP was done for in Punjab, the state it had hoped to rule. It was third in vote share and its biggest faces - Bhagwant Mann and Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi - lost. In Goa, it has polled only six per cent of the votes, compared t0 32 and 28 per cent for the BJP and Congress. AAP's chief ministerial candidate Elvis Gomes emerged fourth in his seat.
 AAP workers dump jhadoos after crushing disappointment in Punjab, Goa.""Today's results will set the tone for the future politics in India. It's a historic day,"" tweeted AAP leader Ashutosh in the morning. He hasn't tweeted since but told reporters, ""We are disappointed with the results. We will introspect, but for a new party, even second place is big.""

The party's national dreams have been stalled, for now. The focus, say AAP leaders, will now shift to the Delhi municipal polls.

In Punjab, where he addressed nearly 100 rallies, Mr Kejriwal was dismissed as a ""summer storm that came and went"" by Captain Amarinder Singh of the Congress, the man set to be Chief Minister.

Kumar Vishwas, asked whether the failure reflected on Mr Kejriwal, said, ""All elections are fought in his name, this doesn't mean anything on him personally.""

The party said Punjab and Goa would be a ""great learning experience"" on what went wrong for the party.

Two years ago, AAP had scored a sensational victory in Delhi, decimating rivals BJP and Congress. It also debuted in parliament by winning four seats in Punjab in 2014 - the equivalent of 33 seats."
"'Exit Polls Underestimate Us, Will Get Over 300 Seats': BJP's UP President","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exit-polls-underestimate-us-will-get-over-300-seats-bjps-up-president-1668499","Lucknow: HighlightsBJP will cross majority mark, get over 300 seats: Keshav Prasad Maurya
Mr Maurya said public support for PM Modi cuts across castes
Exit polls have predicted BJP getting 211 of 403 seats in the assembly
                                The BJP's performance in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections will exceed the simple majority predicted by exit polls and hover around the 300 mark, the party's state party chief Keshav Prasad Maurya told NDTV on Friday, hours before counting of votes for the 403-seat assembly begins.

Mr Maurya said the broad-based public support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi across castes that had delivered a landslide 71 out of 80 seats in India's most populous state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was intact, and would not only be repeated in 2017 assembly elections but in the 2019 general elections too.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he said, conceded defeat when he started talking about tying up with the BSP's Mayawati. ""The BJP believes he can tie up with his aunt, friend Rahul (Gandhi)... with whoever he wants. But the BJP is going to get such big numbers that the BSP and SP are going to be uprooted,"" he said. And you don't need to wait all day for the results. He said the message from the people will be clear by 11 a.m.

An aggregate of the poll of exit polls suggests that the BJP - which contested the election against the BSP led by Mayawati and the SP-Congress combine under Akhilesh Yadav's leadership without a chief ministerial face - has a clear edge in Uttar Pradesh.

The state BJP president said his confidence didn't stem from the exit poll results but on the strength of the party's 1.4 lakh polling booth-level committees and the hard work put in by party workers over the last 10 months. The Lok Sabha member from the Phulpur seat - that was once represented by Jawaharlal Nehru - was elevated as state party unit chief in April last year, a surprise decision that was calculated to reach out to non-Yadav OBCs in the state.

It is a strategy that some experts believe may have delivered dividends for the BJP. Mr Maurya insists the appeal of PM Modi - who he called the messiah of the poor - cuts across caste divisions by the SP, BSP and the Congress."

Briefing them about the election guidelines, the meeting discussed the implementation of the model code of conduct, scrutinising advertisement by political parties, media monitoring, expenditure monitoring, maintenance of shadow observation register and permission for conduct of public rallies, an official spokesman said today.

Asking the political parties to cooperate with state administration to ensure free and fair elections, Mr Lone advised the parties to avoid defamatory personal remarks or provocative statements, which could initiate an official enquiry. 

Stressing on strict implementation of the election panel guidelines, he asked contesting candidates to open separate bank accounts for election expenditure. The meeting also discussed the designation of polling stations and participants were asked to file objections, if any, by March 13.

On March 9, the Election Commission (EC) announced the schedule for by-elections to three parliamentary and 12 assembly constituencies.

By-polls to Srinagar and Anantnag Lok Sabha constituencies in Kashmir would be held on April 9 and 12, respectively.

The Anantnag seat fell vacant in June last after Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti won the assembly elections and resigned from the Lok Sabha.

The Srinagar Lok Sabha seat was vacated by former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Tariq Hamid Karra who had resigned in protest against alleged ""brutalities"" on protesters in the Valley.

By-polls in Radhakrishnan Nagar, Tamil Nadu, which fell vacant after the demise of then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa will also be held on 12 April.

He had also been the state president of the party till he was replaced ahead of the assembly elections by Keshav Pradhan Maurya.

Early leads have showed that the BJP is heading for a massive victory in Uttar Pradesh. If the trends continue, the party may win more than 250 of the state's 403 seats in an election that's billed as the dress rehearsal for the 2019 general elections. Currently it is ahead in 238 of the 340 seats for which leads have come in.

In Uttarakhand too, the BJP is leading in 52 seats -- a gain of 24 from the last time. In the 70-member assembly, a party needs 36 seats to form the government.

Celebrations have started at the BJP headquarters after the early trends made its lead in the two states clear. The party is also expecting good news from Goa, where it is neck and neck with the Congress.

""The BJP has emerged as the most inclusive party and inspired the voters to rise above the traditional feudal mindset of parties in the state. With kind of support he enjoys, PM Modi has become a rallying point for the party across the country,"" said Union Minister Jitendra Singh.

The only state where it is trailing is Punjab, where the Congress is so far in the leading, with Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party at its heels."

The party won 17 seats, and the BJP trailed with 13 in the 40-member assembly. Nine seats went to the others - three for the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP, three for the Goa Forward Party and 3 Independents - who will hold the key to government formation in the state.

The MGP -- which is part of an alliance with the Shiv Sena and the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM -- had broken its alliance with the BJP in January. The Shiv Sena, whose chief Uddhav Thackeray said he would not enter any alliance with the BJP again.

Exit polls had predicted that the BJP could retain Goa. Three out of four exit polls did not rule out a majority for the party and only one predicted a hung house. The aggregate gave the BJP 18 of the state's 40 seats.

But by the afternoon, the party's setback became apparent. BJP Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost to Congress rival Dayanand Sopte from Goa's Mandrem constituency.

Party chief Amit Shah, however, said, ""The results are very encouraging for the BJP, we are going to form government in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur"".

The Congress government of Digambar Kamat had lost the state in 2012 -- trailing the BJP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party combine with only nine seats. The BJP had won 21 seats and the MGP three, which added up to a comfortable majority.

Today, Mr Kamat, who won from Margao constituency, credited the workers for the victory.

""The BJP-led government tried to harass me. They filed fake cases against me. They tried to jail me. Only God protected me,"" the 63-year-old leader told reporters after beating his BJP rival by over 4,000 votes. Mr Kamat had been booked by Goa Crime Branch in the multi-crore Louis bribery case in 2015.

                                The Congress, which is set to lose heavily in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as per early trends, will have some consolation -- leads in Goa and Manipur, besides the big victory in Punjab. The party is ahead in 11 seats, the state's ruling BJP is ahead in eight showed trends at 10:30 am. The situation, though, could change since trends have come in only from 23 of the state's 40 seats.  

In Goa's in Mandrem constituency, BJP Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost to Congress rival Dayanand Sopte.

Exit polls had predicted that the BJP could retain Goa. Three out of four exit polls did not rule out a majority for the party and only one predicted a hung house. The aggregate gave the BJP 18 of the state's 40 seats.
 Goa election results 2017: People wait patiently at the counting centre in the state.The Congress had lost the state to BJP in the 2012 elections, trailing the BJP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party combine with only nine seats. The BJP had won 21 seats, the MGP three, which added up to a comfortable majority. But in January, the MGP had withdrawn support from the government and went ahead to form an alliance with Shiv Sena and the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM.

Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which contested from Goa in an effort to expand its footprint beyond Delhi but was portrayed as an outsider by both the BJP and the Congress, is yet to open an account.

Claiming that he is still ""hopeful"", senior AAP leader Somnath Bharti said, ""Punjab and Goa could be a great learning experience on what went wrong... But the clear advantage would be that after the BJP and Congress, we would be a party with a footprint in more than two states."""
"Goa Election Results 2017: Counting Begins","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-assembly-election-result-2017-counting-begins-1668549","Panaji:                             The counting of votes for all 40 constituencies of the Goa Assembly began at 8 am today at two centres in Panaji and Margao.

The focus is on whether the BJP will be able to retain power and if it gets a fresh mandate, will Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar return to his home state as chief minister.

The fate of Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, whose Mandrem constituency will be taken up for counting during the first round, will be decided within the first hour of the counting.

The postal ballots and votes polled by service voters will be taken up first before calculating the numbers on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).

Tight security arrangements have been made with over 1,000 policemen deployed.

Election officials said the counting will be completed by 2.30 PM.

The votes for 19 constituencies will be counted at Panaji in North Goa, while the tally for the remaining 21 will be carried out in Margao in South Goa.

The elections held on February 4 witnessed an enthusiastic response of voters, with polling clocking in at 83 per cent.

The election has five former chief ministers besides the incumbent CM in the fray.

The Congress, the prime opponent of the BJP, has fielded four former chief ministers -- Digambar Kamat, Pratapsinh Rane, Ravi Naik and Luizinho Faleiro in their respective constituencies, while the NCP has given a ticket to Churchill Alemao.

The main fight expected to be between the Congress and the BJP, while the AAP has also put up a spirited fight on 39 seats.

The BJP has fielded 36 candidates, supporting Independents in Benaulim, Navelim, Priol and Velim. The Congress has candidates on 37 seats and has extended support to United Goans' Atanasio Monserratte in Panaji, Goa Forward's Vinod Palyekar in Siolim and Independent candidate Rohan Khaunte in Porvorim constituencies.

The BJP's major worry is an alliance between the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, the Shiv Sena and Rebel RSS leader Subhash Velingkar-led Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM).

In the 2012 assembly election, the BJP had won a majority with 21 seats followed by the Congress which had got nine seats, MGP three, Goa Vikas Party (2) while five Independent legislators were elected.

"Manipur Election Results 2017: Thoubal Gave Only 90 Votes To Irom Sharmila","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-election-results-2017-thoubal-gave-only-51-votes-to-irom-sharmila-1668597","Thoubal: HighlightsIrom Sharmila took on Okram Ibobi Singh from Manipur's Thoubal seat
She lost with a record margin, got only 90 votes
Congress Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh won by 10,470 votes
                                Manipur is not happy with Irom Sharmila. The 'Iron Lady' who had taken on Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, has lost with a record margin, polling only 90 votes. The three-time Chief Minister won comfortably with a margin of 10,740 votes. Ms Sharmila's chance of securing a seat in the 70-member assembly now rests on Khurai, the other seat from where she is contesting.

The 44-year-old rights activist had faced the anger of the people after she stopped her 16-year fast last year against the Armed Forces' Special Powers Act or AFSPA. She said she wanted to take the political route and become the Chief Minister to continue her agitation.

Her fledgling party, PRJA (Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance), had the support of the Left and Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party. But her claims had failed to convince a large section of people who earlier supported her.  Mr Kejriwal's own party has failed to open account in Goa and is leading in only 25 seats in Punjab.

On the eve of counting in Manipur, Ms Sharmila said if defeated, she would try again -- in the 2019 national election. ""I do not feel much affected by the result because people are yet to be given a chance... Everybody knows muscle and money power are openly used,"" she had said.

But she had added that the locals in Thoubal had been happy about her decision and wished to see a change.

The BJP, which, Ms Sharmila said, had offered to finance her campaign with Central funds, is trailing in the state, show early trends. While the Congress is ahead in 22 seats, the BJP is ahead in 17, show trends at 1pm."
"Election Results 2017: BJP Sweeps Uttarakhand, Chief Minister Harish Rawat Says Blame Me","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-sweeps-uttarakhand-chief-minister-harish-rawat-says-blame-me-1668793","Dehradun:                             The BJP swept the assembly elections in the hill state of Uttarakhand bagging 56 of the 70 seats with a 46 per cent vote share including two seats contested by Chief Minister Harish Rawat of the Congress who has lost his job for the second time in about a year and some political capital within the party.

The Congress won just 11 seats out of the 69 seats declared, down from its 2012 tally of 32 seats when it had formed the government with support from the Bahujan Samaj Party.  The Election Commission is yet to announce results for the Lohaghat seat, where one electronic voting machine conked out during counting. A repoll has been slated for next Wednesday for 500-odd voters served by this machine. The BJP was leading, but by a slender margin of 148 votes.

Mr Rawat had first lost the chief minister's chair last March when the Centre imposed President's rule when he was battling a rebellion within the party but was reinstated on the intervention of the Supreme Court that ruled he should have got a chance to face the trust vote in the assembly. He won the battle, but it seems, was losing the plot. Many legislators including Vijay Bahuguna, who he had replaced in 2014, switched sides and joined the BJP which had fielded them.

It didn't help that the Congress campaign in the state seemed to center around Mr Rawat - one video even projected him as Baahubali, the young hero of the blockbuster 2015 movie - who had been the target of sting operations that appeared to show him in poor light. And he was neither a match for the BJP's concerted campaign that attacked his administration for corruption nor was the Congress able to match the long list of BJP's star campaigners that also had Prime Minster Narendra Modi.

""Modi-ji's management and Amit Shah's management on the ground are visible today,"" BJP national secretary TS Rawat said.

But on Saturday the outgoing chief minister seemed prepared for the big loss. Three exit polls had forecast a landslide victory for the BJP, the fourth said the two were neck-and-neck. The aggregate - the poll of exit polls - showed that the BJP will win the state with 42 seats. Appearing before the cameras after the drubbing, Mr Rawat owned responsibility for the ""poor"" show, attributing the Congress being decimated to ""flaws in his own leadership""."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: A 360 Degree View Of BJP's Landslide Win","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-a-360-degree-view-of-bjps-landslide-win-1668768","(Here is a 360 degree view of the celebrations taking place outside the BJP office in Lucknow)

The BJP had learnt many lessons from its 2015 debacle in the Bihar assembly elections. One of them was not to celebrate too soon, and wait for the election trends to stabilise. Today, as a small group of workers came in early at the party's Lucknow office, there were no advance deliveries of flowers or sweets.

And then, the results started trickling in. As the spread and margin of the BJP's spectacular victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections started sinking in, the crowds started swelling, getting louder and colourful. The BJP needed 202 seats to come to power in the 403-seat assembly. It ended up with a landslide score of 312. But as the trend became clearer towards noon, people brought in the sweets, flowers and colours. It was Holi two days in advance -- workers danced to victory slogans, hugged each other and sprayed each other with colours as the party's gains seemed irreversible.

""Uttar Pradesh has fulfilled our dream of 300 seats this time,"" declared Keshav Prasad Maurya, the state party chief who got the job just 11 months ago. Soon, his face too was smeared with colour by jubilant party workers.

Less than 3 km away, outside the Samajwadi Party office, party workers had removed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's cut-outs from outside the party office well before the counting started. Later Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav insisted the alliance would survive the crash landing. For a long time, small groups of party workers who had gathered spoke with hope how the trends could change. Others trooped to the temple down the road.

A few hours later, they gave up. The writing was on the wall.

By the evening, the BJP had won 312 seats and a 39 per cent vote, just three percentage points less than 2014 general elections' 42 per cent vote share when the party had netted 71 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats.

The office of the Congress, which conceded that its organisational structure in the state was in shambles, wore a deserted look through the day. Ditto the BSP office that ended in the third place, after the BJP and the SP.

But if the BJP's one-step-at-a-time approach ensured it did not trip during either the campaign, or the celebrations, the AAP seemed to trip in the all guns blazing style. It repeated the BJP's mistake in Bihar, possibly encouraged by the exit polls that forecast it was within striking distance in Punjab.

Before the counting started, enthusiastic party workers had gathered outside Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's home. The venue was decorated with rows of green, saffron and white balloons and LED screens installed to keep the crowds informed about the good news as it comes. And then there was a stack of brooms, the party's election symbol that could be waved for the cameras. AAP did end up as the second largest party in Punjab - a distant second. Late in the evening, the brooms were quietly packed up and taken away."

                                        After a month-long fiercely fought election campaign, voting has wrapped up in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand. Results will be declared on Saturday, March 11. In Uttar Pradesh, which voted in seven phases, there's an intense three-way battle between the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, the BJP and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party. Punjab too will see a tough fight as the Congress and the debutant Aam Aadmi Party will try to wrest control from the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance. In Manipur, the BJP is trying hard to end the 15-year-long rule of Congress's Okram Ibobi Singh and in Uttarakhand it is hoping to unseat the ruling Congress government of Chief Minister Harish Rawat. In Goa, where the BJP is in power, the party is engaged in a fight with the opposition Congress, AAP and an alliance of MGP, Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch for the 40-member House.

Counting of votes for 117 assembly seats, which could witness a neck-and-neck fight between Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress, will begin from 8 am at 54 centres in 27 locations, said a spokesman from the election office. Live election results will also be telecast on TV screens at district election offices, prominent public places and malls.

                                        The Congress has emerged as the largest party in Goa, ahead of the BJP, that has ruled the state for five years. Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, who lost even in his own seat, resigned after it was clear that the BJP would fall well short of the halfway-mark in the 40-member Assembly. Mr Parsekar became Chief Minister after Manohar Parrikar was moved to the centre as Defence Minister in November 2014. The three main leaders of the Congress, said to be the party's top chief ministerial candidates - Luizinho Faleiro, Pratapsingh Rane and Digambar Kamat - won in their constituencies. But perhaps it was the Aam Aadmi Party that suffered the worst shock. It didn't win a single seat on its debut in the popular holiday state, despite predictions. Arvind Kejriwal and top AAP leaders had campaigned extensively here for months. With all the votes counted it remained undecided who will form Goa's next government.

"So In 2019, It Will Be Modi Versus The Rest","http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/so-in-2019-it-will-be-modi-versus-the-rest-1668358","The spectacular victory of the BJP in the present round of assembly elections has raised existential questions for several of its opponents. The Congress has managed to save its face somehow by winning Punjab convincingly and Goa by a whisker, while the outcome of Manipur is still wide open. But the thrashing received by the party in UP can hardly be compensated with a few consolation prizes. Rahul Gandhi can try to evade responsibility for the washout in UP by claiming that the Congress was the junior partner in the Alliance, but from all accounts, the Samajwadi Party was dragged down by the Congress and not the other way around. It is being universally argued that Akhilesh Yadav would have done better to go it alone. Unlike UP, the Congress has nobody to blame for its rout in Uttarakhand, where Chief Minister Harish Rawat himself lost from both the seats he contested.

Apart from the Congress, whose steady decline as a national alternative to the BJP has been clear for some time, the unexpected collapse of the BSP in UP and the failure of the Aam Aadmi Party to make a breakthrough in Punjab raise serious questions for the leadership of both these parties. 
Mayawati chose to ignore the fact that she was skating on thin ice for some years; her inability to widen the social base of the BSP would eventually lead to her party's decimation. She was also unprepared for the BJP's aggressive outreach to the Dalits whom she regarded as her permanent captives. This outreach was different from Rahul Gandhi's periodic forays into Dalit hutments and photo-ops over pre-arranged dinners. Amit Shah's outreach, on the other hand, was systematic and sustained. With the BJP/RSS cadre directed to make and maintain regular touch with non-Jatav Dalits, Mayawati's policy of talking down to her supporters increasingly gave offence even to her core followers. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it was apparent that a large segment of Dalits had voted for Modi's cross-caste appeal. But this was dismissed by the BSP leadership as a one-off phenomenon, blaming the partial desertion by a section of Dalits on the mesmerizing effect of Narendra Modi. But nobody expected this effect to spill over into the assembly polls.

Clearly, the erosion of the BSP's citadel has begun. The BJP's highly publicized delivery of pro-poor benefits such as LPG cylinders under the Ujjwala scheme has endeared the party even to those sections that hitherto considered the BJP ""untouchable"". Over the next few years, BJP governments in Delhi and Lucknow will surely consolidate their electoral base through effective delivery of promises made. By the time the 2019 Lok Sabha polls arrive, the BSP may find to its dismay that its enire Dalit constituency has been swept away by the BJP.

The present round of assembly elections and their results marks a paradigm shift in India's political idiom. For decades, the Congress has been regarded as a left-of-centre, pro-poor party which authored a slew of economic reforms aimed at subsidizing the underprivileged. During all this time, the BJP was seen as a right-of-centre party, favouring industrialists and the upper middle class. Since coming to power in April 2014, the BJP government under Narendra Modi has transformed the party's image almost completely and successfully projected itself as a welfarist party committed to the social and economic upliftment of the underprivileged. This metamorphosis of its image has enabled the BJP to redraw the ideological contours of India's politics, as evident from the assembly election results.

Much to the bewilderment of economic and political pundits, the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes added to the BJP's popular appeal. All those who travelled across rural areas of poll-bound states, especially UP, (including this writer) discovered that the rural poor believed that holders of black money and other economically affluent sections were the worst hit by demonetization. The difficulty faced by the poor was brushed aside as temporary inconvenience for a larger cause for the greater good of society. Thus, the demonetization gambit reinforced Modi's image as a crusader for the poor and against the corrupt. That most opposition parties bitterly opposed ""notebandi"" worked against them. It was widely perceived that they were against demonetization only because they were inconvenienced by the loss of ill-gotten resources. Hereafter it will be nearly impossible to dislodge Modi from the pedestal of Messiah of the poor, the same way as Indira Gandhi acquired this aura following bank nationalization and the abolition of privy purses.

The noticeable aspect of the present election results is that more than the major parties, it is the regional outfits which are facing decimation. The BSP's base seems destined to slowly wither away unless something dramatic happens. As for AAP, the absence of major corruption scandals in the Modi regime has robbed the party of its principal plank. The Samajwadi Party may recover some of its lost ground in the years to come, but it will have to steadfastly rebuild itself on planks other than caste/community coalitions. A substantial section of younger Yadavs aspiring to reach the top layers of an India in transformation voted for the BJP this time. If Modi can continue to deliver at this rate, it will deal a body blow to the politics of identity in the coming years.

Arguably, the BJP could not wipe the slate clean. The Akalis' misgovernance was a huge drag which cost the BJP a great amount of goodwill in Punjab. But this should be an eye-opener about the quality of alliances the BJP gets into; already the Shiv Sena is posing considerable challenges to the Maharashtra government. The BJP must also be prepared for most opposition parties banding together as a Grand Alliance to defeat Modi in 2019. But if the ideological and idiomatic shift of politics, as witnessed in the present round of assembly elections holds good, a Modi Versus The Rest showdown in 2019 will be to the BJP's advantage, for it will be presented as a contest between the Old, Conservative Order versus the Young, Aspirational India. No guessing then as to which side electoral fortunes will favour.

"Exit Polls May Prove Wrong - But On Modi, They're Clear","http://www.ndtv.com/blog/exit-polls-may-prove-wrong-but-on-modi-theyre-clear-1668419","Whatever else the exit polls may or may not say, they do confirm the big election story - that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has almost single-handedly lifted the BJP in Uttar Pradesh from the depths of despair to one where they are predicted to win outright or at least emerge as the largest single party. In doing so, he has not only established himself as campaigner-par-excellence but politically put to bed any adverse impact of demonetization. And if those polls that project huge majorities in UP, Uttarakhand and even Manipur turn out to be correct, then the political landscape will have changed dramatically.

While this euphoria over the forecast of a BJP sweep, except in Punjab, may have those on Twitter celebrating, the political class itself remains much more circumspect. Even BJP leaders are not popping the champagne, as memories of Bihar's exit polls being completely wrong still linger in their minds. And if you look at the gamut of predictions for tomorrow, it is obvious that some, many, or may be all  pollsters could be wrong.

Take UP, the state steals the limelight in these elections, because of its political weight. If you plot the predictions of the BJP vote and seats (see chart below) you will find that most of them have coalesced around 33% vote share and anything between 165-200 seats.Two of them have, however, proclaimed big majorities for the BJP. Of these, the News 24 Chanakya poll gives the BJP almost the same vote share as the 2014 Lok Sabha election, but trims their seats by 50 for a final count of 285. This is almost the result that would come about if you took the 2014 Lok Sabha data by assembly segments and introduced the SP-INC alliance, making it a three-cornered fight. In other words, News24 is saying that the Modi Wave of 2014 holds good in 2017. While that may be true of the later of seven phases of voting, the BJP and its supporters all admit that in the first two phases, where 140 seats were decided, the BJP under-performed considerably as compared to 2014.

Some polling also shows that Muslim consolidation around the SP-Congress could possibly have triggered a Hindu consolidation around the BJP especially in the later phases of voting. In 2014, the BJP swept eastern UP, so such a scenario remains possible. If you don't buy the consolidation of votes and so exclude the News24 projections as an outlier, then the poll of polls changes, though it continues to show the BJP well ahead but just under a majority:The other concern for the BJP would be that almost all polls have shown their vote share in UP dropping to 32-36% from 43% in 2014. That is a greater drop than happened in Bihar, and again reflects the purported early setbacks. Similarly, the SP-Congress should be very disappointed that their vote share has hardly moved from 2014 - it has declined by 6% compared to what both parties polled together in 2012. And this probably reflects the reality on the ground, where SP leaders felt that Congress votes did not transfer to them.If the polls are correct, the Congress in particular has much to be unhappy about. If all the worst-case scenarios play out for the Congress: losing Punjab, a thumping in Uttarakhand, no comeback in Goa and possibly losing Manipur, Saturday could be a very bleak day for the party.The tragedy for the Congress in Punjab is that if they win, it will be because of Captain Amarinder Singh, and if they fail to get a majority, the Captain has said he plans to retire, so the Congress will be left rudderless. Similarly, not winning in Goa will shows its inability to win against incumbency (the BJP governs the state) and losing Manipur will underscore the growing strength of the BJP in the North East.

The exit polls in Punjab also reflect two other trends: the collapse of the Akalis and with them, the BJP, is reflected in all the polls; and the continued growth of AAP shows that 2014 was not a flash in the pan and they are emerging as a major national player.If AAP wins Punjab, as some polls indicate, then not only will the Congress be worried, having lost to them heavily in Delhi, so will the BJP, whom they plan to challenge in Gujarat later this year.

In less than 12 hours, the actual results will start coming in, and many exit poll predictions will be proved wrong. Wrong, because polling isn't a science: it is a projection from a sample. The problem is that in homogenous countries, it is easier to project from small samples, but in places like UP, where more than hundreds of sub-castes exist and caste-wise voting is often the case, pollsters face the enormously difficult job of choosing their samples correctly. Now if you launch such polls across seven diverse phases, the chances of being wrong increase. 

The Trump victory in the US elections highlighted the fact that small samples cannot capture the voting variations by region and other demographics. The US election also saw a lot of people who did not admit that they were voting for Trump. Similar trends have affected Indian pollsters for many years - so take the polls with a pinch of salt. They are indicators of a pattern, or a trend, and the  ""trend"" seems to be heading BJP's way, but whether these trends convert to a sweep is a more difficult call.

"Assembly Elections 2017: BJP Parliamentary Board To Discuss Future Strategy On Saturday","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-elections-2017-bjp-parliamentary-board-to-discuss-future-strategy-on-saturday-1668282","New Delhi:                             The Bharatiya Janata Party's parliamentary board, the highest decision-making body of the political party, is likely to meet on Saturday afternoon, March 11, after assembly elections results 2017 for five states are declared.

The parliamentary board is expected to take stock of the situation and chalk out future strategy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah are among the board's 12 members. Other members include union ministers Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Ananth Kumar, Thawar Chand Gehlot and J P Nadda. 

The meeting has been tentatively scheduled for Saturday, said a party source. However, the meeting may be postponed to Sunday, depending on how the election results pan out.

On Thursday evening, the exit polls projected a good performance by the party in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The party also appears to have retained its position in Goa. 

Manipur, on the other hand, seems indecisive with one poll reflecting Congress winning the state while another projects BJP as the front-runner. In Punjab, two polls forecast a tie between the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), while one puts AAP in the lead. However, the Akali-BJP incumbent alliance has not fared well.

Though the exit polls predict a happy ending for the party, please remember, predictions can often go wrong. The counting of votes will start on Saturday morning.

The election results will give critics a window to measure Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and his chances of reclaiming a second term in 2019.

"Goa Elections 2017: BJP Will Retain The State, Say 3 Exit Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-elections-2017-bjp-will-retain-the-state-say-3-exit-polls-1668080","New Delhi:                             The poll of exit polls indicates that the BJP is likely to retain Goa again. The party is way ahead of the Congress, with 18 of the state's 40 seats. Three of the four surveys -- which were averaged by the poll of exit polls -- did not rule out a majority for the party. The ABP News-Lokniti predicted that the BJP will win 16 to 22 seats, India Today-Axis polls said 18 to 22 and India TV-C Voter gave a figure of 18 to 21. To cross the halfway mark, the BJP needs 21 seats - exactly the number it won in 2012. India News MRC said the party could win 15 seats and the Congress 10.

The poll of exit polls said the Congress -- which won 9 seats in the 2012 elections -- is likely to win 12 seats this time. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which entered the fray in Goa with high hopes after its sweep in Delhi, is likely to win 3 seats.

In absence of an outright majority, the role of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP can be crucial. The MGP, a BJP ally which won three seats last time, withdrew its support to the government in January after Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar sacked two of its ministers.

The party has since formed an alliance with the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM and Shiv Sena, which has declared it won't enter into an alliance with the BJP again.

The state, which went to polls on February 4, had a record-breaking turnout of 83 per cent. The counting of votes will take place on March 11.  

Health Warning: Exit polls can often get it wrong."
"Goa Election Results 2017: Will BJP Return For A Second-Term?","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-election-results-2017-will-bjp-return-for-a-second-term-1668454","New Delhi:                             With exit polls predicting a second-term for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Goa, all eyes are set on the election results scheduled to be declared tomorrow, March 11. Three out of the four exit polls predicted a majority for the party in the 40-member assembly, with just one indicating a hung house.  

The BJP had fielded 36 candidates and also supported independent candidates in remaining four seats. If the party misses majority, it may form an alliance with Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP). 

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar led the party's campaign in Goa. BJP chief Amit Shah had earlier hinted that the new government could work under the leadership of Mr Parrikar, fueling speculation of his return to state politics. 

Mr Parrikar, who became the Chief Minister of Goa in 2012, was later elevated to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet in 2014. Laxmikant Parsekar succeeded as the state's Chief Minister.

The Congress fielded 37 candidates and backed candidates of its associates in the remaining three seats. Senior party leaders Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digambar Kamat led the election campaign in the state.

According to the exit polls, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is making a debut in the state, is expected to win just three seats in the assembly elections. It also predicted a big win for BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. However, please remember, exit polls predictions are known for going wide off the mark. 

The counting for all the five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - will begin at 7 am."

None of the exit polls show the BSP winning a seat
2012 elections had hung assembly, with Congress winning 32 and BJP 31Two out of five exit polls show the BJP scoring a big win in Uttarakhand, two shows the party ahead while one shows a repeat of 2012, when the party was neck and neck with the Congress. A poll of exit polls averages these surveys to show the BJP winning comfortably with 42 of the hill states 70 assembly seats, with the Congress winning 24.  

A party needs to get 36 seats to form government.

The News24-Today's Chanakya survey gives the BJP a huge majority at 53 seats, while the India Today Axis exit poll says the party will get 46 to 53. India News-MRC shows the BJP at 38 and the Congress at 30. ABP Lokniti predicts the BJP will get between 34-42, Congress 23-29 and others 3-9.

The India TV-C-Voter poll however shows both parties getting 29-35 each, with other parties wining 2-9 seats, crucial if there is a hung house.

The 2012 elections had thrown up a hung assembly, with the Congress winning 32 seats and the BJP 31. The Congress was helped by Mayawati's BSP, Independents and others to cross the majority mark.  

None of the exit polls today show the BSP or Bahujan Samaj Party winning a seat in Uttarakhand. In 2012 the BSP had won three seats and those legislators had helped Congress Chief Minister Harish Rawat survive a trust vote last year after a number of his party's legislators rebelled against him.

Several key Congress leaders had joined the BJP ahead of the Uttarakhand elections and the BJP had to fight internal unrest for choosing to field its new imports as candidates over those who have been in the party for a number of years.  

Exit polls, of course, often get it wrong and the actual results will only be known on Saturday, March 11, when votes are counted in Uttarakhand and four other states, including giant neighbour UP."

The poll of exit polls today said it is very likely to succeed. Three of the four exit polls did not rule out a majority for the party. Only one predicted a hung house. 

The poll of exit polls said the Congress, which trailed the BJP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party combine with only 9 seats, is likely to increase its tally to 12.

Arvind Kejriwal's AAP -- which entered the fray in Goa with high hopes but has been portrayed as an outsider by both BJP and the Congress, is likely to win 3 seats.

If the BJP misses the majority, the role of its former ally MGP can be crucial. After withdrawing its support to the government in January, the party has entered an alliance with the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM and Shiv Sena. Last month, the Shiv Sena had announced that it won't enter into an alliance with the BJP again.

While exit polls are known for going wide off the mark, whether they got it right this time can be known on Saturday, March 11. From 7 am, the votes for all the states that went to polls - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - will be counted.

15 counting centres have been made with adequate deployment of security personnel around them as per specifications of the Election Commission of India, Chief Electoral Officer Radha Raturi said.

There are a total of 70 assembly seats in the state which are all being contested by the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP.

The EVMs will unseal the fate of 637 candidates bearing allegiance to different political parties and independents.

Considering the large number of Congress turncoats trying their luck this time as BJP candidates it will be interesting to watch out for what happens in about a dozen seats from where they are in the fray.

Narendranagar, Roorkee, Khanpur, Bajpur, Kedarnath, Sitarganj, Kotdwar are some of the high profile seats from where Congress turncoats or their protgs are in the fray.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat is trying his luck from two seats of Kichcha in Udhamsingh Nagar district and Haridwar (rural) in Haridwar district.

"Manipur Elections 2017: Congress Ahead, Shows Poll Of Exit Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-congress-ahead-shows-poll-of-exit-polls-1668020","New Delhi:                             The Congress is likely to be marginally ahead of BJP in Manipur, a state it ruled for three straight terms, a poll of exit polls shows at 7 pm. Neither party is likely to get outright majority in the state's 60-member assembly, shows the poll of exit polls, which averages the surveys by the India TV-C Voter and India Today-Axis.  The poll of exit polls predicts 26 seats will go to the Congress and 24 to the BJP in the state's 60-seat assembly, where the halfway mark is at 30.

The India-TV-C Voter poll predicts the BJP will win 25 to 31 seats -- the upper end giving the party a clear majority. The Congress, it says, will trail with 17 to 23 seats.

The India Today-Axis survey gives the Congress 30 to 36 seats and the BJP between 16 and 22 seats.

Last year, the BJP had opened its account in the north-east by sweeping the assembly elections in Assam along with its allies. In the process, it ended the 15-year rule of Congress led by Tarun Gogoi.

The party won a whopping 86 of Assam's 126 seats - a victory powered by strategic acquisitions of local leaders disenchanted with the Congress.

In Manipur too, the Congress has been in power for three terms -- its government led by Chief Minister Ibobi Singh. But over the last six months, in a pattern similar to Assam, many of top Congress leaders have shifted to the BJP. Most of them belong to the Kuki tribe -- traditionally a Congress support base -- who control the hill areas.

Chief Minister Ibobi Singh tried to win back their loyalty, but his damage control measure - bifurcation of seven districts said to be for administrative convenience - has only alienated the Nagas.

The results of the two-phase polls which ended on March 8 will be declared on March 11.

Exit Polls Have Bad News For Congress","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-election-results-2017-congress-and-bjp-hope-to-win-big-1668443","Dehradun:                             With results of Uttarakhand assembly election all set to be declared tomorrow, March 11, both the leading political parties are keeping their fingers crossed. While most exit polls on Thursday gave the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a clean sweep, leaders in the outgoing Congress government are confident of a win.

On Saturday, votes will be counted on 864 tables, at 15 counting centres, which will be manned by over 11,000 personnel. Heavy security arrangements have been made to ensure that after the tally is announced, there is no untoward incident between rival political parties and their supporters, an official said.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat, who faced an all-round attack from the BJP and his old associates, who switched to BJP ahead of the polls in February, was confident of winning the Uttarakhand assembly elections again. ""Based on the work done by the Congress government, we are going to form the government again,"" Mr Rawat said.

Mr Rawat predicted a ""minimum of 45 seats"" for the Congress in the 70-member house. He also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ""degrading the office of the PM"" by his language during his poll campaigns. 

""We have the blessings of the people and we are going to romp home to power again,"" he said confidently. The opposition BJP, which got 31 seats against 32 for Congress in the 2012 elections, is enthusiastic about its performance. We will get more than 50 seats and the Congress will be routed as people are not only angry at the present Rawat government but are also looking with great hope towards the BJP for development of the state,"" said BJP's Ajay Bhatt.

By-polls for 69 seats was held in Uttarakhand on February 15. Voting in the state's Udham Singhnagar constituency was held on March 9, after the death of a candidate.

Over 65 per cent of the 75.92 lakh voted in the assembly elections. The ballot took place in 10,854 polling stations. Both the Congress and the BJP contested for all the 70 assembly seats, while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) fielded 69 candidates, Samajwadi Party 25 candidates and regional outfit Uttarakhand Kranti Dal fielded candidates for 55 seats. For a simple majority in the house, 36 seats are needed. 

During the campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the hill state to punish the Congress, which he said, had brought disrepute to the 'devbhoomi'. The Congress, on the other hand, targeted the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a host of other issues, including demonetisation. At stake is the fate of 637 candidates, of whom 62 are women and two from the third gender.

"Uttar Pradesh: A State With History Of Hung Verdicts And Unstable Governments","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-a-state-with-history-of-hung-verdicts-and-unstable-governments-1668424","Lucknow:                             Will Uttar Pradesh, which has witnessed long stretches of political instability and fractured verdicts, pick a clear winner like the last two assembly elections? Votes will be counted from 8 am on Saturday in India's most politically crucial state, where the results will be seen as an indicator for the 2019 national election.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati and other leaders campaigned exhaustively here, addressing multiple rallies.

Uttar Pradesh, the country's biggest state with over 22 crore people, has been through long spells of President's rule, hung verdicts, mass defections and mid-term polls.

Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati ended a spell of instability when in 2007, she won a spectacular victory based on her social engineering formula that went beyond her traditional Dalit vote bank to reach out to the upper castes. In the next election in 2012, it was Akhilesh Yadav's turn to celebrate after winning comfortably.

Uttar Pradesh has been placed under President's rule 10 times, the last time in 2002.

There is hardly any combination that has not been tried in the state.

In the late 1990s, the BJP and Mayawati came together with a plan to rotate the chief minister's post between the parties for a six-month period - an experiment that didn't work.

Of the 16 state assemblies elected since 1952, a single party won a majority and completed a full five-year term only seven times. Nine times, governments were short-lived - one lasted four months.

Mid-term elections have been called as many as seven times; the last time was in 1998.

Uttar Pradesh was the base and the favourite hunting ground for the Congress in the initial years after Independence, when many top leaders leading state and national politics. But it was this state that became the first to get a non-Congress government.  

In 1967, Charan Singh and his socialist colleagues left the Congress to form the Bharatiya Kranti Dal and formed the government.

Senior Samajwadi leader and a minister in the Akhilesh Yadav cabinet, Ravidas Mehrotra, while questioning the SP-Congress alliance, said the SP would have won on its own and there was no need for this tie-up with the Congress. He also said that in the final outcome the Congress would have gained from the alliance and not the Samajwadi Party.

While senior party leaders and workers have been questioning the tie-up right since beginning, it had so far been in private. Mehrotra is the first to have expressed his feelings openly in public.

In a related development, Urban Development Minister Mohd Adam Khan, said in case the SP lost at the hustings, the blame would not be of Akhilesh Yadav alone.

""Khuda na kare aisi naubat aaye, gar aisa hua to iski zimmedari sabki hoga aur ye nuksaan poore pradesh ka hoga (God forbid that such a result happens then the responsibility should be shared by all),"" he said.

He also said that Mulayam Singh Yadav's wife Sadhna Gupta's statement that ""Akhilesh should not have humiliated his father"" in a recent interview ""could have been avoided"".

SP contested the assembly elections in alliance with the Congress which was given 105 seats and the remaining 298 were contested by it. Voting for the 403 seats of the UP assembly will be counted at 75 counting centres in the state from 8am on Saturday."

Not ruling out post poll alliance with BSP, says Akhilesh Yadav
Elections in the state were held in seven phases
                                The much-anticipated climax of the high decibel assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is just a few hours away. The seven-phased polls spread over a month of voting had its share of firsts, avoidable gaffes and embarrassing statements.

It was for the first time since 1999 that Congress President Sonia Gandhi didn't campaign in Uttar Pradesh, from where she and son Rahul Gandhi are members of the Lok Sabha. She is currently undergoing medical treatment abroad.

It was also unusual that BJP veterans LK Advani and Kanpur MP Murli Manohar Joshi didn't hit the campaign trail. Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and the presumptive Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, before the Congress struck an alliance with the SP, also remained absent.

Another bigwig Samajwadi Party patriarch and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was also missing in action, well mostly, and campaigned only for daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, who contested from Lucknow Cantt and brother Shivpal Singh Yadav in Jaswantnagar. In contrast, he had addressed at least 300 rallies during the 2012 elections.

After a poll of exit polls last evening showed the BJP getting 211 of the state's 403 assembly seats, Mr Akhilesh, who had earlier ruled out a post-poll alliance with the BSP, said that if there is a hung assembly, he will prefer a partnership with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party over President's Rule in the state. Who would have imagined that?

Mulayam Singh's second wife Sadhna Gupta, just hours before the last round of polling in Poorvanchal, alleged in an hour-long interview that ""no matter what, nobody should have disrespected Netaji, it is he who founded and nurtured the party"". After staying quiet for the past two decades, this was Ms Sadhna's first public outing.

The UP elections were held in seven phases. Counting of votes will begin at 8am on March 11.

Counting of votes will begin at 8 am today and trends are expected to start coming in at 11 am.

In the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh - India's largest and the most crucial to its politics - the BJP ran a hard-fought campaign to wrest power from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (which contested this time in alliance with Rahul Gandhi's Congress). An aggregate of Exit Polls have predicted a win for the BJP.

In Punjab however, all exit polls have predicted a wipeout for the ruling Akali Dal-BJP alliance and contest is seen between the Congress and the Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur election results will also throw up interesting political insights - critical for a read of the way things are shaping for the 2019 General Elections.

Counting will take place at 157 centres -- Punjab (53), Goa (2), UP (75), Uttarakhand (15) and Manipur (12). By 12 noon, a final picture could emerge on who would be the major players in the five states.

According to Election Commission guidelines, half-an-hour after the postal ballots are counted, the process of counting of EVM votes begins.

The 'ballot unit' is switched on in the presence of senior poll officials and counting agents of candidates and the result command keyed in to get the results per machine.

Where a paper trail audit or 'voter-verified paper audit trail' (VVPAT) has been used, the counting agent can call for a count of the paper slips in the drop box attached to the voting machine, but a final count is taken by the returning officer.

Once the results are declared, the names of the winning candidates will find mention in the gazette. The gazette notification will initiate the process to form the next legislative assemblies in the states.

Among many interesting events in the state, one polling station in the remote Saikul constituency in the newly created Kangpokpi district saw voting thrice this season.

Saikul, 60km away from Imphal, has 11 candidates in the fray - highest for any constituency in this poll. This tribal-reserved seat is dominated by the Kuki tribe, and went to polls on March 4 in the first phase.

""It is a crucial seat and we had ensured a tight security cover yet we found some malpractices and ordered a repoll,"" Manipur's Chief Electoral officer VK Dewangan told NDTV.

The repolling took place yesterday, but the BJP again filed a complaint against the Congress candidate for booth capturing and the EC after scrutiny ordered another repoll.

About 1,000 voters are voting for the third time today.

""People from remote areas have actively participated in the polls. The political parties are locked in a fierce battle in Saikul which has many heavyweight candidates this time,"" said local journalist Kaybie Chongloi from Kangpokpi.

The EC had directed that the polling was to be held in the Saikul police station and not in the polling booth that was allegedly 'rigged' twice.

The Manipur assembly election 2017 has been unique in many ways. From peaceful polling amid a four-month long economic blockade, the BJP's surge as a formidable opponent in this Congress stronghold to activist Irom Sharmila's foray into politics and a high voter turnout in the two-phased polls for the 60-member assembly, Manipur is experiencing an exciting moment.

The first phase recorded 86.5 per cent polling, followed by 88 per cent in the second phase. Repolling at 34 booths in eight constituencies of the first phase yesterday stood at 89 per cent."

""The ground reality is very different, for voters per seat above 1.5 lakh you can't decide on the basis of exit polls that have a 20,000 sample size,"" the cricketer turned politician said. He has predicted that Arvind Kejriwal's ""AAP will get around 40 seats and the Akali-BJP won't get more than 10."" The Congress he reckons will win the rest.

Punjab has 117 assembly seats. To form government a party needs to win 59 seats. Exit polls on Thursday predicted a big rout for the incumbent Akali Dal- BJP government and a close finish between the Congress and AAP, which makes its debut in assembly elections in the state.

Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal of the Akali Dal, which has along with ally BJP, ruled Punjab for the last 10 years, too said the exit polls have got it wrong. He said his alliance would win 72 seats in the state to be re-elected for a third straight term.

Mr Sidhu, who quit the BJP after a decade in the party last year, was in talks for weeks with Mr Kejriwal, who is also Delhi Chief Minister, to join AAP. Those negotiations failed reportedly over Mr Sidhu's demand that he be projected as the party's presumptive Chief Minister.

He then held prolonged talks with the Congress before joining the party in a deal said to have been clinched by the Congress' Priyanka Gandhi, credited by her party with playing a bigger strategic role than before in these assembly elections. The Congress has also said that Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, ensured the alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh.

Poll of exit polls showed BJP getting 211 of UP's 403 assembly seats
Counting of votes will take place on March 11
                                Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has done a neat u-turn today saying his Samajwadi Party is open to a partnership with arch-rival Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh if needed, even as a poll of exit polls this evening showed the BJP getting 211 of the state's 403 assembly seats, which would put it safely past the 202 needed to form government.

At 8.30 pm on Thursday, an aggregate of six exit polls showed the BJP getting 211, the Samajwadi Party-Congress 122 and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 61 seats.

Two surveys helped the BJP past the halfway mark in the poll of exit polls by predicting a huge win for the party - India Today-Axis has predicted that the BJP will get between 251 and 285 seats, while News 24 - Today's Chanakya gives the party 285 seats.

Three other exit polls show the BJP well ahead of the other parties but falling short of 202, while one, by Times Now - VMR predicts the party will get between 190 to 210 seats, the upper end of which will give it a majority.
 
Akhilesh Yadav, who had only days ago emphatically ruled out a post-poll alliance with the BSP, has been quoted by BBC Hindi today as saying that if there is a hung assembly in the state on Saturday, when results will be announced, he will prefer a partnership with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party over President's Rule in the state.

""I have always treated the BSP (Mayawati's party) with respect, so it's natural for people to assume we may seek her help. It's difficult to say at this point. I am confident the Congress-SP alliance will win...but look, nobody wants President's Rule, the BJP to run Uttar Pradesh by remote control,"" Mr Yadav said. In election speeches this year Ms Mayawati has attacked Akhilesh's father Mulayam Singh Yadav, but rarely the young Chief Minister. 


Mr Yadav has been ""changing his stand for the past six months,"" alleged senior BJP leader Om Mathur dismissing the possibility of a close contest. ""The BJP will form government in UP with two-thirds majority. All polls indicate a change in UP,"" he said.

Rita Bahuguna, imported by the BJP from the Congress just before the elections, said her party will get ""at least 240 seats in UP""

""Not fair to be so confident of a win even before the votes have been counted,"" said the Congress' Sachin Pilot, whose party has partnered with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party for the UP elections.

The marathon UP election, held over seven rounds of voting, is seen as a bellwether for the 2019 national election. The BJP is seeking to form government after 15 years in the country's most populous state and did not project a presumptive Chief Minister, asking for votes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development agenda.

The result will also be seen as a referendum on PM Modi's notes ban in November last year, aimed at eliminating corruption and black money. It resulted in a cash crunch that rival parties made a core issue to attack the BJP with.

Akhilesh Yadav came out of a family feud that saw him dethrone his father Mulayam Singh Yadav as Samajwadi Party chief, to seek re-election in partnership with the Congress.  

Results will be declared for UP and four other states on Saturday, March 11.

"How To Check The Results Of Uttarakhand Assembly Elections 2017","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/how-to-check-the-results-of-uttarakhand-assembly-elections-2017-1668110","The assembly elections in Uttarakhand was seen as a direct contest between the ruling Congress and the BJP. Three exit polls have predicted that the BJP will get a landslide victory in the 70-member assembly, while a fourth poll shows the BJP and the Congress tied. The aggregate -- the poll of exit polls -- shows the BJP decisively winning the hill state. A party needs to get 36 seats to form government in the 70-member hill state.

The 2012 elections had thrown up a hung assembly, with the Congress winning 32 seats and the BJP 31. The Congress got help from Mayawati's BSP, Independents and others to cross the majority mark.  The BSP legislators also played a crucial role last year, helping the Harish Rawat government survive a trust vote after a number of Congress legislators rebelled against him.

None of the exit polls today show the BSP winning a seat this year. The party had won 3 seats in 2012.

Ahead of the elections, several Congress leaders joined the BJP, which fielded them despite challenge from local leaders. The strategy seem to have paid off if the exit polls are to be believed. Two out of four exit polls showed the BJP scoring a big win in the state, one shows the party ahead while one shows a repeat of 2012, when the party was neck and neck with the Congress.

Exit polls, of course, often get it wrong and the actual results will only be known on Saturday, March 11, when votes are counted in Uttarakhand and four other states, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa and Manipur are known.

By and large, an aggregate of the poll of exit polls suggests the BJP - that hopes to ride to power on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and contested the election without a chief ministerial face - has a clear advantage in Uttar Pradesh but the numbers fluctuated widely, ranging from a low of 155 to (India TV - C Voter) to a high of 279 (India Today - Axis). If the election results are along these lines, it would indicate that the Samajwadi Party-Congress tie-up that Akhilesh Yadav hoped would help him retain the chief minister's chair, did not work.

But did they get it right?

Exit polls, of course, often get it wrong and the actual results will only be known on Saturday, March 11, when votes are counted in Uttarakhand and four other states, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa and Manipur are known.

"Assembly Elections 2017: PM Narendra Modi Leads Party To Big Wins, Including In UP, Show Exit Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/whos-winning-up-punjab-heres-what-early-exit-polls-show-1667971","New Delhi: HighlightsBJP is single-largest party in Uttar Pradesh, exit polls show
Very close call in Punjab, one poll forecasts AAP-Congress tie
BJP seen winning Uttarakhand, Goa and in Manipur 2 polls present conflict
                                At 5.30 pm, television channels began broadcasting exit polls for the five states that have voted. The picture for Uttar Pradesh is clear - the BJP is ahead, based on an aggregate of the polls - whereas in Punjab, it's a very close call with one poll forecasting a perfect tie for the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party. Uttarakhand has definitively picked the BJP, according to most polls; the party appears to have retained Goa; Manipur's decision is no clearer with exit polls - one shows the Congress holding the state, another shows it switching to the BJP.

Remember the usual health warning: exit polls often get it wrong. Results will be declared on Saturday, when you can watch election guru Prannoy Roy on NDTV, starting at 7 am on air and on our site and apps. For now, we're looking at the poll of exit polls for each state - the aggregate of different polls.

Who will win Uttar Pradesh which has 403 seats? The majority mark is 202. The BJP gets 211 according to the poll of polls - that means it will form the government. Mayawati places third in all options.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav told BBC Hindi that he cannot rule out seeking a partnership with Mayawati, if his alliance with the Congress falls short. ""I have always treated the BSP (Mayawati's party) with respect, so it's natural for people to assume we may seek her help. It's difficult to say at this point. I am confident the Congress-SP alliance will win...but look, nobody wants President's Rule, the BJP to run Uttar Pradesh by remote control.""
 
For Punjab, based on five exit polls, it's nearly too-close-to-call. Two polls show the Congress winning, the other shows AAP ahead; two place the parties neck-and-neck. The aggregate shows the same with the Congress ahead by just two seats. The Akali-BJP incumbent alliance is demolished.
 
Uttarakhand, which has 70 seats, is a landslide win for the BJP according to three exit polls, but a fourth poll shows the BJP and the Congress tied. The aggregate shows BJP decisively winning the hill state.
 
Three exit polls for Goa, which has 40 seats show the BJP retaining the state.
 
Manipur which has 60 seats is forecast to pick the BJP in one poll, and the Congress in another.
  The election results will be used to measure Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and his chances of returning for a second term in 2019. The BJP's performance will also be seen as a referendum on the PM's abrupt decision in November to ban high-denomination notes to crackdown on corruption and tax evasion."

The seven-phase elections will end on March 8 while the campaign for the final phase has already entered its last lap.

According to an analysis of self-sworn affidavits of total 4,823 candidates in this election (out of 4853 overall in the fray) by the Uttar Pradesh Election Watch and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), 859 have disclosed criminal cases against them (18 per cent) and further 704 have serious criminal cases (15 per cent).

ADR said 31 candidates were not analysed due to unclear affidavit available on the ECI website.

It found as many as 1,457 crorepati candidates across the seven phases (30 per cent), while the overall average asset of those in the fray stood at Rs 1.91 crore.

The share of those with criminal cases stood at 19 per cent in the UP assembly polls in 2012, while the number of candidates with serious criminal cases, including cases related to rape, murder, kidnapping, communal disharmony and crime against women, has gone up from 8 per cent in the last elections.

ADR said 62 candidates have declared cases related to murder, while 148 candidates have declared cases of attempt to murder in the ongoing elections.

A total of 38 candidates have declared cases related to crimes against women, including ten related to rape.

 The number of candidates with cases related to kidnapping is 34, while 22 have declared cases related to communal disharmony and 63 about electoral violations.

 On party-wise analysis, ADR said 150 out of 400 candidates from the BSP (40 per cent)) have declared criminal cases, while the same for the BJP is 36 per cent and for the SP it is 37 per cent and 32 per cent in case for the Congress.

In terms of serious criminal cases, the BSP has 31 per cent such candidates, followed by 29 per cent for the SP, 26 per cent for the BJP and 22 per cent for the Congress.

As many as 152 constituencies (38 per cent) in the UP assembly polls have three or more candidates with declared criminal cases.

The events would follow massive back to back road shows held by PM Modi and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi through the holy city today.

The BJP leaders said Mr Modi's road show today will cover a different and much wider area during which the party candidates would accompany him.

Yesterday, Mr Modi paid obeisance at the historic Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples as part of his mega road show.

The campaign led by Mr Modi in the city underlines the stake the BJP has in the Prime Minister's Lok Sabha constituency where it had won three of the five assembly seats in 2012. The Samajwadi Party had won the remaining two.

However, what is significant is that the SP and the Congress, both allies now but rivals five years back, had together polled more votes than the BJP in two of the three seats it had won.

With Mr Modi now representing Varanasi in the Lok Sabha, his party is doing all it can to put up a commanding performance.

A host of Union ministers and top BJP leaders led by Amit Shah have been camping here to lead the party's campaign for the last phase of polls.

The Prime Minister will stay in Varanasi overnight and hold more public events tomorrow.

As many as 40 seats will go to the polls in the last phase of the UP elections on March 8. The results will be out on March 11."

In 2014 general elections, BJP won equivalent of 337 of 403 seats
SP-Congress must retain core vote share of 36% to stand a chance in 2017
                                As chief minister Akhilesh Yadav seeks to be re-elected in Uttar Pradesh, will his Samajwadi Party's strategic alliance with the Congress help him in his bid? Yes, if the state votes like it did five years ago in the assembly elections of 2012. No, if it votes the way it did in the 2014 general elections.

In 2012, Akhilesh Yadav led his party to victory in UP, winning 226 of the state's 403 assembly seats. The Samajwadi Party got 29 per cent of the votes. The Congress, with 14 per cent vote share, had won 38 seats. In quite a few seats the Congress was second.

If the two parties had fought that election together as they are now, they would've won 43 per cent of the vote share, with the Samajwadi Party winning 270 seats and the Congress 82. It would have meant 88 more seats with a combined total of 352 - a landslide win.

The additional seats would have come mostly at the cost of Mayawati's BSP. Her party, which had won 80 seats in 2012, would've won only 20 seats if the SP and Congress had been partners then.
The 2014 general election, however, was a complete contrast. The BJP, which had won only 47 seats with its 15 per cent vote share in 2012, rode a Modi wave to win 71 of UP's 80 parliamentary seats along with ally Apna Dal, equal to 337 assembly seats.
If the Samajwadi Party, which got 20 per cent votes for five Lok Sabha seats or 42 assembly seats, and the Congress - eight per cent votes for two Lok Sabha seats (15 assembly seats) - had been partners in 2014, they would've together won the equivalent of 85 assembly seats, denting the BJP's number by about only 27 seats only.
 
On numbers, the UP alliance is not quite as ""grand"" as the one that the Congress had built for the 2015 Bihar assembly elections with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United and Lalu Prasad's RJD. The coming together of the three parties had meant that a consolidation of their core votes added up to 47 per cent of the vote share.

The core votes of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress add up to 36 per cent in UP. The two parties are fighting hard to hold on to the their core support bases in the face of a tough challenge from both the BJP and the BSP. 
The UP elections are being held in seven phases. Votes will be counted on March 11."

"Andhra Pradesh Backs Idea To Hold Simultaneous Lok Sabha, Assembly Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/andhra-pradesh-news/andhra-pradesh-backs-idea-to-hold-simultaneous-lok-sabha-assembly-polls-1666610","Amaravati:                             The Andhra Pradesh government today backed the idea to hold simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state Assemblies and even suggested that polls to urban and rural local bodies too be held within one year thereon. Governor E S L Narasimhan articulated the state's stand while addressing the joint session of the Addhra Pradesh legislative Council and the Assembly on the opening day of the Budget session in the new Legislature building in Amaravati.

""My government is in full agreement with the view that elections to both state assemblies and Lok Sabha be held simultaneously so that Centre and state governments could pay their undivided attention to issues of policy and governance.

We will go a step further and suggest that elections to urban and rural local bodies too should be held within one year of the elections to the State and Central legislative Houses,"" the Governor said.

""Historically, elections to state assemblies and Lok Sabha began together but over the years, for varied reasons, they were de-coupled. Now the situation has come to a stage that we conduct elections in significantly large parts of the country almost every year, if not throughout the year. Political parties, and therefore governments, have to continually keep an eye on electoral calculations,"" Mr Narasimhan pointed out.

Simultaneous polls would give governments a ""full four years of undistracted"" time to address issues of governance, the Governor said, adding ""it is desirable"" to have a national debate involving all sections of people."

PM Modi, who arrived in the city yesterday morning, held a roadshow followed by a public meeting late in the evening. This is the second roadshow that he is holding in two days in his Lok Sabha constituency with less than three days left for the final phase of polls in the state. The opposition criticised his yesterday's roadshow and the Congress even lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging that the show of strength was made without the requisite permission.

Here are the live updates of PM Modi's speech:I do not know how to thank people of Kashi. They have broken yesterday's records. This love and affection inspires me to serve people moreI had started a rally from Kashmir to Kanyakumari under Murali Manohar JoshiVaranasi has a special place in the heart of every Indian.It is not only a city but a city of traditions and culture.I have big dreams for Varanasi.Our aim is of a Banaras that is modern yet retains its heritage.Our motto is sabka saath sabka vikas, but Congress, SP and BSP have different culture of politics that says kuch ka saath kuch ka vikasThe eastern part of India has to scale new heights of development.UP government is not letting my work show.Notes ban united other parties against me.This land of Uttar Pradesh, this part of the state is blessed with very talented people. The potential for development is immense.Had there been good and proper government, then the states could have flourished even further.Shouldn't corruption come to an end? Its been so many years since we attained freedom but a small section misused their power and position.UP government hasn't been able to utilise the funds given by centre.I want to tell all honest citizens- no one will ever trouble you. Immandar Ka Samman HogaEarlier the question being asked would be- what money was lost (in the scams), now the question is- Modi Ji what has come backIt is sad that driven by politics, some people wanted proof of surgical strikes and were asking did any Indian soldier dieI have inherited nothing. Whatever I have got is from the people of KashiWe wanted to build a ring road but the state government did not cooperate and kept obstructing that.

"UP Elections 2017: Curtains Down On Hectic Campaigning In State, Politicians Take Chota Sa Break","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-curtains-down-on-hectic-campaigning-in-state-politicians-take-a-break-1667192","Chandel, Manipur:                             Activist Irom Sharmila's challenge to Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh of the Congress in his Thoubal constituency, is the most watched contest in tomorrow's second and last round of assembly elections in Manipur. But it is the BJP that has the man who has ruled the state for the last 15 years worried.

In the crucial second phase, 22 constituencies will vote. Ten of these are in Thoubal district in the valley and considered Chief Minister Ibobi Singh's stronghold. The rest are in the tribal-dominated hills. Of these 22 seats, the Congress had won 14 and two other MLAs later joined it. Effectively, the ruling party is fighting to retain 16 seats tomorrow.

The BJP, which hopes to win its third state in the northeast after Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, did not win a single seat five years ago in the 60-member Manipur assembly. But most of the Congress' top leaders from the hill areas have switched to the BJP in the last six months. Most of them are from the Kuki tribe, traditionally a Congress support base.  

Ibobi Singh has attempted damage control in the last few months by carving out seven new districts for ""administrative convenience,"" a decision that has made the Kukis happy. But the Nagas are upset. The issue has polarised voters like never before, setting plains against hills and tribe against tribe.

While it is not clear whether the Congress has salvaged support among the Kukis, the BJP may be unable to tap into the Naga anger. Since the district split in December last year, the BJP has made inroads in the hills, but the Naga People's Front or NPF, a BJP ally at the centre and in Nagaland, is contesting separately in Manipur.

The NPF, which has opposed the creation of the seven districts, debuted in the last assembly elections winning four seats out of the 12 it contested - all in the hills. It is contesting 15 seats this time.

A straight BJP versus NPF contest is expected in four Naga-majority districts -- Tamenlong, Chandel, Ukhrul and Senapati, which could benefit the Congress. The other seats have a large population of Kukis, and these are being watched closely for how they vote.

Two Congress legislators moved to the BJP after they were ""banned"" from their constituencies in the Kuki belt in 2015 following violence over three bills passed by Ibobi Singh's government that were seen as ""anti-tribal"". Nine people had died in violent protests, six of them in police firing.

The BJP is also eyeing the 10 seats in Thoubal district, reaching out to the minority voters, the Manipuri Muslims or Meitei Pangals. They are about 10 per cent of the state's 19 lakh voters and could influence at least six Thoubal constituencies.

Activist Irom Sharmila, who broke a 16-year hunger strike against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act last year, has since launched the 'Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance' and is contesting three seats in Manipur.

The first round of voting in Manipur last Saturday for 38 seats saw a record 86.5 per cent turnout. The BJP says the high turnout is a vote for change. The Congress claims it has swept Manipur every time there has been record voting.

Votes will be counted on Saturday, March 11."
"UP Elections 2017: Amid Rose Petal Shower, Slogans, PM Modi Holds Varanasi Roadshow","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modi-begins-roadshow-in-varanasi-1666378","Varanasi: HighlightsPM Modi is campaigning in Varanasi ahead of phase 7 polls in UP
This is his second roadshow in the city in 2 days
Uttar Pradesh will vote in final phase on March 8; counting on March 11
                                The narrow streets of temple town Varanasi turned into a sea of saffron flags as Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his second roadshow in as many days in his parliamentary constituency. With just three days to go for the last and final phase of the crucial assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has pulled all stops - with the Prime Minister planning to campaign in Varanasi for three consecutive days.  Today, PM Modi rode an open-top vehicle, waving to flag and balloon-waving supporters who all but choked the road. Chants of ""Modi, Modi"" and ""Vandemataram"" could be heard throughout the 5-km stretch from Police Lines to Kashi Vidyapeeth.

Later this evening, he is expected to address an election rally. He is expected to stay in the city overnight and tomorrow, before campaigning ends, will lead another rally and address a meeting.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister had hit the campaign trail in the temple town with an impromptu roadshow while he was on his way to two of the city's most revered shrines -- Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples -- in the morning. In the evening, he had held a public meeting.

Critics have questioned the appropriateness of the Prime Minister holding a roadshow. Even BJP's Union minister Upendra Kushwaha had said he didn't feel ""it was right"".

The SP, BSP and the Congress have alleged that the BJP's continued focus on Varanasi only betrays its nervousness about the contests in the high-profile constituency. In 2012, the party had won only three of the five assembly constituencies that comprise PM Modi's parliamentary seat. The Samajwadi Party had won the other two.

Hitting out at the Prime Minister, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who was speaking at a rally in Sonbhadra, said, ""One roadshow was done. It failed. He is doing one more. It will also fail and
then again a roadshow will be held...Now he will go somewhere else"".

The opposition criticised yesterday's roadshow and the Congress had even lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging that the show of strength was made without the necessary permissions. The BJP said the show was entirely impromptu."
"On Election Commission Wishlist: Barring Candidates Who Default On Power, Water Bills","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/on-election-commission-wishlist-barring-candidates-who-default-on-power-water-bills-1666425","New Delhi:                             The Election Commission wants laws to be changed so that it can disqualify from contesting polls the candidates who do not clear their water and power bills.

It has asked the Law Ministry to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1951, so that such defaulters can be barred from contesting Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.

According to the poll panel, it will require amendment to the chapter-III of the RP Act which deals with electoral offences.

A new clause will have to be inserted therein for disqualification ""on the ground of being a defaulter of public dues"".

The issue is pending with the government. In an August, 2015 order, the Delhi High Court had asked the Commission to ensure that candidates contesting Lok Sabha and Assembly elections furnish a 'no dues certificate' from the agency providing electricity, water and telephone connections to their accommodation.

Since February, 2016, the Commission had been insisting on an additional affidavit in the prescribed format along with the 'No Demand Certificate' from the agencies providing these services.

A 'no rent due' certificate is also required in case the candidate had been occupying government accommodation during the 10 years leading to the polls.

The Delhi High Court, while delivering the verdict, had said that those wanting to contest elections will clear their dues after the order.

In March 2016, when the EC had met political parties here to discuss electoral reforms, it was told that the 'no dues certificate' for candidates was leading to corruption as bribes were being allegedly paid to obtain it.

Recently, the Commission had proposed that political parties, as a pre-condition for fielding candidates, furnish affidavit stating that they have not defaulted on dues on account of usages of public utilities."
"Manipur Elections 2017: It's BJP Versus Ibobi Singh In Thoubal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-its-bjp-versus-ibobi-singh-in-thoubal-1666741","Thoubal, Manipur:                             After an encouraging voter turnout of 87 per cent in the first phase of Manipur assembly election, the BJP went full throttle with campaigning for the second phase where voting for the remaining 22 seats will take place on March 8.

The BJP is eyeing the 10 seats in the Thoubal district that has been three-time Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh's bastion for the last 15 years. Thoubal is also the most keenly watched seat in the assembly election where activist-turned-politician Irom Sharmila is taking on Mr Ibobi Singh.

The BJP is doing every bit to reach out to the minority voters, the Manipuri Muslims or Meitei Pangals. They constitute about 10 per cent of the state's 19 lakh voters. Of the 22 seats that go to polls in the second phase, Muslim votes are going to influence at least six constituencies in the Thoubal district.

""The Congress calls us communal, but we have an alliance with People's Democratic Party in Jammu and Kashmir. In the Christian-dominated Nagaland, we have an alliance with the ruling party. We never do politics of communities,"" BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav said while addressing a gathering in Lilong in Thoubal yesterday.

The BJP's sole Muslim candidate in Manipur is from Lilong. Nobody would have envisaged a BJP rally in Thoubal especially in the minority belt of Lilong in the early days. Clearly times have changed.

Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, on the other hand, asserts that the Congress has always promoted communal harmony in the northeastern state.

""We have ensured sharing of power with the minorities at the grass-root level,"" Ibobi Singh had told Muslim voters during several rallies.  

Congress had won nine of the 10 seats in Thoubal in the last election. Manipur's biggest political survivor, Mr Ibobi Singh, has lost only once in Thoubal. His supporters claim that Thoubal is as developed as Imphal, Manipur's capital.

""In his three terms, Mr Ibobi Singh has done a lot of development work for Thoubal and Manipur. We are happy with his efforts,"" said Binoba Devi, Thoubal resident."
"As Varanasi Votes, PM Narendra Modi Is Back Home In Gujarat After Hectic UP Campaign","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-varanasi-votes-pm-narendra-modi-is-back-home-in-gujarat-after-hectic-up-campaign-1667368","Ahmedabad:                             As Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh reported brisk voting on Wednesday morning, PM Modi was in his home state Gujarat, deep in prayer at the famous Somnath temple. With him was BJP chief Amit Shah. Both leaders are in Gujarat after a hectic campaign that saw them camped in Varanasi in a bid to secure the crucial eastern UP region for the BJP in assembly elections in the country's most populous state.   

In Somnath, PM Modi and Mr Shah will attend a meeting of the temple trust of which both are members, before PM Modi returns to capital Gandhinagar to address 6,000 women sarpanch or village heads on Women's Day. Last night he was hosted for dinner by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani attended by BJP members of parliament and party legislators in Gujarat.

Just out of an intense campaign in the marathon seven-phase Uttar Pradesh election, PM Modi's visit to Gujarat is being linked to assembly elections in his home state due later this year. A massive revolt by the Patels or Patidaars in Gujarat, once a staunch support base of the BJP, has put the party on the backfoot after over two decades of ruling the state.

As Amit Shah drove up to Somnath on Monday night, Patel protesters threw eggs at his cavalcade and raised slogans against him. The Patels are angry that the BJP government has not accepted its demand for reservation in government jobs and colleges.

On Tuesday, PM Modi also announced that eight state highways will converted into national highways, inaugurated a petrochemical investors region and also the country's biggest cable bridge in Bharuch, south Gujarat.  Most of the highways are in Saurashtra, dominated by Patels.

The assembly elections in Gujarat - where PM Modi was chief minister for 13 years before he moved to Delhi after the BJP's big win in the 2014 national election - will be the next big test for the BJP after the UP elections.   

The party has gone flat out to try and replicate its success in the 2014 national election when it had won 71 - 73 along with partner Apna Dal - of UP's 80 seats. Worries for it have come from western UP, where the Jats, who voted en masse for the BJP in the national election, are upset over PM Modi's notes ban and over their demand for reservation not being met.

The party has attempted to make up in eastern UP, where 40 constituencies are voting today in the seventh and last round of voting in the state, which has 403 seats in its legislature.

PM Modi's Varanasi has eight assembly seats - the BJP currently holds three of those, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party have two each and the Congress has one.

Votes will be counted on Saturday, March 11."
"UP Elections 2017: BJP's Varun Gandhi Was 'Too Busy' To Campaign In UP, Says Mother Maneka","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjps-varun-gandhi-was-too-busy-to-campaign-in-up-explains-mother-maneka-1666750","New Delhi: HighlightsVarun Gandhi is a member of Parliament from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh
Mr Gandhi reportedly upset BJP didn't back him over 'honey-trap' scandal
Mr Gandhi's supporters say he should have been BJP's face in UP
                                BJP leader Varun Gandhi was ""too busy"" to campaign for his party in the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, his mother and union minister Maneka Gandhi said today. Campaigning ended in the state on Monday in a marathon election spread over seven rounds and 30 days (February 11-March 11), that saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi address 23 public rallies and BJP chief Amit Shah and top union ministers campaign extensively as the BJP attempts to come back to power in UP after 15 years.

 ""Varun (Gandhi) has been very busy. He's been travelling to speak to students across the country at various campuses,"" Mrs Gandhi said, also pointing out that he is 36 years old and so she really can't speak for him.

Mr Gandhi, the BJP member of Parliament from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh, reportedly excused himself from campaigning in the state as he was upset that the party did not back him amid allegations that he was honey-trapped into revealing defence secrets last year. He did not feature in the first lists of star campaigners that the BJP released and when he was included, it was as an after thought, seen as damage control by the party amid threats of rebellion by Varun Gandhi's supporters in UP.

Mr Gandhi's supporters say the party has sidelined a leader who should have been projected as presumptive chief minister in UP. Some of them, denied BJP ticket, have contested as candidates of rival parties like Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal.

Maneka Gandhi would only say, ""we will soon find out,"" when asked whether she thought not projecting a chief ministerial candidate would hurt the party in UP. The women and child development minister, who represents UP's Pilibhit in parliament, has campaigned a little.

She said she was glad PM Modi had undertaken an extensive campaign in Uttar Pradesh. ""I am glad that the Prime Minister is travelling in Uttar Pradesh, he will see the kind of poor conditions in the state,'' Mrs Gandhi said."
"After State Polls, Election Panel To Decide Fate of Arvind Kejriwal's 21 MLAs","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/after-state-polls-election-panel-to-decide-fate-of-arvind-kejriwals-21-mlas-1666189","NEW DELHI:                             The Election Commission's hearing for final arguments to decide the fate of 21 Aam Aadmi Party legislators in Delhi accused of violating the office of profit rule will be held on March 16, days after the commission completes the ongoing election process for five states.

The 21 lawmakers were appointed as parliamentary secretaries to ministers in the Arvind Kejriwal government after AAP swept the 2015 assembly elections in the national capital. Last year, a complaint was filed with the President that the legislators - who cannot hold any public office that entitles them to benefits, financial or otherwise - should be disqualified for taking up the job. The Election Commission, which is mandated to give its recommendations, had started hearings last July.

The Commission has sent notice for the hearing to Prashant Patel who filed the complaint and the 21 lawmakers including Alka Lamba, Jarnail Singh, Adarsh Shastri and Rajesh Gupta, an EC official said.

Kejriwal had defended the appointments saying the legislators were helping the government deliver on the promises made to the people and weren't paid from the exchequer for the extra work that they put in.

The idea behind this provision was to draw a line between the legislature and the executive; so that legislators irrespective of their party affiliation were able to hold the government responsible in the assembly rather than be indebted to it.

As had been done on many occasions in the past by governments, the Kejriwal government tried to circumvent the constitutional bar by getting a bill passed in the assembly to exempt the parliamentary secretary's post from the office of profit. But President Pranab Mukherjee refused to clear the law.

The disqualification proceedings before the EC have also survived last year's high court verdict that scrapped the appointments, ruling that Kejriwal could not have appointed them without concurrence from the Lieutenant Governor."

She is abroad for medical tests and treatment, said sources in her party, without divulging more information.

Mrs Gandhi, 70, left the country on Tuesday and is expected to return on the 22nd, subject to her doctors' advice. In 2011, she was allegedly operated on in the US, but her party refused to provide details of her condition, saying only that she was being treated in America. In August last year, she fell ill during a road show in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency of Varanasi, and was then hospitalized in Delhi, after which her attendance in parliament has been irregular.

Before flying out, she spoke to senior Congress leaders informing them of her plans; she stated that her son Rahul Gandhi, the Congress Vice President, will take decisions on her behalf.

Mr Gandhi, 46, is expected to chair an informal meeting tomorrow with Congress lawmakers tomorrow on their strategy for the parliament session that began today and runs till April 12.

If the Congress fails to check its trend of electoral defeats on Saturday, Mr Gandhi's leadership will be questioned afresh- he led the campaign for his party in Uttar Pradesh, where the Congress signed up as the junior partner of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - and there could be the now periodic calls for his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to take a bigger role in reviving the party which has been vastly attenuated in the last few years."

She, in her speech, hit out at the BJP and Samajwadi Party-Congress on their campaign tactics and said, ""You can get the media limelight for a while with the crowds from outside, but they can't vote for you."" The 61-year-old leader is confident that Uttar Pradesh has decided to give her party majority votes. PM Modi's notes ban, she said, was a move to take people's attention off the key election issues. It created a huge dent and lakhs of people lost their jobs due to the ban of the high-value currency, BSP chief added.

Here are the highlights of Mayawati's speech:

On BJP, SP- Congress campaigns
 BJP and Samajwadi Party-Congress fighting for the second and the third place.In roadshows of both BJP and SP-Congress today in Varanasi, most of the crowd are onlookers.People have been called from neighbouring Bihar and Madhya Pradesh for the roadshows.You can get the media limelight for a while with the crowds, but they can't vote for you. The voters are here in front of me. (Mayawati hits out at BJP).The people of UP have made up their mind to give BSP a majority government.BSP is getting large amounts of votes in sixth phase.The BSP's government will also fulfil the dream of BR Ambedkar.The BJP and SP-Congress are making false claims about support in UP, shows their deceitful side.Don't vote for other parties, especially SP. You know the work that SP has done in UP and (PM) Modi at centre. Their wrong policy decisions has cost the states.The BJP can't muster the courage to name a Chief Minister candidate.SP is known as the government of 'jungle raj'.UP has to decide if it wants to vote for such a government or elect blemish-free face of the BSP.BJP had promised in 2014 to bring back black money and deposit 15 lakh in each person's bank account.
On PM's Constituency Varanasi
 Wherever you go in Varanasi there's dirt and filth. They have not even cleaned their mother Ganga.Whatever promises BJP had made, the PM had made, have not been fulfilled.Varanasi will punish them, the mother Ganga will punish them.Their theatrics of kinds has been exposed.
On Notes Ban
 PM's notes ban has caused a dent and people have not been able to recover from it. Lakhs have lost jobs.BJP, before banning the notes, they converted/managed money in UP for big industrialists. This has not been exposed in the media.This proves that notes ban was not only for their personal gains but also to take people's attention off key election issues.
On Backward Class Reservation
 The Dalit Rohit Vemula controversy is proof that BJP will work against the backward classes.The reservation that backward classes have got in the constitution is not because of the Congress but BR Ambedkar.Dalit and Adhivasis, after they got reservation, were not included in centre's list through false means and stripped off its benefits.The Mandal commission's recommendations on reservation were not applied by Congress government at the centre.In 1989 Lok Sabha elections, when Congress lost power and I was elected to Lok Sabha, BP Singh became the PM. He said BSP should also support us. I told him my two conditions. First, BR Ambedkar be awarded the Bharat Ratan posthumously and second, adopt the Mandal commission report.The BJP then staged mass protests against BR Ambedkar's Bharat Ratna and against reservations for backwards classes. I don't think UP will vote for such a party.BJP just before the elections chose a backward class leader as its state President to get votes.PM Modi is not from a backward class as he claims. He is an upper caste man. He had mischievously made the Mandal Committee include his caste in Other Backward Class category when he was Gujarat Chief Minister."

"UP Elections 2017: Rivals To Get 'Electric Shock' After UP Poll Results: PM Narendra Modi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-rivals-to-get-electric-shock-after-up-poll-results-pm-narendra-modi-1665969","Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said BJP's rivals Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress will get ""electric shocks"" when the results of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are announced.

PM Modi's sharp riposte came in response to a remark by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who had asked him to touch an electric wire to see if current flows through it.

On the campaign trail, PM Modi has been attacking the Samajwadi Party government over ""poor"" power supply in the state and also controversially accused it of discrimination in its distribution along religious lines, a charge rubbished by the Chief Minister.

""On March 11, election results will give electric shock to SP, BSP and Congress,"" he said.

""Akhilesh has dared me to touch an electric wire to find out whether power is really there or not. His new friend Rahul Gandhi, during his 'khaat sabha' at Madihan in Mirzapur, however, had touched the wire and told his party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad that there was nothing to worry as there is no power in the line,"" PM Modi said.

""This is the acceptance of your new friend. Do I need touch the wires anymore? Akhilesh ji, now people have spread such a current that will give shocks to SP, BSP and Congress on March 11,"" he said.

Mr Gandhi had launched a 'khaat sabha' campaign, much before the Samajwadi Party and Congress got into an alliance for the state assembly election, where the Congress vice president would interact with the village folk seated on cots to understand their problems and find solutions. One 'khaat sabha' saw villagers run away with the cots after the meeting had ended.

PM Modi said people had run away with the cots as those belonged to them and they would now ensure the defeat of Congress."
"With PM Narendra Modi As Campaign Face, BJP Eyes Assam Redux In Manipur","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-pm-narendra-modi-as-campaign-face-bjp-eyes-assam-redux-in-manipur-1665047","Imphal, Manipur:                             As the two-phased Manipur assembly elections draw closer, campaigning in the state is at its peak. The BJP, which is hoping to replicate its Assam success in its second northeastern state, has pitched Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its face. BJP president Amit Shah will also try to promote Brand Modi in Manipur. The question is, whether the party can best Congress' master strategist and three-time Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh.

Last week, during PM Modi's rally in Imphal, a group of educated but unemployed Manipuri youth heard promises of jobs on merit. They had come from Thoubal, 30 km from Imphal, the stronghold of the Chief Minister.

""I gave many interviews, but never got a job,"" said 37-year-old Joychandra Singh, who did his Masters in rural development. He voted for Ibobi Singh all his life, but now, he says it's time for 'poriborton' (change) for him.

During his rally last week, PM Modi made a jibe at Ibobi Singh and asked his audience, ""Have you ever heard of a 10 per cent chief minister? Anywhere? Manipur now need zero per cent CM."" The PM had over seven lakh educated yet unemployed youth of Manipur and 55,000 first-time voters on mind.

""We want good roads, better transportation, good hospitals all over Manipur. We want zero corruption and we hope that a change in the form of BJP is going to be good,"" said first-time voter, Neoren Singh.

In the last 15 years of Ibobi Singh's rule, schools in Manipur have always failed to complete their calendar year due to frequent shutdowns and blockades. The last week witnessed protests by youth and students asking PM Modi to make the details of the 2015 Framework Agreement public.

""The centre needs to give details of the framework agreement with Nagas, mere assurances will not do. We don't want to lose our land to the Nagas,"" said M Swamikumar Singh, student from Imphal."

Apart from PM, Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati to address public
Varanasi with 5 assembly seats votes on March 8 in last phase of UP polls
                                If the finishing line makes athletes run faster and feel nervous, politics during elections is no different. With the last phase of polls in Uttar Pradesh just four days away, each political outfit is pulling out all the stops to steal the show in India's most populous state. All of Friday, the entire BJP machinery in Varanasi being led by top ministers displayed a bad case of nerves. A top minister refused attempts by a media crew to get a sound bite by saying, ""Please excuse me. Varanasi may vote on March 8 but our exam is on March 4. PM Modi is coming to Varanasi. He will not just address the rally and visit some temple. He is coming to his constituency and will visit the Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples. It's a visit which will send not a signal but signals.""

Bhupinder Yadav, the BJP general secretary who has been camping here for a week till all the votes come home on March 8, added to the drama with a cryptic comment that barely gave anything away. ""We are not saying that it will be a show of strength tomorrow. We are saying PM is coming for a darshan of voters of Varanasi and a darshan on Baba Vishwanath at Kashi temple,"" he said.

The BJP cadres here are agog - will the PM simply drive down from the landing zone in the Lanka area to Kashi and Bhairon temple and then for the second time for a rally at Town Hall ground? Or will he do something which will send a signal?

""We don't know what the Prime Minister plans. He is expected to travel in a cavalcade to the Kashi temple and then for rally. But will he emerge from the car - or will he turn it into a road show?"" wondered one party worker.

The district administration officials who are preparing for a day-long nightmare with PM's visit during the day say they have no request for a roadshow.

Yogeshwar Mishra, district magistrate of Varanasi, said, ""The programme of the Prime Minister includes a cavalcade drive. There is no information about any kind of roadshow.""

The BJP, which has a lot at stake in the last two phases of polling, had moved its war room to Varanasi several days ago entrusting Union Ministers and senior leaders with the task of strengthening the campaign with the Prime Minister in the front.

Top BJP leaders were deputed to work out and rehearse each element of the Prime Minister's visit. Power Minister Piyush Goyal visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple to check arrangements. The SPG or Special Protection Group and local police carried out a detailed drill. All the vehicles which will be part of the PM's cavalcade went over the route. At the temples, the parking formation as per guidelines was also carried out. Every building along the PM's route will get rooftop security men. And public buildings would be sanitised.
 UP elections 2017: BJP leaders discuss arrangements ahead of PM Modi's rally in Varanasi.At the Town Hall ground, the District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police checked the outer periphery, the barricading the adjoining buildings.

The officials have a tough task ahead. On one hand they have to ensure security for the PM who is coming for election campaigning plus two other political events. The face of the newly-forged Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi, will stage a nearly 10 km-long road show in Varanasi from the Kutchehry area. While Akhilesh Yadav, the Chief Minister, is protected by the National Security Guards, Rahul Gandhi is an SPG-protected leader with a high threat perception.

To match the BJP's effort, the SP-Congress combine has also shifted its focus to Varanasi. Congress campaign strategist Prashant Kishor and his team members are busy crafting Varanasi area-specific strategy. Videos titled 'Dead-e-Banaras' have been posted on the social media sites and Congress leaders say within a few days, the posts have recorded thousands of hits.

Political tension between various outfits is at its peak in the city over these two events as the Akhilesh-Rahul road show is expected to start after the Prime Minister has left Varanasi for a rally in adjoining Janupur and end before the PM returns for a rally in the Town Hall area. The administration has been constantly in touch with the SP-Congress and BJP leaders to ensure that channels created for movement of supporters are strictly adhered to.

The third big event of the day is a public meeting by BSP chief Mayawati in the Rohania area which, to the relief of the local administration, falls outside city limits. But Mayawati's party is known for limited rallies with high turnout. BSP leaders like Nasimuddin Siddiqui have been camping in Varanasi for the last five days to ensure a mega show. The worry for the administration is how to channel the BSP supporters who take trains to reach Varanasi and will be heading from the station to the rally site.

The District Senior Superintendent of Police Nitin Tiwari told NDTV, ""We have to ensure that all events don't overlap or there is no interface between their supporters. We are creating traffic diversions, vehicles for the events are being given specific routes and parking.""
 UP Elections 2017: District officials seen inspecting the venue ahead of PM Modi's rally in Varanasi.Varanasi city has five assembly seats. Last time, the BJP and its current ally Apna Dal had won four while the Samajwadi Party had clinched one. The Saturday push by political parties is aimed at not just the 49 constituencies which will vote on March 8 but from the ancient city set by the Ganges, the parties also plan to send out s signal to voters of Phase 6 who would be reaching polling booths on the same day."

On the basis of a report by poll authorities in Manipur, it also directed the state chief electoral officer get FIRs filed against eight newspapers for publishing the election advertisement.

The Commission identified the papers as Sangai Express -- Manipuri and English editions -- Poknapham, People's Chronicle, Naharolgi, Thoudang, Imphal free press, Echel Express and Huiyen Lanpao.

While there is no bar on the publication of election advertisements 48 hours before the polling, a rule introduced by the Commission during the Bihar assembly polls says that such advertisements should be cleared by a certification committee.

It states that without approval no newspaper will publish such advertisements.

The new rule came after the BJP brought out some controversial advertisements during the Bihar elections."

In the run-up to the elections, all political parties in their campaigns mainly focused on the continuing economic blockade imposed by the United Naga Council and the state government's inability to break it. This invited corruption cases against some leaders in the state too. BJP leaders also levelled corruption charges against the Congress government and its inability to provide basic amenities to the people of the state, particularly the supply of potable water. The Congress countered, saying the government during its 15-year rule implemented several development projects and improved the power supply.

According to data provided by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), national parties Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress have fielded most number of candidates with criminal cases slapped against them. Figures reveal that both parties have 21 candidates with criminal record. The ADR research team analysed 38 independent candidates in Manipur and found that none of the leaders had declared a criminal case against them.

""The BJP has become the Number One party of the baagi and daagi candidates... this time they have not given tickets to people of their own cadre but to those who joined them after leaving other parties... tickets were given to rebels and with those having criminal antecedents,"" she told an election rally in Jaunpur.

""(Because of this) the cadres of the BJP will teach them a lesson in these elections,"" said Mayawati, who also addressed an election meeting in Mirzapur later.

 Claiming that her party will form government with full majority, Mayawati said people of the state will celebrate Holi of communal amity and brotherhood after elections.

Accusing the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of failing to fulfil the poll promises and checking the rising atrocities on dalits and backwards, the BSP chief said the saffron party was out to end reservation or make it ineffective as per the RSS' suggestions.

Making an appeal to the voters, especially Muslim, to vote for the BSP, Mayawati said it would keep the BJP out of power in the state. ""Voting for SP will only benefit the BJP,"" she said and promised that on coming to power she would end corruption, anarchy and the jungle raj of the Samajwadi Party and send criminals behind bars."

""Akhileshji ke pita Mulayam Singh ney purey jivan Congress ka virodh kiya par unhone pita ki kamaiee par paani pher diya (Mulayam opposed Congress all his life but Akhilesh ruined his father's work),"" Mr Singh said at an election meeting in Rasra.

""SP had realised that it is not strong enough to win the polls and so it shook hands with Congress, but Mulayam Singh Yadav has punctured the 'cycle' of SP and feuding uncle Shivpal has broken its chain...how will Akhilesh reach Lucknow on such a cycle with Rahul as the pillion rider?"" the Union Minister asked.

Seeking a response on development works, he claimed all of the Chief Minister's 'kaam' is speaking only in newspapers and TV and none of it is seen on the ground.

On Rahul Gandhi, the Union Minister said four months ago, the Congress leader had held meetings on 'khats' (cots), which are normally used for sleeping and not to hold meetings. Lamenting the political atmosphere in the state, Mr Singh said parties which talked about eradicating poverty and improving the lot of the poor were today honouring money over the hard work of people.

The Union Home Minister also spoke of terrorism and said Pakistan was facing the heat going by developments there in the past 10 days."

Assembly segments of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency of firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, and Mau, where jailed gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari is in fray, also figure in this sixth and penultimate phase of polling.

The campaigning saw BJP state president KP Maurya likening rivals SP, Congress and BSP to different types of venomous ""snakes"" and ""social cancer"" and urging people to eliminate them by voting for the BJP.

 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav countered BJP saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conceded defeat in the polls by talking about a hung house.

While mustering votes for BJP, PM Modi sought to prove wrong the prophets of doom after demonetisation saying the latest GDP data showed note-ban did not affect growth rate but rather improved it.

""Hardwork, in fact, is much more powerful than Harvard,"" he said in an apparent dig at economists.

The prime minister also sounded highly optimistic of the poll outcome for BJP. ""Never have elections gone one way like this... there had been no dearth in enthusiasm of voters in all five phases,"" he said.

The PM also caught UP Chief Minister on the wrong foot and cited government website to nail him. ""Life in Uttar Pradesh is short and uncertain... Uttar Pradesh resembles Saharan Africa,"" PM Modi said quoting a para from the state government's official website up.gov.in.

He also ridiculed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for his latest ""coconut juice"" remark. ""There is a Congress leader, and I want to pray for his long life... he recently went to Manipur to address an
election rally. There he told farmers that he would extract juice from coconuts and send it to London. In fact, a coconut possesses water (and not juice) and it is grown in Kerala,"" he said.

""It is like setting up a potato factory,"" PM Modi said referring to Rahul's earlier remarks that he wants to set up potato factories in Uttar Pradesh.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also hit out at the Prime Minister during his rally today. ""Modiji spoke about our 'karnama' but did not give any account of his work. He is shying away from debate on development. Actually, doing nothing is his biggest karnama,"" he said."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: PM Modi Finds Ammo On UP Government Website To Attack Akhilesh Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-finds-ammo-on-up-government-website-to-attack-akhilesh-yadav-1664983","Lucknow:                             As he attacked Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred twice today to a UP government website that records, ""Life in Uttar Pradesh is short and uncertain."" The Prime Minister was addressing public rallies in eastern UP, where the last two rounds of assembly elections will be held in the next few days.

""Akhilesh Yadav says his work speaks for itself... the UP government website admits life in UP is short and uncertain and that in this respect UP resembles Saharan Africa,"" the Prime Minister said. He wagered that, ""UP officers will face action as soon as I finish my speech.""

PM Modi has dug deep into the official website of the UP government to unearth tragic figures that are perfunctorily featured in a section on the state's economy. The ""short and uncertain"" reference is under health, where the state government says that women on an average live less than 55 years in UP and that the mortality rate for children under five years is a high 141 in every thousand. It makes the comparison to Saharan Africa and admits that ""If a girl is born in Kerala she can expect to live 20 years longer than if she is born in Uttar Pradesh.""

The UP government also says on its website, ""Almost all social indicators of the state show that the state stands on 13th or 14th position among the sixteen major states. Bihar and in some cases Orissa, are the only two states which lag behind UP in terms of social development indicators like medical facilities, teacher-pupil ratio in primary schools, birth rate, death rate, infant mortality rate, literacy, per capita income, electrification of villages, per capita power consumption etc.

The Prime Minister has in his election speeches lambasted the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party, who have ruled UP by turns in the last 15 years, for what he calls a total neglect of the development of the state and its people. The BJP, PM Modi said in Maharajgunj near Gorakhpur today, wants to work for the people of UP.

The BJP, the Prime Minister said, ""is leading till the 5th phase and the 6th and 7th phase will be bonus from you all."" The question, he said, was not who would form government, ""but whether the BJP will win a two-thirds majority or a three-fourths majority.

Five rounds of voting have been held in the UP assembly elections, seen as a semi-final before the national election in 2019. After two more rounds of polling, votes will be counted on March 11."

The election is billed as a major test for Chief Minister Okram Ibobi of the Congress party, whose party is fighting the anti-incumbency wave as it completes 15 years in power in the state.

Manipur Election Watch and the ADR analysed 167 candidates who will try their luck in the first phase. Eight candidates were found to have assets over Rs 1 crore. The BJP has fielded four crorepati candidates - the most by any party. Two candidates contesting on Congress ticket were found to be crorepatis. The Democratic Front and the NCP has fielded 1 crorepati candidate each.

The campaigning for the first phase saw national leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh addressing multiple rallies throughout the state. During campaigning, there were bitter exchanges between the Congress and the BJP over the ongoing economic blockade in the state and the Naga Peace Accord.

The Naga Peace Accord was signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the Centre in August, 2015.

The economic blockade has led to shortage of essential commodities, especially fuel, in the land-locked state. The blockade in place since November 16, 2016 was imposed by the United Naga Council in protest against the state government's decision to carve out seven new districts from the existing ones.

Addressing the 'Varanasi Vyapari Sammelan' (traders meet), he hailed the Central government's demonetisation policy and said the move had won the confidence of many people.

""The demonetisation scheme was in the best interest of the countrymen. People residing in rural areas, who were once not our voters, voted for us this time due to this great step.

Our party courageously took the stand on demonetisation, which will make a positive impact on the economy of the country,"" he said.

""The world has accepted that India's economy is the fastest growing economy,"" he said.

Commenting on the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the senior BJP leader said, ""BJP is going to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh with full majority like it did at the Centre after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.""

He also hit out at the Opposition for targeting BJP for not having a chief ministerial face for the UP assembly elections.

Mr Jaitley pointed out that the electorate had chosen Narendra Modi, long before he was declared the Prime Minister nominee of BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

""During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the electorate of this country accepted Modiji first, afterwards our Bharatiya Janata party (workers) accepted him and at the end, our parliamentary board nominated him, and we even won the elections,"" he maintained.

""After 1984, it was for the first time that a political party got a clear majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls,"" he said, adding that history will be repeated in the UP elections.

Hitting out at the rival Congress, Mr Jaitley said the party was reduced to winning only 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as it ""only worked for its personal benefit, not for the nation.""

""Now BJP has become the pan India party,"" he asserted.

Mr Jaitley also attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for ""distributing tickets to criminal candidates, paving way for 'Goondaraj' (hooliganism) and doing caste-based politics.""

""Akhilesh boasts of one expressway in the state, while Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is constructing 255 highways at half the rate of the tender given by the UP government for its expressway,"" he added."

The election is billed as a major test for the Okram Ibobi Singh-led Congress government in the state which has been in power for the last 15 years.

In the first phase, 38 Assembly seats out of 60, covering both the Imphal valley and the hills, will go to the polls.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh were the star campaigners in the first phase, all of whom addressed multiple rallies.

During campaigning, there were bitter exchanges between the Congress and the BJP over the ongoing economic blockade in the state and the Naga Peace Accord.

 The Congress accused the BJP of ""compromising with the
territorial integrity"" of Manipur, an allegation the saffron
party has vociferously denied.

The Naga Peace Accord, also called the ""framework agreement"", was signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the Centre in August, 2015.

The state has been saddled with an indefinite economic blockade since November 1, 2016, imposed by the United Naga Council, causing immense hardship to the people as the supply of essential commodities, especially fuel, in the land-locked state has choked.

The blockade has been imposed on Manipur's ""lifelines"" -- national highways 2 and 37, in protest against the state government's decision to carve out seven new districts from the existing ones.

The blockade has become a major poll plank in the north-eastern state.

From Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally to BJP president Amit Shah's door-to-door campaign, the party is trying its best to replicate its sweep of Assam election last year. On the other hand, the election is billed as a major test for the Okram Ibobi Singh-led Congress government which has been in power in the state for the last 15 years. Thursday was the last day of campaigning for the first phase of the polls.

This has been a hectic poll season for Manipur with many star campaigners addressing multiple rallies. There were bitter exchanges between the Congress and the BJP over the ongoing economic blockade in the state and the Naga Peace Accord.

In the last 15 years of Ibobi Singh's rule, the state has seen many twists and turns. Frequent shutdowns and blockades have put the economic growth in the slow lane. The last week witnessed protests by youth and students asking PM Modi to make the details of the 2015 Framework Agreement public.  

""Before the election, they make lot of promises. But once they win, they don't work,"" said Sanatombi Devi, an Imphal resident.

Is BJP an alternative? Will it usher in the much-needed change? Voters aren't sure.

""The Congress party is not communal like BJP... we know Congress would not compromise with the Nagas and will safeguard integrity of the state,"" said Md Abdur Ali, resident of Lilong.

But poll arithmetic in Manipur is not that simple. Ethnic equations play a big role.

Meiteis form a major chunk of voters in 40 seats, Nagas in 20, Kukis and 30 other tribes are also decisive. The Congress split Naga-majority areas to create seven new districts. The Nagas protested the move. The centre's Framework Agreement with Nagaland's former insurgent group NSCN(IM) remains a key issue as Meities fear Manipur may lose their land to a probable Nagalim or umbrella Naga state.

While the Nagas accuse Congress of divisive politics, the Kukis don't want a rollback of the creation of new districts.

""If there is a rollback of the decision, the Kukis might hold protests,"" said S Kipgen, Kuki youth leader.

The second phase of the Assembly polls is scheduled on March 8 and the results will be declared on March 11."

Rahul Gandhi will campaign for Congress candidates at Hapta Kangjeibung ground.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently held a rally in the state where he launched a blistering attack at the Congress government. ""Manipur has been destroyed, who's responsible... The chief minister here has been sitting in Manipur for 15 years. Manipur is considered as the Switzerland of East. But do you see any development, employment for youth?"" the PM had said during his rally in Imphal.

PM Modi also accused Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh of trying to divide the people of the state. ""There has been no work done. All the government has done is pit one community against the other and get benefit from it. This should end now. All communities spread across the state should be equally benefitted,"" he added.

Former Goa RSS Sanghachalak Subhash Velingkar said a formal decision on the matter will be taken by 90-odd office-bearers of the faction by March 3 or 4.

""Re-uniting with the RSS after the February 4 assembly elections was always on the cards,"" Mr Velingkar told IANS. 

The aim of forming the rebel RSS unit in Goa was to defeat the state's BJP government which, he claimed, had taken the Sangh's teachings for granted.

Mr Velingkar was sacked by the RSS in August last year after he repeatedly accused Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and the Goa BJP of deviating from RSS teachings and betraying the cause of regional languages by allowing English medium primary schools -- most run by Goa's Roman Catholic Church -- to avail of financial grants. 

Mr Velingkar then formed a rebel Sangh outfit in Goa, which thousands of local volunteers and a majority of state RSS office-bearers joined.

Mr Velingkar, co-convenor of Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch, has accused Parrikar and the state BJP of betrayal.

Velingkar and the Manch leadership also formed a new political party -- Goa Suraksha Manch -- which contested the February 4 elections in alliance with the Shiv Sena and one of Goa's oldest regional political party -- Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party.

Velingkar said their rebellion had proved a point to the RSS top leadership and the Bharatiya Janata Party."

The state has already voted in five of the seven phases of the assembly elections, in which the party is hoping to wrest power from the ruling Samajwadi Party.

A BJP delegation led by Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi submitted a memorandum to the Election Commission, contending that there has been a large-scale deletion of names of genuine voters. This, the memorandum said, was a clear violation of the constitutional guarantees to citizens.

""The commission may institute an inquiry into such state-wide and unauthorised deletion of valid voters from the electoral rolls, fix responsibility and institute prosecution of officials responsible,"" the party said in the memorandum.

The BJP has claimed that it received complaints from almost every assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh that the names of voters have been deleted from the electoral lists without any advance warning.

The party also asked the Election Commission to ensure that all Electors Photo Identity Card holders be allowed to vote in the remaining two phases of the assembly polls. The phases 4 and 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections will be held on March 4 and March 8. The results will be declared on March 11.

Of the five states going to polls in this round - Punjab, Goa, Uttarkhand, Manipur and Uttar Pradesh - the election in the last is considered the most crucial. The 403-seat assembly happens to the largest and is considered a dress rehearsal before the 2019 general election.

"A Forgotten Village In Rahul Gandhi's Amethi Boycotts Election In Anger","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/a-forgotten-village-in-rahul-gandhis-amethi-boycotts-election-in-anger-1664397","Amethi, Uttar Pradesh:                             In Amethi, a VIP constituency courtesy Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who represents it in Parliament, the entire village of Parsauli in Uttar Pradesh did not vote in the assembly elections on Monday. They were protesting against the main road to the village not being repaired for decades.

All 649 voters in Parsauli, 339 men and 310 women boycotted the election in the fifth of seven rounds of polling. Polling booth number 120 saw not a single vote cast, officials said.

The villagers say they are bewildered at having been stricken off the map by their representatives. Parsauli is only three km away from Amethi town on the Amethi-Durgapur highway, but has had no proper road linking it for many years.

Two powerful politicians represent it - while Mr Gandhi is the member of parliament, the legislator is Gayatri Prajapati, an influential minister in the Samajwadi Party of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

KN Sharma, a retired station master of the Indian Railways, who lives in Parsauli, told news agency Press Trust of India that the road that connects the village with the highway was constructed when the Congress' Sanjay Gandhi was the MP from Amethi.

There has been no attempt to repair it since and there is simply no road left. Sanjay Gandhi, Rahul's uncle, died 37 years ago in 1980.

The BJP has accused Rahul Gandhi of neglecting Amethi, which has been a Gandhi family stronghold for years. The Gandhis - including party chief Sonia Gandhi who is Rahul's mother - have accused the BJP-led central government of punishing voters in Amethi and adjoining Rae Bareli by withholding the benefits of central schemes from them.

In the national election in 2014, only two constituencies out of UP's 80 had voted in Congress MPs - Amethi and Rae Bareli elected Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The BJP won 72 seats and Akhilesh Yadav's party had won 5.

For the UP assembly elections the Congress has partnered with the Samajwadi Party but both parties fielded candidates in the Amethi assembly seat after the Congress' Ameeta Singh insisted on contesting.

The BJP turned it into an even more high profile contest, fielding Garima Singh as its candidate. Garima Singh is the ex-wife of Sanjay Singh, locally known as the Raja or King of Amethi. Ameeta Singh is married to him now.

The Samajwadi Party has fielded its sitting legislator Mr Prajapati, against whom a first information report or FIR was registered last week in a rape case.             

85-year-old Maharajdin Yadav of Parsauli said he couldn't care less. ""No one does anything. People come and go, you think they are all blind?"" he asked angrily.

It's not just one village. Many voters complain about the lack of proper irrigation and a lack of good schools and colleges. Amethi's maternal mortality or mothers who die while giving birth, a key health indicator, is 364 per 1 lakh live births, far more than the state average of  285.

The Congress Ameeta Singh argues with the numbers. ""It is wrong to say Amethi is underdeveloped. No constituency can claim 100 per cent development but we are trying,"" she said."

A delegation of the Congress party, led by AICC general secretary Ambika Soni and Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, and other leaders also demanded an investigation into the alleged pumping of crores of rupees into the state election.

It urged the Commission to ensure that no postal votes cast after the designated time of 5.00pm in the Uttarakhand Assembly polls on February 15 be counted.

""We would like to submit that breach of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was committed by Narendra Modi ji himself, amongst others, and an FIR should be filed against the perpetrator amongst others,"" the delegation said in a memorandum submitted to the poll body.

The delegation maintained that the EC should immediately instruct the State Election Commission to file an FIR against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, J P Nadda, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank (MP), Madan Kaushik (local candidate) and other BJP leaders and party candidates who addressed/participated in the election rally for alleged ""breach of MCC which can be clearly seen from the material available in public domain"".

""The EC should also launch a probe into the pumping of huge amount of unaccounted cash during election by the BJP. Besides, the poll body should ensure that no postal votes be counted, which were cast after the designated time of 5.00pm on 15.2.2017,"" the memorandum stated.

Ms Soni and Mr Rawat told the Commission that during the election campaigning in Uttarakhand, Mr Modi held a public rally in Haridwar on February 10, without the requisite permission from the poll watchdog and thus violated the MCC.

They said, on bringing the matter to the notice of Chief Election Officer of Uttarakhand and other authorities, a showcause notice was issued and since the ""BJP had failed to convince the EC through its reply, the commission had filed an FIR against the Haridwar Unit of BJP."""

He also blamed Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for letting absconding minister and rape-accused Gayatri Prajapati letting go scot-free, calling it a worst example of poor law and order. Asked if the results will be seen as people's response to the PM Narendra Modi government's work, he said they would put their stamp of approval on its two-and-a-half-year tenure in these elections.

""The BJP has already won a majority of seats in the state assembly in the first five phases of the polls. In the next two, people will push our tally to two-thirds mark. I can say with confidence that we will get two-thirds seats,"" he said.

Mr Shah rejected the suggestion of an intensive campaign by Prime Minister Modi in Varanasi and neighbouring places and the fact that the top party brass has been camping here for days were a sign of nervousness in the saffron camp.

Wherever elections have taken place in the earlier phases, the party and its leaders have focused on campaigning and it is natural that they are in Varanasi now as it goes to the polls in the last phase, he said.

The state is seeing a similar wave in the BJP's support that was witnessed during the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 when it won 71 of the 80 seats, he claimed. Responding to Mr Yadav's barb at the BJP over its 'achhe din' (good days) claim for the country, he said, ""The 'achhe din' of Uttar Pradesh will begin from 1 P M on March 11 when the counting of votes will occur and the BJP will emerge victorious."""
"UP Elections 2017: PM Narendra Modi's Varanasi Is Ground Zero In Final Push For State","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modis-varanasi-is-ground-zero-in-final-push-for-uttar-pradesh-1664792","Varanasi: HighlightsIn last leg of UP polls, all parties plan to carpet bomb Varanasi
PM Modi will be in his constituency,Varanasi, on March 5 for rallies
Varanasi votes on March 8; counting for all rounds on March 11
                                It is destination Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as parties gear up for the last two rounds of polling in the marathon Uttar Pradesh assembly election. The elections are now in the eastern part of the massive state and polling will be held for 89 seats in 14 districts on March 4 and 8.

Over the next few days, political parties plan to carpet bomb Varanasi and adjoining areas and Saturday, March 4, will be a logistics nightmare for the local administration. PM Modi will campaign that day in his constituency while another part of UP votes, as will the Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi team and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati.

The BJP, which hopes to replicate its sweep of UP in the 2014 national elections, has moved its entire brass to eastern UP, where it has been forced to counter a rebellion by supporters of powerful local leader and priest Yogi Adityanath. They are upset that he has not been named the party's presumptive chief minister. The UP elections are seen as a bellwether for the next general elections in 2019.

PM Modi may turn his constituency into an operational base from March 3, sources said. Already camped in the region are union minister Rajnath Singh, BJP chief Amit Shah and other top central ministers. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will pass through on Sunday, on his way to Nepal for a meeting.  

On March 3, PM Modi will address a rally in Mirzapur, about 60 km away from Varanasi. The next day, he will campaign in Jaunpur, before returning to Varanasi where he will address a public meeting at Kashi Vidyapeeth. He may also visit the famous Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples.

On the same day, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party will hold a 13-km road show along with his partner and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi. Starting at 1 pm, they will travel through Varanasi's Kutchehry (court) area to Lanka, where the famous Benaras Hindu University or BHU is located, covering all three assembly segments in Varanasi city.

The Samajwadi Party also plans two public meetings in Varanasi to be addressed by Akhilesh Yadav one at Allahabad road in Varanasi and the other Ajgara before the road show.

District administration is trying to ensure that the road show and PM rally crowds get different channels for movement.

Ms Mayawati will address a public rally in Varanasi on the same day at Rohania, which much to the relief of the district administration is far from the Varanasi city and may not clash with the BJP and SP-Congress events.

With three top formations holding show of strengths on the same day, each party will make an effort to outdo the others on crowd size and thousands, even lakhs, of political workers and supporters will be out in the narrow lanes of the ancient city at the same time.  

Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Yadav from Bihar has been in Varanasi for the last two days and addressed two rallies yesterday. He may address another today, appealing for votes for Akhilesh Yadav.

Varanasi votes in the seventh and final phase and on the last day of campaigning, Amit shah will hold a road show here. PM Modi will be in Varanasi on March 5 for rallies in Pindra and Ajgara. He may spend the night in Varanasi.

Votes for all rounds of the UP elections and polling held in four other states will be counted on March 11."

"UP Elections 2017: What's In A Name? In Harijanpur, Opinion Is Divided","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-whats-in-a-name-in-harijanpur-opinion-is-divided-1662466","Harijanpur village, Chitrakoot:                             If caste equations play a dominant role in Uttar Pradesh politics, on the ground, its reflection can be seen in villages like Harijanpur. Blatantly named after castes or groupings of their residents, such villages can be found in every corner of the state. Harijanpur -- 20 km on an extremely bad road from Chitrakoot's Manikpur block and home to 530 Dalit voters -- is all set for Thursday's vote, in which they have been promised much, but not a change of name.

For villagers like Kalavati, this is the ultimate stamp of shame. ""Ghrina aati hai,"" said the 60-year-old widow, seated in a neighbour's house. The words loosely translate to feeling disgusted with the name of her village. Kalavati says she wants an immediate change - involving the removal of the word ""Harijan"".

Once popularised by Mahatma Gandhi in his fight against untouchability, the word is now considered derogatory. ""I don't like this name. If it got changed, I could go into society with more dignity,"" she said.

Sitting nearby, 50-year-old farmer Ramakant chips in: ""Earlier, we raised this name change demand and this was converted into a Ambedkar gram in Mayawati's tenure. That scheme lasted for three years and that's the only time we saw any development,"" he says.

At the village well, scores of women can be seen with a list of demands usual in this part of the country which is drought hit and impoverished. Their three key demands are a decent road, irrigation for crops and employment.

Further ahead in the village, we meet Ashish and Arjun, both in their early 20s, who say forget names, the biggest issue here is migration. Ashish has just returned from a factory in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar, Arjun from Jaipur. Local-level employment, they say, is the big issue. Not the name of the village.

""When I go out, I just say I'm from Chitrakoot. That's how we are identified anyway,"" says Arjun. ""I think the impact of caste is coming down in our society,"" adds Ashish.

Asked about the only political presence in the village -- a Mayawati sticker pasted outside a thatched hut - he said, ""We will vote for the person who works and does some good for us""."
"UP Polls 2017: Prannoy Roy On Why 'New Voters' Of 2014 Are Essential For BJP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-polls-2017-prannoy-roy-on-why-new-voters-of-2014-are-essential-for-bjp-1663260","Lucknow:                             India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh is more than halfway through the 2017 Assembly Elections - seen as the bellwether for the general elections two years later. The critical question for the election is whether the BJP - which swept the state in the 2014 general elections - will be able to repeat the success or if the Samajwadi Party - which has tied up this year with the Congress - be able to script a sequel to its 2012 state poll landslide. As both the top ambassadors for the election - Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - claim to be working towards moulding the election narrative towards development, it remains to be seen how much of the politics in the battleground state is still influenced by religion and caste. NDTV's Prannoy Roy and election experts analyse what it will take for the parties to win the prized battle in the state seen as most critical to India's political discourse.

Demonetisation or the central government's move to ban large notes in a bid to curb corruption and tax evasion, a real pain a few months ago, has eased, says senior journalist Shekhar Gupta. But as much as people vote on economic issues, caste remains an undeniably key factor in UP elections.

Here's a look at how different castes voted in 2014 Lok Sabha and 2012 Assembly elections:


Caste still influences political allegiances in Uttar Pradesh, shows a ground survey in the state. But the other factor that affects which party gets the mandate is the age of the voter.

Akhilesh Yadav who swept the 2012 election will need to rely greatly on the young vote once again if he is to make a return. The question is, will the youth factor work for Akhilesh Yadav?


But for the BJP, it will be 'new voters' and a focus on vote banks that will be key to win the 2017 Assembly Elections:


On the campaign trail, NDTV spoke to BJP's Rajnath Singh - one of the party's tallest leaders in the state.
 
The Union Home Minister says the BJP did not select Muslim candidates because winnability is a factor. ""A confusion has been created in the minds of minorities about us. That will go with time,"" he says.

But will the fact that the BJP has not declared a Chief Ministerial candidate will it hurt the party? No, says Mr Singh. Would he like to be chief minister? ""Humko kaun poochh raha hai? (Who's asking me?)"" said the 65-year-old BJP leader.

And what about politics of polarisation? Are party chief Amit Shah's and PM Narendra Modi's latest speeches invoking Diwali, Eid a deviation from the party's 'development agenda'? ""No. The attempt is never to polarise. I read the PM's speech carefully. It was all about ending appeasement and discrimination,"" Mr Singh said.

On the fight against black money, one of the BJP's foremost election issues, Rajnath Singh seemed to duck a direct question if the use of unaccounted wealth had been curbed. ""But at least our government has taken a step in that direction, even if its a centimetre,"" he said.

As much as the election is a prestige battle for PM Narendra Modi, it is also for Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. To retain power, the Samajwadi Party, which has allied with the Congress this time, must win back 'traditional voters' it lost to BJP in 2014 elections:


Mulayam Singh had an incredible ability to bring together figureheads from different communities to the Samajwadi Party's advantage. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav however has a different style.
 ""We respect the Prime Minister. He has gone from Uttar Pradesh. But he says too many small things. MODI to us stands for Model of Dividing India. And he hasn't done anything for the people,"" says Mr Yadav.

On his feud with his father Mulayam Singh and uncle Shivpal Yadav, which divided the party just ahead of the polls, he said, ""This is Netaji's (Mulayam Singh) party. He is our mentor. After results on March 11, whatever decision he takes, will be final.""

The third contender for power in Uttar Pradesh, BSP, is focusing on forward caste and Muslim voters to make a comeback:

The BSP has the toughest of climbs. If Mayawati's party does end up being the No. 3 outfit, will she ally with her archenemy Samajwadi Party or the BJP? That may be the biggest plot twist in the end."
"UP Election 2017: Fifth Phase Candidate Include 168 Crorepatis, 117 With Criminal Cases","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-2017-fifth-phase-candidate-include-168-crorepatis-117-with-criminal-cases-1663163","New Delhi:                             In phase five of Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections on Monday, a total of 168 crorepati candidates are contesting and 117 have declared criminal cases against themselves, a report released on Friday said.

"'The Snake Of Victory': How To Win Uttar Pradesh This Year","http://www.ndtv.com/elections-news/the-snake-of-victory-how-to-win-uttar-pradesh-this-year-1662872","Lucknow:                             The Uttar Pradesh ""snake of victory"" shows that a party or coalition will need 35 per cent of the total votes to get a majority in the state, where assembly elections are being held in seven phases. Majority in the 403-member UP assembly is 202 seats.

In 2012, when the Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav rode a wave to victory, his party had needed far less, 29 per cent vote share, to win 226 seats. Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party or BSP with 26 per cent votes could win just 80 seats. In many seats that the Samajwadi Party had won, the difference between its candidate and the number 2, mostly the BSP candidate, was less than 1 per cent.

But that year, the two regional giants were the primary actors in UP, with national parties the BJP and the Congress coming in a distant third and fourth.
 Two years later, in 2014, the BJP flipped UP's politics over with a Modi wave, sweeping 73 of the state's 80 parliament seats along with ally Apna Dal - 71 on its own - equal to 337 assembly seats. Its vote share, a whopping 43 per cent.

The party hopes to replicate that in the assembly elections this year and end a 15-year drought in UP.
 The Samajwadi Party's 22 per cent vote share in 2014 earned it five seats - equal to 42 assembly seats. The Congress' eight per cent vote share got it two Lok Sabha seats, that of party chief Sonia Gandhi and her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi - equal to 15 assembly seats.   

This time the Samajwadi Party has partnered with the Congress in a bid to consolidate their overlapping vote banks - like the Muslim vote - and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said he expects the coalition to win 300 seats. It will need upwards of 40 per cent vote share for that in what is seen as a close three-cornered election.

For the BJP to win in 2017, it will need to hold on to the new voters it acquired in 2014, most prominently the Jat vote. Traditionally 10 per cent Jats, concentrated in western UP, have voted for the BJP. But in the deeply polarised national elections, held months after deadly communal violence between Jats and Muslims in 2013, 75 per cent Jats voted for the BJP.
 The BJP also got 75 per cent of the forward caste vote; traditionally 40 per cent of UP's forward caste voters have voted for the party. It also benefited from extra votes from non-Jatav Dalit voters and non-Yadav voters from Other Backward Castes or OBCs.

Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane's name emerged in a video in which his former driver claims to have witnessed the BJP leader shooting dead a man. The driver was detained by police after the video went viral on social media.

""Witness Pandurang Adarkar who is from Kolhapur in Maharashtra has been detained. He has confessed to being witness to the murder of one Shanu Gaonkar, who is missing since 2006,"" inspector Dipak Pednekar was quoted by news agency PTI.

In the video that has gone viral, Mr Adarkar purportedly claimed he was witness to Mr Rane shooting Mr Gaonkar dead in Sattari tehsil of Goa in 2006 to avenge the killing of his brother Prithviraj Rane.

 Prithviraj Rane was murdered at Saleli village of Sattari tehsil in 2005.

Preliminary inquiry had begun under the supervision of Superintendent of Police Karthik Kashyap, the inspector told PTI.

Police have not arrested anyone in connection with the case, but claim that the statements of all the people named by Mr Adarkar would be recorded. The police officer, however, ruled out questioning Mr Rane at this juncture.

Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane has not responded to the allegation levelled against him.

Mr Rane contested against Congress' Pratapsinh Rane from Poriem constituency during the assembly elections held earlier this month. A high voter turnout of over 83 per cent was recorded in the Assembly polls in Goa, which were held on February 4. The ruling BJP is engaged in a fierce fight with the Opposition Congress, AAP and an alliance of MGP, Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch for the 40-member House.

"UP Elections 2017: Dimple Yadav Comes Up With New 'Kasab' Acronym","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-dimple-yadav-comes-up-with-new-kasab-acronym-1663805","Jaunpur:                             In the latest addition to the growing list of acronyms in the ongoing Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, SP MP from Kannauj Dimple Yadav today redefined 'Kasab' - the abbreviation coined by BJP chief Amit Shah.

""BJP says 'Ka' stands for Congress. Your Akhilesh bhaiyya says 'Ka' (in Hindi) stands for Computer, 'Sa' stands for smartphone, through which you can get all the information about the policies of the government and 'B' stands for 'bachche' (children),"" Dimple, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said at an election rally amid loud applause.

The ruling Samajwadi Party has a scheme to distribute laptops to meritorious students and promised to give smartphones if it returns to power in the state.

Mr Shah at a rally last week at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur had used the 'KASAB' acronym to describe 'Ka' for Congress, 'Sa' for SP and 'B' for BSP.

Mr Shah coined the acronym matching the name of terrorist Ajmal Kasab - one of the perpetrators of 26/11 Mumbai attack.

Akhilesh had earlier hit out at the BJP chief for his ""Kasab"" barb, saying ""Ka"" actually stood for ""kabutar"" (pigeon), while BSP supremo Mayawati had said, ""There cannot be a bigger Kasab than him"" and dubbed Shah a ""terrorist"".

Dimple said SP would give 35 per cent reservation to women, and pregnant women would get foodgrains delivered at their doorstep.

""If SP is voted to power, we will do away with the age-limit for women in Class-III and IV government jobs,"" she said.

The Kannauj MP also said that for every gas stove purchased, her party would give a pressure cooker.

Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said, ""The people of the country while listening to PM's 'Mann ki Baat' have not realised how the prices of LPG cylinders have gone up""."
"Insurgents Impose Curfew, Call For Boycott As PM Narendra Modi Visits Manipur Tomorrow","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/insurgents-impose-curfew-call-for-boycott-as-pm-narendra-modi-visits-manipur-tomorrow-1663011","Imphal:                             The top body of six insurgent groups in Manipur, the Coordinating Committee (Corcom) has imposed a curfew from 6 am on Saturday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Manipur tomorrow to address a public gathering ahead of the assembly election in the state. The Coordinating Committee said that the curfew shall remain effective till Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves Imphal after his electioneering.

Police said that security measures have been heightened to ensure that there is no law and order problem during PM Modi's hour-long visit. A statement issued by the Corcom has levelled serious charges against the government, including accusing it of driving a wedge between communities who have been living in peace and harmony for generations.

Local residents have been told not to venture out during the curfew. However media and those in essential services will be exempt. Police said, ""During such curfews people usually stay indoors and do not stick out their necks."" There has always been a thin attendance at public functions, they said.

To ensure that the insurgents-led boycott is not taken lightly by locals, at times some stray incidents of violence takes place to discourage people.

The ruling Congress party has been saying in their election meetings, that during his visit, PM Modi should spell out the details of the agreement he signed with militant organisation NSCN(IM). Students and women activists have been demanding the disclosure of the details of the agreement, they said."
"NSCN(IM) Claims Centre Has Recognised Legal Rights On 'Naga Integration'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nscn-im-claims-centre-has-recognised-legal-rights-on-naga-integration-1663299","Guwahati, Assam:                             In what might create political ripples ahead of assembly elections in Manipur next week, the Naga rebel group NSCN(IM), which has signed a Framework Agreement with the centre for the Naga peace deal, on Friday claimed that the centre has recognised the legal rights of the Nagas and proclaimed “integration the legitimate rights of the Nagas.” 

The NSCN(IM), in a press statement, also claimed that there will be a transformation in the history of the Naga very soon.

The framework agreement inked between the centre and the NSCN(IM) is a key election issue in Manipur.

 NSCN(IM) has also claimed that there are some individuals trying to sabotage the peace talks between them and the central government by projecting a new means as “Nagas of Nagaland”.

The ruling Congress in Manipur has been claiming that the BJP is hand in gloves with NSCN(IM) and United Naga Council or UNC and they are the architect of the economic blockade, which has been on for nearly four months. To counter this campaign, last week Home Minister Rajnath Singh claimed at a poll rally in Imphal that there is ‘no mention of Manipur’ in the framework agreement since August 2015. 

Various student and civil society groups in Imphal valley have been demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi disclose the clauses of the framework agreement signed in August 2015 with the NSCN(IM). 

The Congress’s main campaign has been on protecting Manipur's territorial integrity against the concept of greater Nagalim (Integration of Naga areas in Northeast). 

The statement by NSCN(IM) came a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first election rally in Imphal. Manipur will go to polls in two phases on March 4 and 8 for its 60 member legislative assembly. While the Congress has been in power for 15 years, the BJP has gained ground and emerged as the main opposition party to the Congress in this election with several Congress leaders switching to the BJP camp. Votes will be counted on March 11."

"UP Elections 2017: Volunteers Fan Out With Personal Letter From Akhilesh Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-volunteers-fan-out-with-personal-letter-from-akhilesh-yadav-1663280","Lucknow:                             As leaders of all major parties are channelising their energies in campaigning for the last three phases of polling in Uttar Pradesh, an army of volunteers from SP and Congress is reaching out to voters with a personal letter from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

Armed with campaign material and dressed in white T-shirts that read 'phir se Akhilesh' and 'UP ko ye saath pasand hai', these volunteers are reaching out to voters and households across the districts which are slated to go to polls.

The volunteers carry with them the alliances' 10 key priorities - Pragati ke Das Kadam, pictures of Akhilesh and Rahul with the 'UP ko yeh saath pasand hai' slogan and a pocket calendar, besides a personalised message from Akhilesh Yadav.

Said to be the brainchild of Congress' election strategist Prashant Kishor's team, around 70-100 volunteers per assembly constituency visit upto 5 lakh homes daily, in a bid to give a personal touch to the electioneering.

Elections for UP Legislative Assembly are being held in seven phases with three more to follow on February 27, March 4 and 8. The results will be out on March 11.

Interestingly, the letter signed by Mr Yadav is printed on a sheet of paper which has a band of SP and Congress colours running across it. In the letter, the Chief Minister expresses confidence that people would give him a second chance for taking forward the work initiated by his government.

""We initiated several works in the past five years for development and also got success in many schemes but there still remains a long way to go...a big structure has to be built on the foundations laid and it is important that this vikas ki yatra is not slowed down,"" he states in the letter titled 'Akhilesh ka sandesh'.

""We want to bring the state in the category of most developed states for which works have been done speedingly and now we have also got the support of Congress and Rahulji which will give it more momentum,"" Mr Yadav has stated adding he has confidence that people will support the alliance."
"Manipur Election 2017: Will State Replicate 'Arunachal Model', Voters Wonder","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-election-2017-will-the-state-walk-in-arunachal-pradeshs-footsteps-1663460","Imphal:                             Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Imphal, the Congress said that PM Modi will have no impact in Manipur whereas the BJP is confident that he will bring down the curtains on the Congress' 15-year rule in the state.

The BJP, which is contesting all 60 constituencies, has never fought Manipur so seriously. It is fighting the election, scheduled for March 4, without an alliance with the regional parties, who are its allies outside Manipur. Former Congress minister N Biren, who recently joined the BJP, said the party will sweep the polls.

""We are not having any pre-poll alliance. That can be considered post-poll. If they want to join, they are most welcome,"" said Mr Biren.

But both sides, BJP and Congress, have a common worry: narrow wins or even a hung assembly and that has, suddenly, put the phrase, 'The Arunachal Model',  on everyone's lips.

Last year, Arunachal Pradesh saw at least three different chief ministers, many more ministers and legislators change party colours at the speed of light. The BJP, now, runs the state.

""No place for the push and pull of the Arunachal model. We will have a single majority,"" Mr Biren said.

Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh said the BJP does not have a chance and there is no question of replicating the Arunachal Pradesh model in Manipur.

""Manipur is not Arunachal... They will not succeed. Yes, six MLAs have quit. But those who have defected, they are suicidal. Their career is finished,"" said Mr Singh.

Manipuris, trying to do the math, see uncertain times ahead.

""It will be a hung Assembly and then, the party in power at the Centre will have an influence here,"" said Pradip Phanjoubam, editor of the Imphal Free Press.

""Defections and difficulties of rounding up MLAs from smaller parties could make things difficult for Congress,"" he added.

The Congress lost Assam to BJP after a 15-year stint. In Manipur, however, it may be a tougher nut to crack. But that, itself, may push the state into Arunachal Pradesh's footstep."
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Promises To End Economic Blockade In Manipur: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-prime-minister-narendra-modi-speech-at-rally-in-manipurs-imphal-1663372","Imphal:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a public meeting in Manipur's capital Imphal. Polls for the 60-member legislative assembly of the northeastern state will be held in two phases on March 4 and March 8. The election is expected to be a high-octane, virtual contest between the ruling Congress - which has ruled the state for 15 years - and the BJP. Over the last six months, many senior Congress members, including ministers, have shifted their allegiance to the BJP. However, the BJP is contesting the polls without its key regional allies National People's Party, Naga People's Front and the Lok Janshakti Party, who are all contesting the election separately.

Insurgents in the state have called for a curfew from 6 am on Saturday, ahead of the Prime Minister's scheduled visit. Situation is Manipur has been tense ever since the United Naga Council imposed an economic blockade, which has affected daily life of voters.

Here are the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech:Today, the first thing I want do is make a complaint. Will you be offended?When, in 2014, I came here before the Lok Sabha elections, the ground was not full. Today, it is full of people.I can't complain but only thank you for the love.Manipur has been coloured with the colours of the BJP. In a few days, there will be celebrations.The chief minister here has been sitting in Manipur for 15 years.Manipur is considered as the Switzerland of East. But do you see any development, employment for youth?Manipur has been destroyed, who's responsible? (People chant, ""Congress"")The Congress which has so many sins, does it have any right to be in power for even a day? Will you wipe them completely this time?There has been no work done. All the Congress government has done is pit one community against the other and get benefit from it.This should end now.All communities spread across the state should equally benefit.I urge you to let BJP serve the people of Manipur. Just give us 5 years; you have given them 15 years. In 15 months, we'll do what they haven't.Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made a separate ministry for the north-eastern states.Then the next 10 years, there was such a government in Delhi that it destroyed all the progress. They just thought of the number of MPs from the state.The question is not about number of MPs. It's about giving my brothers and sisters who live far away from Delhi an equal opportunity.Any Chief Minister from the north-east who wants to meet me is always welcome.When there's a NSC meeting, our minister stays here to find a solution.When Morarji Desai was the Prime Minister, he came for an NSC meeting. I was the first prime minister after 40 years who came here for the meeting.Look at Sikkim: it's developing at a fast pace. But wherever there is Congress, no state is developing.Manipur has one of the worst figures of people below poverty line.Jobs have been categorized according to different rates. If you want to be a teacher - pay a certain amount; same for being a cop or a chef at a minister's house. How is this allowed to go on?The Congress in Manipur does not want to light the bulbs in your house. They think if there's electricity, the people will buy TVs which will give news of the money sent to the state and not spent on its people.Even when the Centre gives them electricity, they have no intention to develop the state.Youth from Manipur and northeast have been working to safeguard Delhi. This is an example of their strength. I have urged to have northeastern people recruited in the security forces to show the country their strength.When, at 8 pm on November 8, I demonetised 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, Congress leaders were startled. They couldn't fathom the consequences.The money that they have looted, I will take it back and use it for the development of the people.These people don't care about cultures in India or the nation but just their seats.People talk about the accord with the Nagas. I want to ask the state government, were you sleeping for 1.5 years? We had informed about the accord with all details a year and a half ago. Now when the elections have been announced, they are spreading rallies.I, standing on the holy land of Manipur, promise you that there's not even one word in any accord which is against the interests of Manipuris.Isn't it the state government's responsibility to provide essential commodities such as sugar and salt, medicines and pulses?Still there are protests on the streets. People don't have grains. What kind of a government is that?Results of polls will be announced on March 11. The country will celebrate Holi on March 13. I promise you I will not let any blockade stop the celebration.Why shouldn't the blockades be removed? Why shouldn't there be a police case against rioters?

They give you two choices: one that costs 45,000 rupees and will give you up to six years of life, or the other which costs 1,30,000 will stay for a lifetime. So the poor are forced to choose. How can poor get 1 lakh plus?I called the manufacturers to reduce the cost of these stents to Rs 7,000 from 45,000 and Rs 25,000 from 1,30,000.Everything has rates - money is needed to get a job, needed to get a college seat.Son tells his mother that I need 2 lakh to get a degree which will get me a job.

Today, the terrorists tried to disrupt the campaigning of Manipur Deputy Chief Minister and Congress candidate from Nungba constituency G Gaikhangam twice by opening fire - one security personnel was injured.

According to Manipur police sources, terrorists today ambushed an advance security team which was on its way to make free passage for the VIPs and VVIPs who were attending the flag hoisting ceremony of Deputy Chief Minister G Gaikhangam at his native village Khoupum in Noney district, 90 km away from state capital Imphal.

The terrorists ambushed the security convoy at two places in Noney district this morning around 9. There were 20 police vehicles in the convoy which was on road opening patrol duty.

""As soon as the convoy reached Thingkhongjang some heavily armed militants ambushed the team from two sides. The police team too retaliated and the gunfight took place for some minutes. The armed militants reportedly fled the area,"" a statement from Manipur police added.

In the ambush, one constable of Manipur - Yumnam Jenish - was injured and later hospitalised.

Deputy Chief Minister's convoy however passed through the areas safely.  

Police sources added that the ambush might have been carried out to sabotage the Deputy Chief Minister's political campaign.

Later, Congress spokesperson Khumukcham Joykishan Singh alleged that an armed group called Zeliangrong United Front (ZUP) has been openly supporting a BJP candidate  Adim Panmei in Nungba Assembly Constituency."
"Kasab Needs To Go From Uttar Pradesh: What Amit Shah Meant","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kasab-needs-to-go-from-uttar-pradesh-what-amit-shah-meant-1662430","In the battle of acronyms in Uttar Pradesh, where political discourse during campaigning for assembly polls has been increasingly corrosive, Amit Shah today added a new one - KASAB. The name of the 26/11 terrorist, when deconstructed, means Congress, Samajwadi Party and BSP, the BJP president said at a rally today. ""Until Uttar Pradesh gets rid of K-A-S-A-B, there will be no development in the state. Ka (in Hindi) is for Congress, Sa for Samajwadi Party and Ba for BSP,"" Mr Shah said in Chauri Chaura, a historic town in Uttar Pradesh. He did not even finish the last bit, letting the crowd guess it.

Ajmal Kasab, the only among the Pakistani attackers caught after the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, was hanged in 2012.

""Until Kasab is laid to rest, development and prosperity will continue to elude UP,"" Mr Shah said.

Reacting to the BJP chief's dig, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Mau Singhvi said, ""There is a need to end acronyms... BJP's repulsive thinking has been brought out. It shows the party's communal mindset.""

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi came up with SCAM while addressing his first rally in Uttar Pradesh. ""SCAM is Samajwadi, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati,"" he said, drawing a roar of approval from the crowd.

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's reply came in Kanpur, where he said that the word stands for - ""Service, Courage, Ability and Modesty"".

How, wondered PM Modi in parliament, could anyone see anything positive in the word.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made another attempt - ""Save Country from Amit Shah and Modi.""

This week, PM Modi described Mayawati's BSP or Bahujan Samaj Party as ""Behenji Sampatti (property) Party"".

Mayawati shot back, calling BJP ""Bharatiya Jumla (rhetoric) Party"". The former chief minister also used PM Modi's initials to call him ""Mr Negative Dalit Man.""

Uttar Pradesh is half-way through seven-phase voting. The results will be declared on March 11."

An FIR has been filed against him in this regard.

Inspector in-charge of the Civil Lines police station Arun Kumar Tyagi said the FIR was filed upon the complaint of Sector Magistrate Sunil Kumar Singh.

The FIR was followed up by an inquiry ordered by District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar into allegations of Mr Maurya wearing the party sticker on the pocket of his jacket the day he came to cast his vote at a polling booth, set up on the premises of a college in the city on February 23.

Responding to queries from reporters yesterday, Mr Maurya said, ""I did not intentionally go to the polling booth wearing the party sticker. I wear the sticker on my front pocket always and it has become a habit.
""I just forgot to take it off while going inside. I would, however, respect any action taken by the EC in this regard.""

A section of the Representation of the People Act forbids any person to exhibit any notice or sign relating to the election on the day of polling within a distance of 100m of the polling station. Contravention of any of the provisions of the section, which place a number of other restrictions enforceable on polling days, is punishable with fine.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh is halfway through the 2017 assembly elections with the fifth phase of polling for 51 seats, comprising 11 districts, being due on February 27. Campaigning for the same ended on Saturday."
"As Doubts About Rahul Gandhi Grow, Leaders Wonder 'Who Will Bell The Cat?'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-doubts-about-rahul-gandhi-grow-leaders-wonder-who-will-bell-the-cat-1663586","New Delhi: HighlightsCongress suffered a loss in the Maharashtra and Odisha local polls
Officially, they blame infighting and lack of resources for the loss
The party has been losing state after state since the 2014 Union polls
                                The knives are out in the Congress party after it suffered another electoral debacle in the local elections of Maharashtra and Odisha. Officially, the party blames infighting and the lack of financial resources for its poor performance. However, senior leaders within the Congress party have now begun to question the abilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi - albeit in hushed voices.

Sources say, they are waiting for the outcomes of the ongoing elections in five states before raising the pitch of those questions. The big question, as one senior Congress leader says, is ""Who will bell the cat and question him?""

After the party's worst performance in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, Rahul Gandhi has taken the lead and tried to rebuild and campaign for the party across the country. But the results have been far from encouraging. The party has been losing state after state and has been virtually wiped out across the country.

Senior leaders in the party say there is no gameplan or strategy put forth on how to take on the Narendra Modi-led BJP government. Leaders, who requested not to be named, say Rahul Gandhi's attacks have been a non-starter and the recent victory of the BJP in Maharashtra and Odisha will have its impact on the last phase of voting in Uttar Pradesh. They also feel the long-awaited reshuffle will really bring little to the table as accountability and performance have never been the yardstick for the Mr Gandhi's leadership. The demand will, now, once again focus on whether Rahul Gandhi will be made the Congress president and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, play a more pro-active role.

Either way, the Gandhis are well aware that come March 11, any further political reversals will not only mean a big question mark on the Congress but particularly the abilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi."
"Manipur Elections 2017: Irom Sharmila Picks A David vs Goliath Fight For Thoubal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-irom-sharmila-picks-a-david-vs-goliath-fight-for-thoubal-1663547","Thoubal:                             With just one week left for Manipur elections, Thoubal is right now the most keenly watched seat in the assembly polls where activist-turned-politician Irom Sharmila is taking on three-time Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh. Far from being dismissive of her, he says, he too began his political career as an independent. But Irom Sharmila wants to be the Chief Minister now.

""I want to be Chief Minister of Manipur and bring real democracy and real true relationship between people and ruler,"" said Irom Sharmila on her campaign trail. She is single minded. But her party- Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) - has fielded candidates in only three out of 60 seats. So the math doesn't add up. And her meetings in people's courtyards or at street corners are thinly attended.

Congress rallies are, in contrast, packed. At an inauguration of some Congress candidates, where Ibobi Singh was present, the turnout was huge. Reversed parallels of David versus Goliath are hard to miss.

Mr Ibobi Singh, however, is diplomatic. Even his voters respect Irom Sharmila for her valiant fight against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA in the state. ""Everybody has the right to contest an election. She is my sister, Irom Sharmila. She is most welcome. Let the people decide,"" said Ibobi Singh.

But voters are divided, and sharply. One of them said he had no idea who she was. ""I have heard her name but I have never seen her or heard people talking about her,"" a young man said. Another man, however, is sure Irom Sharmila will win. ""Ibobi will lose,"" he says.

Even Irom Sharmila's own party PRJA is talking of moral victory and the next polls. ""She has struggled campaigning in Thoubal for various reasons. But this is just our first foray into electoral politics. Five years later, I am quite confident we are going to be a much larger party,"" Erendro Leichombam, convenor and candidate of the party said.

A Manipuri tradition is for voters to bring gifts to candidates - rice, vegetables and such. These gifts are pouring in at Congress meetings. Irom Sharmila may not care for this feudal tradition of gifts but she needs votes. She is cycling on. But the ride seems uphill.

Manipur will vote in two phases on March 4 and 8. The counting of votes will take place on March 11."
"What Facts? 'Public Opinion Counts,' Says BJP's Yogi Adityanath","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-facts-public-opinion-counts-says-bjps-yogi-adityanath-1662241","HighlightsBJP MP Yogi Adityanath represents Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur constituency
He is among the BJP's tallest leaders in eastern Uttar Pradesh
He said power supply on Diwali should be 'four times more' than on Eid
                                Yogi Adityanath, BJP lawmaker and star campaigner in Uttar Pradesh, today offered his own, fact-free interpretation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comments on Sunday alleging religious discrimination by the state's Samajwadi Party government.

The PM had said at a rally, ""There should be no discrimination. If there is land given for kabristan (graveyards), there must be provisions for shamshaanghat (crematoriums). Electricity must be provided on Ramzan and Diwali. If there is power for Holi, it must be available for Eid.""

The All India Power Engineers Association however has clarified that on Eid last year, 13,500 MW of electricity was generated, and that on the 4 auspicious days of Diwali, the figure was 15,400 MW per day, suggesting the absence of bias.

To this, the Yogi told this interviewer to ""stop quoting data"". What counts, he said, is public opinion.

""People's anger is evidence. When people come on the streets, no evidence is necessary,"" he insisted.

The saffron-robed lawmaker also asserted, somewhat bizzarely, that he believed that going by the demographics, power supply on Diwali should be ""four times more"" than on Eid.

Yogi Adityanath said he ""agreed with the Prime Minister that SP vikas (development) is limited to graveyards"".

The BJP has alleged that Rs 1,300 crores were allotted for a graveyard scheme compared to Rs 627 crores for crematoriums.

Asked whether the Prime Minister should have laboured a point that involves a fraction of the state's budget of Rs 3.46 lakh crores, the firebrand politician said, ""the Budget should be spent according to the population. It may be a small matter for you""

He then pivoted, making it a larger problem of the misuse, or lack of use, of the state's funds. ""If it is a fraction of the budget, where did the rest of the money go?"", he asked.  

Recently, Yogi Adityanath's supporters in eastern Uttar Pradesh threatened to field rebels if he was not named presumptive Chief Minister in UP, which is half-way through seven-phase elections.

The 44-year-old, however, distanced itself from the rebel outfit. ""The outfit will not damage the BJP's prospects,"" he asserted. ""I am not a candidate. I want a BJP worker to become Chief Minister.""

Yogi Adityanath, a big crowd-puller for the BJP in eastern Uttar Pradesh, has been assigned a chopper to zip across the state to campaign as the party tries to win back the politically vital state after 15 years."
"UP Elections 2017: As Parties Make Promises, Bundelkhand Migrants Say Little Has Changed","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-as-parties-make-promises-bundelkhand-migrants-say-little-has-changed-1662491","Greater Noida:                             As 19 constituencies across seven districts of Bundelkhand prepare to vote in the fourth phase of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, NDTV visited a labour chowk in Greater Noida, which has been a hub for migrants from Bundelkhand for the past two decades.

20-year-old Arvind Varma has been frequenting the labour chowk each day for the last 15 years in search of daily jobs that fetch him around Rs 300 a day.

""There are water problems, no roads and no accountability in Bundelkhand. As labour, it would mean literally walking in to the hands of exploitation,"" says Mr Varma, who now works as a cook at night and a manual labourer by day.

 Drought and declining agriculture forced him and his family to migrate from Jhansi to the outskirts of Dadri nearly 20 years ago, a time when Bundelkhand was severely drought-ridden and one of the poorest regions in the country.

For 35-year-old Pappu, a former-farmer from a neighbouring village in Jhansi who has five family-members to feed by himself, even migration seems to have offered little.

""We get Rs 350 here; in Bundelkhand I would make Rs 150. I am a farmer, so manual work is all I can do. I have heard in the elections some party is promising to cancel all farmers’ debts in Bundelkhand, is that true,"" he asks.

Like Arvind and Pappu, nearly 1,000 Bundelkhandis show up at the Greater Noida labour chowk daily, some travelling for six to seven hours from the heart of UP every day.""

If we don’t have anything to eat, what else will we do? I have come today and will go back tomorrow to cast my vote,” says 47-year-old Bhanwri Devi, from Mahoba. “But what is the point? They make us vote and then smother our faces,"" she adds.

Inder Prakash from Chitrakoot adds, ""There is no employment even here. After the note-ban, we can’t even get our wages. So much for political promises.""

Last year alone drought conditions in Bundelkhand forced nearly 18 lakh people to migrate to Delhi and its neighbouring areas. According to some estimates, nearly 10 per cent of Bundelkhand’s population migrated at that time."

Uttar Pradesh has seen record seizure of Rs 115.70 crore cash, 20.29 lakh barrels of liquor worth Rs 57.69 crore, and narcotics weighing 2,725 kg worth Rs 7.91 crore, as per the progressive data recorded till yesterday of seizure made by the Election Commission-appointed surveillance teams.

The comparative figures for the detection and seizure of these illegal inducements in UP during the 2012 Assembly polls stood at Rs 36.29 crore cash and over 3,073 litres of liquor worth Rs 6.61 lakh.

A similar massive increase in seizure has also been noticed in Uttarakhand, where single-phase polls ended early this month, as Rs 3.40 crore suspected cash, 1.01 lakh litres liquor worth Rs 3.10 crore and over 81 kg of drugs worth Rs 37.88 lakh have been seized by these teams till now.

Polling in one seat (Karnprayag) of the state has been postponed as a candidate had died.

The comparative figures for seizure in the hill state during 2012 stood at Rs 1.30 crore cash, 15,151 litres of liquor worth Rs 15.15 lakh among others.

In Punjab, where the polls have ended now, the cash seizure this time stood at Rs 58.02 crore as compared to Rs 11.51 crore last elections, 12.43 lakh litres of liquor worth Rs 13.36 crore as compared to over 3,2978 litres worth Rs 2.59 crore and 2,598 kg drugs worth Rs 18.26 crore as compared to 53 kg worth Rs 54 crore during the 2012 Assembly polls.

Goa too has witnessed a similar trend with Rs 2.24 crore cash being seized at the end of one-phase polls on February 4, over 76,000 litres liquor worth Rs 1.07 crore.

The cash seizure in the beach state during last polls was a mere Rs 60 lakh while the drugs and liquor seizure was very less. The comparative figures of the seizure for Manipur, where polls will be held next month, could not be obtained.

""It looks like demonetisation has not affected those who deal in black money and other illegal inducements used to lure the voters before and during the polls season.

""The surveillance teams are, however, on their toes to thwart these efforts as much as possible,"" a senior Income Tax department official, involved in these operations, said.

The counting of votes for all the five states will take place on March 11.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati were among the host of leaders who made a beeline to backward and water-scarce Bundelkhand region, which also figures in phase-IV of polling.

Assembly segments in Congress President Sonia Gandhi's Raebareli Lok Sabha constituency will also go to polls in this phase.

Other districts going to polls in the fourth phase are Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur.

During the highly surcharged campaigning, PM Modi repeatedly targeted the SP-Congress alliance and the BSP for corruption in their regime.

""SCAM stands for SP, Congress, Mr Akhilesh and Ms Mayawati,"" was PM Modi's refrain when he appealed to the voters of Bundelkhand to get rid of them.

As the prime minister termed BSP as ""Behenji Sampatti Party"", Ms Mayawati in her instant retort said the initials of Narendra Damodardas Modi stood for ""Mr. Negative Dalit Man"", escalating political temperature with such tit-for-tat barbs.

""Narendra Damodardas Modi means Mr. Negative Dalit Man, he is anti-dalit...this negative dalit man does not like that common people give small contributions in running the BSP movement which is also run through donations,"" an irked Ms Mayawati said.

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav held a roadshow in Allahabad, while racing against time BJP president Amit Shah held a parallel roadshow in 'Sangam Nagari', as Allahabad is also called, claiming that the BJP was poised for absolute majority.

Amid the verbal free-for-all, Mr Akhilesh referred to an advertisement of the tourism department of Gujarat, where PM Modi was Chief Minister before assuming the office of prime minister.

But PRJA has already notched up one small victory over the BJP, and its face for Manipur polls - Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The BJP - that was keen its star campaigner PM Modi holds his election rally at the historic Kangla Fort complex perhaps as a mark of symbolism in politics - has chucked its plan. Kangla Fort wasn't just home to the kings of Manipur, but is also seen as a sacred place in the Manipuri society.

PRJA - that had launched a campaign against using the fort for PM Modi's political rally - had also complained to the Election Commission. The ruling Congress too soon joined the chorus against the location for the PM's rally.

""We analysed (the situation) and felt that we must have a bigger venue. Thus we shifted. First we thought of having it in Kangla though,"" Manipur BJP spokesperson RK Sivachandra told NDTV.

He said the venue for the rally - the only one that the PM would address before the first phase of polling on March 4 - would be a few kilometres away at Langjing Achouba ground, near CRPF Camp in Imphal. The PM is expected to address a second public meeting before the second phase of polling on March 8.

PRJA considers the change of venue a moral victory.

""We feel humbled to have done our part in protecting our sacred Kangla from political profanity,"" said PRJA's convener Erendro Leichombam.

Irom Sharmila, who hadn't eaten a morsel for 16 years to demand scrapping the Armed Forces Special Powers Act that gives security personnel sweeping emergency powers, founded the party last year after she ended her hunger strike."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Congress Veteran Sheila Dikshit Clarifies On 'Immature' Rahul Gandhi Remarks","http://www.ndtv.com/elections-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-congress-veteran-sheila-dixit-clarifies-on-immature-rahul-gandhi-remark-1663390","New Delhi:                             Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit has taken an U-turn on her earlier remarks on Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, asserting that he has ""the sensitivity of a mature leader"". The explanation came as a riposte to BJP President Amit Shah's barbs questioning her assessment of Mr Gandhi as ""still not mature and needs some time,"" and this despite handing him over the charge of a complex state like Uttar Pradesh.

""Please remember Rahul is still not mature, his age does not allow him to be mature. He is what... in his forties. Please give him time,"" Ms Dikshit had said in an interview to The Times of India on Thursday.

Her comments were quickly lapped up by BJP President Amit Shah, who did not waste any time to ridicule Mr Gandhi saying, ""immature Rahul should be kept at home"" instead of being sent to Uttar Pradesh.

With ""Don't twist my words"" hashtag, Ms Dikshit took to the Twitter on Friday to clarify her comments.

""Rahul has the sensitivity and concern of a mature leader. His words are those of a young, courageous and restless man,"" she stressed.

BJP president had taken a jibe at Congress at his election rally in Azamgarh on Friday saying, ""If he (Mr Gandhi) is not mature enough, why has he been imposed upon Uttar Pradesh? Is this a political laboratory or learning ground for someone?"" Mr Shah stressed that UP's problems require ""men of steel"" to solve them.

""The problems of Uttar Pradesh can be solved only under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" Mr Shah had said with confidence.  

A ""BJP tsunami"" will help his party get two-thirds majority in the 403-member Assembly and put an end to what he called the ""misrule"" of the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party, who have ruled the state by turns for the past 14 years.

The 78-year-old former Delhi Chief Minister was named by the Congress as the party's presumptive Chief Minister for UP, but that arrangement ceased after the party joined hands with the Samajwadi Party, with Akhilesh Yadav as their nominee for the top post."

Last year, the party snatched Assam from the Congress, which had ruled the state for 15 years.

In Manipur, the Congress has been in power for the exact same period. But the similarity ends there. While in Assam, the BJP united all possible allies to boost its prospects, in Manipur, everyone is singing ""Ekla Chalo Re (Go it alone)"".

The BJP's ally NPP, or the National People's Party of former Speaker Purno Sangma, is contesting 21 of the state's 60 seats. In many, it will hurt the BJP. ""We are a part of the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) but in every state, regional parties have their own aspirations and ideas,"" said Vivek Raj Wangkhem, the chief of the party.

While the Naga Peoples' Front (NPF) is also the BJP's friend at the Centre and in Nagaland, it is not in Manipur. The front is contesting 15 seats and in more than seven, it is a straight contest with the BJP.

""In Manipur, BJP and NPF have a lot of difference in ideology,"" said Hinreikhui Kashung, General Secretary of NPF.

To appease the Naga party, the BJP cannot afford to offend the majority Meitei community in Manipur.

""The NPF in its constitution has a paragraph where it states that it promotes the idea that contiguous Naga-inhabited areas in the northeast should be integrated into one administration. This is totally not acceptable to Manipuri people, so partnering with the NPF is not possible here,"" N Biren Singh, senior BJP spokesperson in Manipur told NDTV.

The Congress suspects that the BJP and its allies NPP and NPF have an understanding in the 20 seats in Manipur's hills, where it is weak.

""NPF is a constituent of NDA, they already have an understanding with the BJP and both the parties are hand-in-gloves,"" said G Gaikhamgam, Deputy Chief Minister, Manipur.

BJP has a friendly rival in seats in the plains too. Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party is fighting in 11 seats where the BJP's prospects looked good."

The incident happened around 4 pm, when Mr Tiwari was heading to Pratapgarh to address an election meeting in favour of BJP-Apna Dal candidate Sangam Lal Gupta, and had to land about few kilometres before the designated landing site.

""The helicopter developed some technical problem and its fuel was leaking. As it was reaching near the landing site in Snadwa Chandika (Pratapgarh) around 4 PM, the pilot had to make an emergency landing,"" Mr Tiwari told PTI over phone.

The pilot managed to successfully land the helicopter and everyone is safe, he added.

Delhi BJP media incharge Praveen Shankar Kapoor also said that the helicopter, in which Mr Tiwari was flying with his team, had to force land in Pratapgarh after technical problem, and they are safe.

Mr Tiwari addressed the election meeting and later headed to Varansi by road.

The helicopter, used by Mr Tiwari was hired by BJP for campaigning in the UP elections, was standing there.

The Delhi BJP president has been actively engaged in the party's campaigns in poll-bound states. He had addressed two election meetings each in Allahabad and Pratapgarh on Tuesday.

"It's Official. Manohar Parrikar Will Be Back As Goa Chief Minister Tomorrow","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manohar-parrikar-likely-to-take-oath-as-goa-chief-minister-tomorrow-1669043","Panaji: HighlightsManohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa chief minister for the fourth time
He was inducted into the Union Cabinet as defence minister in 2014
BJP staked claim to form government with the support of regional allies
                                Manohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa Chief Minister for the fourth time tomorrow. He declared today that he has resigned from PM Narendra Modi's council of ministers to go back to Goa as its Chief Minister. The incumbent BJP with 13 seats claims to have support of eight other legislators needed to cross the magic mark. Mr Parrikar will have to prove his majority in the assembly within 15 days of swearing in. He will also have to get elected to the state legislature within six months.

For most of the 28 months that he has been the country's Defence Minister, Mr Parrikar has often been called Goa's super chief minister, a reflection of the IIT-Bombay graduate's keen interest in the politics of the state.

Mr Parrikar, 61, had been Chief Minister for a little over two years in his third stint in that post, when he was pulled out of Goa in late 2014 to join PM Modi's cabinet.

Mr Parrikar together with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari held a long meeting on Sunday evening where the BJP efficiently collected the additional seven seats it needs from regional parties. Mr Parrikar then met with Governor Mridula Sinha to stake claim and was invited to form the government.

The BJP staked claim to form government despite placing second to the Congress which has won the most -17- but not enough to form the government - the target is 21.

The BJP legislators in Goa met on Sunday morning and unanimously said they want Mr Parrikar to head their government. The party's former ally the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP with three seats offered their support to the BJP on condition that Mr Parrikar will head the government.

Another regional party Goa Forward, which also won three seats, has provided its support in writing at the meeting on Sunday evening.

There are three independents who have been elected two of whom have promised support to the BJP, earning it the eight extra seats it needs for a majority.

The Congress has accused the BJP of ""murdering the democracy"".  

""Mr Parrikar did not even contest election...no one knows if he is popular among the people of Goa... this is murder of democracy in broad day light,"" said Congress' Priyanka Chaturvedi .

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, in a tweet, said, the ""BJP is stealing elections in Goa, Manipur. Party that comes second has no right to form government,"" he tweeted this morning.

Rejecting the Congress' claim, the BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao said, ""We secured 4 % more popular votes than the Congress, we also have legislative majority to form government."""

In the 2012 elections, a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Election Watch says, 45 candidates with criminal cases against them had won. 

However, money power continues to rule the roost as 80 per cent of the new MLAs are multi-millionaires, the report says.

The richest legislator, as per affidavits submitted to the Election Commission, is Shah Alam of BSP from Mubarakpur. He asserts amount to Rs. 117 crore.

Political observers see the decline in the number of winners from among those wielding muscle power as a ""good sign for politics and democracy"". 

Veteran journalist Rajiv Ranjan Jha says the decline in the number of MLAs with a criminal track record was certainly a ""heartwarming feeling"".

""For the last two decades, criminals have ruled the roost in the corridors of power. There have been efforts to minimise it, but such measures have so far failed,"" he added. 

He said there seems to be some churning among the voters against such candidates. 

The list of multi-millionaires includes Shah Alam (Bahujan Samaj Party), Rani Pakshalika Singh (Bharatiya Janata Party), Vinay Shankar (BSP), Gopal Nandi (BJP), Ajay Pratap Singh (BJP), Subhash Past (Samajwadi Party), Sahendra Singh (Rashtriya Lok Dal) and Om Kumar (BJP).

Of these, most have assets valued at over Rs. 25 crore."
"How BJP's UP Win Will Impact Presidential Election. Numbers Explained","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/how-bjps-up-win-will-impact-presidential-election-numbers-explained-1669025","New Delhi: HighlightsPresidential Election is due in July this year
President is elected by Electoral College - formed by 776 MPs, 4120 MLAs
BJP's huge win in UP will also improve the party's tally in Rajya Sabha
                                The BJP's electoral tsunami in Uttar Pradesh will not just dramatically change the party's numbers in the assembly but will have an immediate impact on the next Presidential elections in July when President Pranab Mukherjee completes his term.

For National Democratic Alliance or NDA the path to having its nominee elected as the next President has become much easier after the BJP and its allies won 325 lawmakers in UP, 57 in Uttarakhand and impressive 21 in Manipur. Since the results, the BJP has announced it is all set take charge in the state, claiming it has support of 31 legislators.

The President of India is elected by an electoral college that's formed by 776 parliamentarians and 4,120 legislators. The total strength of the electoral college is 10,98,882 votes and the halfway mark is 5,49,442 votes.

The NDA is now short of only about 25,000 votes and friendly parties like the Biju Janata Dal, AIADMK can easily bridge the deficit. But hours after its landslide, party president Amit Shah played down the numbers edge in the run up to the Presidential polls.

""The Electoral College is there and it will do its job,"" Mr Shah told reporters.

Next year, these results will also change the dynamics in the Rajya Sabha where the NDA government is in minority. In August 2018, 10 Rajya Sabha members of UP including BSP chief Mayawati will retire.

Of these 10 vacancies, majority will go to the BJP. The Bahujan Samaj Party, with just 19 lawmakers in a house of 403, will struggle to get Mayawati re-elected to the Rajya Sabha.

Overall 58 members will retire next August and the BJP is expected to get at least half of these seats.

But the numbers don't seem to deter the Congress. ""Yes, these numbers will give them the confidence but election arithmetic is different from raising people's issue,"" said PC Chacko, senior member of the party who's now overseeing the party's preparation for civic polls in Delhi next month.

Mr Chacko says it is their pressure that ""forced the Modi government to go back on the Land Acquisition Bill or more recently the issue of making Aadhar mandatory to avail benefits of the Midday meal scheme.""

""We will continue to oppose the Government where it is necessary,"" Mr Chacko said."

The party will hit the ground running. It has planned a week-long outreach programme to mark Dalit icon Bhim Rao Ambedkar's birth anniversary on April 14. The celebrations, which will start on April 6, the BJPs' foundation day, will be held in every panchayat ward in the country in an attempt to reach out to the Dalit community.

PM Modi has also asked party leaders to give a boost during that week to digital payment platform BHIM - short for Bharat Interface for Money which he dedicated to Ambedkar - by educating the masses about it, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar told reporters.

The laddoos, enough for all, celebrated the BJP's spectacular performance in assembly elections this weekend. The party has swept crucial Uttar Pradesh and also Uttarkhand and has managed to install governments it leads in Goa and Manipur. At today's meeting of party MPs, the architects of the wins, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah were felicitated. The BJP has pegged the election results as a victory of PM Modi's leadership and the people's verdict on his ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes in November, aimed at eliminating tax evasion.    

Home Minister Rajnath Singh proposed a resolution to thank voters of the states where elections were held and the BJP's workers for their success. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley supported the resolution that was passed unanimously,  Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said."

""Party that comes second has no right to form government,"" he tweeted this morning.

The response comes a day after the BJP announced that it is all set to form government in Goa and Manipur, claiming it has support of majority legislators.

Manohar Parrikar, who will take oath as Goa Chief Minister tomorrow evening, met with Governor Mridula Sinha on Sunday and was invited to form the government. Mr Parrikar today said that he has resigned as union Defence Minister.

Goa has 40 seats of which the Congress won 17, falling short of the magic number 21. The BJP, which is the incumbent, won 13. Many regional parties have extended their support to the BJP in Goa on a condition - Mr Parrikar will lead the government.

In Manipur, the BJP claims to have support of 31 legislators after scoring 21 seats in 60 seats assembly. Congress got the maximum seats - 27.

""We have letters of 30 MLAs and the 31st will send a letter to the Governor,"" said Himanta Biswa Sarma, who had joined the BJP from the Congress.

Mr Chidambaram comment comes a day after he acknowledged PM Narendra Modi as ""the most dominant political leader"" in the country.

But women haven't done as well when it comes to holding elected offices.

Only five women have been elected to the state assembly in the just-concluded elections; 62 of the over 630 candidates in the fray this year were women. The outgoing assembly too had only five women lawmakers.

Between the Congress and the BJP, the two big parties fielded just 12 candidates including eight from the Congress. Three won from the BJP, and two from the Congress.

BJP leader Sushila Baluni, also a prominent name in movement for a separate state, said she congratulated the women who made it. ""But this is not the Uttarakhand that I and countless other daughters of the hills had struggled for,"" she said.

The former chairperson of the state's women panel said ""recognising the importance of women's role in politics is the beginning of recognising their role in democracy.""

Among the three women who made it from the BJP is a politician who joined from the Congress, Rekha Arya and the daughter of a former chief minister, Ritu Khanduri Bhushan. The third was Meena Gangola from Gangolighat who won with a little over eight hundred votes.

From the Congress, the two successful lawmakers include Mamta Rakesh who took the plunge in electoral politics from Bhagwanpur seat after her husband's death in 2015. She defeated her brother-in-law Subodh Rakesh by over two thousand votes, retaining the seat she had first won in a by poll.

Three-time legislator Indira Hridayesh, also made it. She was a senior minister in the Harish Rawat government who defeated the BJP's Jogendra Rautela, who is the Haldwani Mayor."

Digvijaya Singh, the Congress leader in-charge of Goa described it as a ""great victory,"" though he did not explain his comments. The party's lawyer and senior leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it was important that the court heard the Congress petition ""patiently on a holiday"" and that ""the Governor's decision has been interfered with.""

""If someone wants to be Chief Minister for two days, he is welcome,"" Mr Singhvi said about BJP leader Manohar Parrikar, who has got a go-ahead from the top court to take oath as Goa Chief Minister this evening.

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi alleged that the BJP has used ""money power"" to annex power in Goa. He accused the party of ""misusing the governor's post.""

The Congress had moved the top court against Goa Governor Mridula Sinha inviting the BJP to form government in the state despite the Congress winning more seats in the assembly elections. The court did not accept the Congress' plea to stop Mr Parrikar from taking oath this evening and said he must prove that he has majority support on Thursday. The Congress has won 17 seats, the BJP has won 13 but moved fast to secure the support of smaller parties. A party must have the support of 21 MLAs in the 40-member assembly to form government.

The Congress says it too has 21 and should have been consulted by the Governor as the largest party before she invited the BJP.    

""If you had the numbers, you would have held a dharna (protest) at the Governor's house,"" the Supreme Court said today, adding that the Congress' petition to the court or the Governor does not provide proof of the majority support that it claims it has. The BJP has given the governor letters of support from its new allies.

Governor Sinha had given Mr Parrikar 15 days to prove he has majority support. The court asked him to take the vote in two days. The BJP has said it would've taken a floor test immediately anyway.

""I am grateful the court heard us. I believe the Governor's decision has been interfered with,""  Mr Singhvi said."

The meeting was held after a victory celebration by the BJP, with PM Modi getting off his car and walking the last stretch to the BJP office amid a shower of flower petals and slogan-shouting by ecstatic supporters. He also addressed the people after reaching the party headquarters.

"Arvind Kejriwal Alleges EVM Tampering. Do Vipassana, Says Harsimrat Kaur","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-alleges-tampering-of-evms-in-punjab-assembly-elections-1669675","New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal said 20-25% of AAP votes transferred to Akali-BJP combine
EVMs banned by nations abroad as they can be tampered with, he said
Mr Kejriwal has called for use of ballot papers in Delhi municipal polls
                                Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today raised questions about the Electronic voting machines in the Punjab assembly polls, saying 20 per cent to 25 per cent of AAP votes were transferred to the Akali-BJP coalition which was in power in the state. The number of votes polled by his party were far less in some areas than the number of volunteers the party, he said, adding the results fly in the face of predictions by several exit polls and political experts.

Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, daughter in-law of Akali Dal Chief Parkash Singh Badal, was quick to hit back. ""He (Kejriwal) has lost his mental balance so he is saying things like this. He did not say anything when AAP had won 67 seats in Delhi... He should do vipassana,"" she told reporters.

In his first interaction with the media after the results of the assembly elections were declared, Mr Kejriwal said his party was expected to win the elections. ""What then, went wrong? There was no word of Congress coming to power... yet they swept the elections... really don't know how that happened,"" he said.

The Congress had won 77 of Punjab's 117 seats. All exit polls had predicted a hung house for Punjab - the poll of exit polls had suggested that Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party would be neck and neck with the Congress.

Electronic Voting Machines, Mr Kejriwal said, had been banned by some nations abroad because they can be tampered with. To conduct free and fair polls in India, they should be discontinued. ""Our Supreme Court had said in the past that it is possible to tamper with EVMs. I'm not saying this, the Supreme Court said this,"" he said.

Citing an example, Mr Kejriwal said, ""In (Punjab's) Shri Govindpur we got 1 vote... there are 5 volunteers who swear they voted for us... similar instances across the state... where did all the votes go? There is something seriously wrong.""

Mr Kejriwal demanded that the votes registered in the EVMs be compared with the VVPAT trail (voter-verified paper audit trail) in nearly 32 places in Punjab. ""It is about the credibility of the Election Commission and the faith of people in the electoral system. We have strong prima facie evidence of foul play,"" he said.

After the BJP's sweeping victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections and the dismal performance of her own party, Mayawati had called for a switch to ballot papers, alleging that EVMs or Electronic Voting Machines, make rigging easy.

Mr Kejriwal has called for the use of ballot papers in the coming municipal elections in Delhi - a request that has been turned down by the Election Commission, which said such a change requires more time than it at hand. The civic elections are due on April 22."
"Trust Deficit With Youth Cost Congress Uttarakhand, Concedes Harish Rawat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/trust-deficit-with-youth-cost-congress-uttarakhand-concedes-harish-rawat-1669582","Dehardun:                             Outgoing Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat who led the Congress to its disastrous performance in the assembly polls has conceded that his inability to bridge the trust-deficit of the youth towards the party had contributed to its dismal performance.

The youth make up for over half of Uttarakhand's 75 lakh voters, half of them in the 19-29 age group.

Mr Rawat said somewhere, a major trust-deficit existed on the part of the youth towards him and his party.

""The whole of Uttarakhand wanted change and youngsters are included in that. Still, I would like to tell youngsters that we will continue to fulfil our major poll promises, but now while sitting in opposition,"" the chief minister told NDTV.

In the run-up to the elections, Mr Rawat had promised the youth free smart phones, jobs to 20 lakh and control distress-migration of youth from the state by 2022.

But how did the youth of Uttarakhand respond?

""There's a difference between claims and evidence. Change is necessary, for after all, development only happens when a new government comes to power,"" said 22 year old Prateek, a student from Chakrata.

""I have voted for Modi in these elections. I don't know about leaders from Uttarakhand, but Modi has an image which resonates with the youngsters across the state. Only he can do something for the youth,"" said 21-year-old Aryaveer Kothiyal.

""The Congress was unable to do anything about this so we will have to give BJP a chance; let's see what happens in the next 5 years,"" said Tejas, 19, a first-time voter from Dehradun. A state-level athlete, Nitesh, 20, echoed him. ""I have given my first-time vote to Modi for he seems like a leader who will take us all forward,"" he added."
"Disquiet In Goa Congress Over Digvijaya Singh's 'Mismanagement'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/grumbles-in-goa-congress-over-digvijaya-singhs-mismanagement-1669169","Panaji: HighlightsDigvijaya Singh was the Congress' in-charge for the Goa election
Manohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa Chief Minister today
Congress has filed a plea at the Supreme Court to stop his oath ceremony
                                One day after Goa Governor Mridula Sinha invited the BJP to form the government, senior Congress leaders are coming under attack from some of its prominent lawmakers who are angry that their leaders weren't as quick as the BJP to negotiate support from smaller parties and stake claim despite its higher numbers.

The Congress had emerged as the single largest party with 17 legislators and reportedly had the support from an independent in the 40-seat assembly. It was just three short of the majority mark of 21. But it was the BJP - which had just 13 legislators - that ended up with the invite.

On Monday evening, the Congress knocked on the Supreme Court's doors in Delhi to stop Manohar Parrikar - who quit as Defence Minister earlier in the day - from taking oath on Tuesday evening. The petition has argued that the Governor should not have invited the BJP, but the Congress by virtue of the mandate to the party.

Back in Goa, state Congress leaders are not too sure if it is too late.

One of the more vocal critics of the party leadership was the Congress leader Vishwajit P Rane, the leader of opposition in the outgoing Goa assembly who many believed was in the running for the chief minister's job.
 Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has accused the BJP of buying votesOn their target was the Congress general secretary and the party's in-charge for Goa, Digvijaya Singh, who accused the BJP of buying support.

""Money power has won over people's power. I apologise to the people of Goa as we couldn't muster the support to form the government,"" Mr Singh tweeted. Former Union Minister P Chidambaram had also accused the BJP of stealing the elections.

Mr Rane felt Congress party leaders had to take the blame.

 ""I think there was total mismanagement by the leadership,"" Mr Rane told NDTV, asserting that the people had given the Congress mandate to form the government but lost the opportunity ""because of foolishness of our leaders"".

Mr Rane, who had stormed out of the Congress legislature meeting, hinted that the party shouldn't take him for granted. ""There is a lot of pressure on me by all my MLAs supporting me to act but I am only holding back because of my leader Mrs Sonia Gandhi,"" he said.

Is he thinking about quitting the party?

""A lot of thoughts are coming in my mind. Sometimes I just feel that I am in the wrong party,"" said Mr Rane, also the son of Goa's five-time Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane.

Some other legislators such as Jennifer Monserrate - who told journalists how the party leaders had let the opportunity to slip through its fingers - wished that its central leaders had worked as hard and efficiently as Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, the BJP's point person for the state.

It was Mr Gadkari who had overseen the BJP's legislature party meet that named Mr Parrikar as their leader after the BJP's former ally, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP, promised support of its three legislators on the condition that Mr Parrikar heads the government. Another regional party, Goa Forward, which also won three seats, also provided its support in writing on Sunday evening. Of the three Independents, two have also supported the BJP."
"PM Modi's Big Election Win Will Have 'Implications' On Sino-India Ties: Chinese Media","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modis-big-election-win-will-have-implications-on-sino-india-ties-chinese-media-1670190","Beijing:                             The BJP's landslide victory in state polls has ""implications"" for Sino-India ties as it could further embolden Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""hard-line attitude"" and pose difficulties for ""compromises"" in disagreements with countries like China, an opinion in China's official media said today. ""(Prime Minister) Modi recently led his Bharatiya Janata Party to a sweeping electoral victory in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most-populous state, as well as garnering vigorous support in several other major state elections,"" an op-ed in the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC)-run Global Times said.

In the first commentary by the Chinese state media after the poll results, the article said the results, ""not only increased Prime Minister Modi's chance to win in India's 2019 general elections, some even predict he is already set for a second term"".

""Since Beijing-New Delhi ties have recently entered a subtle and delicate phase, observers soon started to pay close attention to how the bilateral relationship will develop after (Prime Minister) Modi tightens his grip on power,"" it said.

Describing Narendra Modi as a ""man of action"" with a ""hard-line attitude"", the article said India's domestic and international polices have undergone change under him.

""(Prime Minister) Modi's hard-line attitude is embodied in both his domestic policies, such as the ban on high-value currency notes, and in his diplomatic logic,"" it said.

""In the international arena, he changed India's previous attitude of trying never to offend anyone and started to take a clear stance in controversies among other nations to maximise its own interests. He enhanced New Delhi's ties with China and Moscow and applied to be a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Yet he also upgraded defence collaboration with the US and Japan, articulated his support for the US rebalance to the Asia-Pacific strategy and Washington's stance on the South China Sea issue,"" it stated.

""If Modi wins the next election (2019), India's current firm and tough manner is bound to continue. It will be without question good news for the country's own development,"" it said.

""Nevertheless, it will likely mean more difficulties in making compromises in rows with other countries. Take the border disputes between Beijing and New Delhi. No silver lining has yet emerged and (Prime Minister) Modi demonstrated his firm stance over the issue by celebrating Diwali, India's biggest holiday, with soldiers at the Sino-India border,"" it said.

""But while seeming inflexible on the surface, hard-liners also have powerful strength in coming to an agreement with others once they make up their mind, given their executive ability and high efficiency,"" it said.

""That said, we can still be optimistic in resolving our divergences, including border disputes, with New Delhi during (Prime Minister) Modi's term as long as both sides are willing,"" it said.

""For China, it is also an opportunity to give more consideration over how to make breakthroughs in Beijing-New Delhi relations with a hard-line Indian government,"" the article claimed.

Last year, Sino-India ties hit multiple roadblocks after China blocked India's admission into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), as well as blocking a United Nations ban on terrorist Masood Azhar and over the construction of the 46-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

This year began on a positive note, with both sides holding an upgraded Strategic Dialogue covering almost all aspects of the relations which both sides termed as very positive."
"Uttarakhand Top Job Contenders: Heavyweights, Turncoats And The Dark Horse","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-top-job-contenders-heavyweights-turncoats-and-the-dark-horse-1669181","Dehradun: HighlightsBJP won the Uttarakhand assembly election by a landslide
The chief minister will be decided by the party's parliamentary board
Aspirants include Satpal Maharaj, Prakash Pant, TS Rawat, among others
                                Uttarakhand voters have spoken their mind, giving the BJP eight out of every ten assembly seats that went up for polls. Now it is the BJP leadership's turn, to pick one out of the state's long list of aspirants that includes turncoats, heavy-weights including former chief ministers and low-profile leaders - encouraged by the party's choices in Maharashtra and Haryana - hoping to be the proverbial dark horse.

In all, the party netted 56 out of 69 seats for which the results have been declared. The results in one seat will be announced after the re-poll in one polling booth on March 15. The BJP parliamentary board is expected to name the party's chief minister the next day.

Satpal Maharaj, a former Congressman who joined the BJP in 2014, after quitting the Congress on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections, is considered a key contender for the state's top post. Son of a spiritual master and a former Union Minister, he worked as a foot-soldier for two years before getting the ticket.

""Satpal Maharaj's contesting from the hill district of Pauri moves the political geography of Uttarakhand away from the plains to the hills. This may work in his favour,"" said a BJP leader.

The former Congress leader, however, has competition from Trivendra Singh Rawat, the BJP leader who also oversaw the party's affairs in Jharkhand earlier as the state in-charge. Rawat is believed to have the confidence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah and could have, in the words of a senior state BJP leader, ""be preferred by the party cadre over Satpal Maharaj"".

Prakash Pant, the Pithoragarh lawmaker who had PM Modi address an election rally in his constituency, is seen as another high-profile contender. The first speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly, Pant was also among the state leaders to rush to Delhi after counting ended.

And then, there are close to six candidates including four former CMs: Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Maj General BC Khanduri (retd), Ramesh Pokhriyal and Vijay Bahuguna who had joined the party from the Congress last year. There is speculation they might try to push their nominees if they don't make it.

A BJP leader Yatishwaranand, who defeated the Congress' Harish Rawat in his Haridwar Rural consistency, and Harak Singh Rawat, the former Congress leader who contested from Kotdwar seat, had also queued up. Some leaders suggested that party brass could also go for someone who had a toehold in state politics but yet wasn't deeply entrenched, someone like the party's national spokesperson who hails from Uttarakhand, Anil Baluni."
"Congress Asks Why Is BJP Invited To Form Government In Goa","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congress-asks-why-is-bjp-invited-to-form-government-in-goa-1669004","New Delhi:                             The Congress has objected to the BJP being invited to take charge of Goa. In a letter to the Governor, the Congress said despite emerging as the single-largest party after assembly elections results were declared on Saturday, the governor had invited the BJP to form the government - a move ""not constitutionally permissible"". Preempting a similar announcement in Manipur, it has also sent a letter claiming first right to form the government.

""As per well-established constitutional convention and propriety, the single largest party is invited to form the government and prove its majority on the floor of the House. It has come to our notice that through media reports that BJP has been invited to form the Government and the oath is scheduled on 14th March 2017,"" Congress said in a letter to Goa Governor Mridula Sinha. The party has also sent a similar letter to the Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla, sources said.

Ms Sinha had invited the BJP to form the government after it staked claim, saying it had the support of eight additional legislators required over its 13 to form a majority in the 40-member assembly. Three legislators each of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP and Goa Forward party and two independents have lent support to the party. The Congress and its allies had won 18 seats.

The letter from the Governor's office said that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who maintained till late Sunday evening that he had not resigned, has been appointed Goa Chief Minister - one of the key conditions of the allies and an unanimous demand of the BJP's own legislators. He will have to prove his majority in the assembly within 15 days of taking charge.

But the Congress says that Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost both the constituencies he fought was a sign of the people's firm rejection of the BJP.

""Our political opponents (BJP) despite losing the mandate of the people have tried to misrepresent to your good-self that they enjoy the majority support of legislators. This is not only opportunism of the lowest kind but is also not constitutionally permissible,"" it said.

The party claimed it too had the required numbers to form government and were in ""a position to prove the same on the floor of the House""."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday expressed happiness to see a new record of highest number of women MLAs elected to the new Uttar Pradesh Assembly.

""Glad that a new record has been set of highest women MLAs elected in UP assembly. Congratulations to all women MLAs,"" Mr Modi tweeted while sharing an online news item.

The BJP won 312 of the 403 seats in the state assembly and, with 39.007 per cent of the vote, almost matched its record in Uttar Pradesh during 2014 general election, claiming the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades.

The mega UP election which was held in seven rounds establishes the success of PM Modi as a brand and his massive campaigning. The results also confirmed to PM Modi's demonetisation drive that was announced before the elections aiming at rooting out corruption and counterfeit currency. 

BJP leaves the final call to party chief Amit Shah, to decide on who will lead Uttar Pradesh as its Chief Minister. 

PM Modi responded to a media report stating that there will be a record of 38 women MLAs in attendance this term in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly, the highest since Independence.

He told AAP volunteers there was no reason for the party to give up.

In a break from his combative tone, where he has even questioned the reliability of the electronic voting machines (EVM), Mr Kejriwal urged volunteers to ""keep the faith"" alive. He will be interacting with the volunteers through Facebook Live on March 18, an AAP leader said.

""We will need time to fully understand the 'why and how' of these results. However, before thinking about what next, we need to understand that winning and losing will be part of our political adventure. The BJP has 18 seats and 20 per cent vote share in Karnataka and the Congress 15 seats and 18 per cent vote share in Maharashtra. They have not given up and there is no reason for us to give up,"" Mr Kejriwal wrote in a letter sent to all registered volunteers.

The letter, however, skips the issue of alleged rigging of voting machines in Punjab as raked up by the AAP chief yesterday. ""Although we did not get the expected results, we are now the opposition in Punjab. Also, we have got six per cent votes in Goa and we are just one state away from becoming a national party,"" he said.

Mr Kejriwal has alleged that EVM tampering may have led to the transfer of around 20-25 per cent of the AAP votes to the SAD-BJP combine. The Akalis got a drubbing in the Punjab polls, winning just 15 seats in the 117-strong assembly, while its ally BJP won three. The AAP finished a distant second behind the victor Congress, winning just 20 seats.

""You believed in us when we took our first baby step, had no experience in contesting elections, and did not know whether we could win even a single seat. Keep the faith, keep up the fight, Hum honge kamyaab,"" he said.

2017 UP election has proved that BJP's 2014 win wasn't an ""aberration""
However, BJP is unlikely to get a simple majority in 2019, said an expert
                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged as a clear favourite for the 2019 general elections after the BJP's landslide victory in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, top US experts on India have said. While one of the experts noted that the electoral results of the recently concluded Assembly polls in five states show that the 2014 Lok Sabha election results were not an aberration, another noted that Prime Minister Modi would continue to lead India after 2019.

The Assembly elections do not signal much of a change. The Uttar Pradesh election results showed that the 2014 general elections were not an ""aberration,"" Adam Ziegfeld, Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at the George Washington University said. ""It was a big win for the BJP. Its candidates won with a much larger margin of victory as compared to the two previous winners - BSP and Samajwadi Party,"" he said.

Prime Minister Modi has been established by this election as the ""clear and favourite winner"" for the 2019 general elections, Sadanand Dhume, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute said. ""PM Modi is the front runner (for 2019),"" he said.

However, Irfan Nooruddin, a professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service at the Georgetown University predicted that in 2019, the BJP is unlikely to be get a simple majority and that Prime Minister Modi would likely be heading a coalition government. BJP is running a disciplined election campaign state-by-state, while the Opposition fails, he said. ""The party does not do well in a state where it faces a direct opposition. BJP is beatable if the Opposition comes together,"" Mr Nooruddin said, adding that the party gains where it faces a fragmented opposition. He also said that by 2019, anti-incumbency would kick in.

""In this election, the BJP played the cast card while pretending to be above it,"" Sadanand Dhume, who was in Uttar Pradesh during the elections, said. ""Demonetisation was extremely popular. Indian people who have suffered themselves in the wake of the policy, it won their heart and mind. Here is this man of sincerity who struck a principled blow to corrupt and the rich,"" he said referring to his conversation with people in the state.

Mr Dhume, however, says that PM Modi after this historic victory in Uttar Pradesh is unlikely to go for the kind of economic reforms the private sector would like to have.

India is going to bump up its economic reforms that directly affects the people of the country, said Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. Picking up four governments in states all across India, and having future prospects, it is unlikely to have an impact on foreign policy. Like demonetisation #IamNewIndia is the pledge that the Prime Minister is asking citizens to be part of. This is his new India campaign.

BJP will now pick up a lot of seats in Rajya Sabha which would help the ruling party to carry out its long pending reform like the land acquisition reform and labor reforms. They would tart picking up seats as early as 2018. BJP is looking at 2019 and beyond."
"PM Narendra Modi Uses Victory Speech To Counter Criticism, Urge Humility","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardest-working-pm-they-say-this-will-continue-pm-narendra-modi-1668965","New Delhi: HighlightsPM thanked voters of the states whose results were declared yesterday
The victory celebration was attended by senior BJP leaders and ministers
PM Modi also attended a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board
                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi discarded his fortified SUV to walk a short distance to the BJP office in Delhi today which was surrounded by party workers waiting to celebrate him. As he moved past, flowers rained down on him as elite commandos in combat gear circled their VVIP.

The celebrations for the outsized results in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were turned by the BJP into a launchpad for future elections.

PM Modi thanked the voters of the five states whose results were declared yesterday and used his victory speech to counter criticism. The party has been rebuked by opponents and others for not fielding a single Muslim candidate in Uttar Pradesh. ""The BJP government is for those who have voted, (and) not voted for the party... no government has the right to discriminate. People are with or against some party only till the time of voting. Now, the UP government belongs to the people of UP,"" he said.

Top cabinet ministers, organisational leaders and Chief Ministers of different states were in attendance as Mr Modi was thanked for his leadership.

Political opponents charge his government with rising arrogance. The PM cautioned his party in a speech that was frequently interrupted by cheers of ""Modi, Modi"" that ""We have reached this position after hard work by four generations...winning requires us to be more humble. A tree may grow tall, but it can bend if it bears lots of fruit.""

To stress that outright landslide wins which have decimated the opposition will not result in over-confidence, the PM said, ""We may makes mistakes, but we will always be well-intentioned. We will work our hardest,"" he said (his punishing schedule is well-acknowledged), adding that, ""I am the first PM who is often asked about working so hard. We will always serve the people.""

If there was one over-riding theme to his speech, it was that there is a ""New India"" that is centered on its youth, and its aspirations, and its willingness to bear difficulties in the larger interest of progress, a reference to his demonetisation drive that was ridiculed by opponents but has been welcomed by the people.

It is now accepted even by rivals that his re-election is certain in 2019. The PM too suggested that he is drafting his agenda for a second term, highlighting that progress on key areas must be delivered ""by 2022 - when the country would be celebrating 75 years of independence.""

Pro-poor policies like free gas connections for the rural poor have served the BJP well in these elections, and the PM stressed, ""There is a need to raise aspirations among the poor to find opportunities to do better.""

In concert with this was his focus on development, which he described as ""a tough issue to highlight in a campaign...for 50 years, parties have been afraid to use this plank.""

His assertion that the BJP is going through a golden period has unquestionable evidence. The sea of BJP workers certainly agreed. They cheered him as he walked by. They danced in the street to patriotic songs. And each time they caught a glimpse of him on the plasma screens relaying his speech, they shouted his name."

Mr Shah asked him to rush to Goa, devise a strategy to turn things around
He refutes charges of horse-trading to form BJP-led government in Goa
                                As soon as the assembly elections results in Goa were announced in March -- in which the Congress emerged as the single largest party with 17 of the 40 seats in its kitty, but failed to immediately decide on who should be the chief minister -- the BJP, with four seats less than the rival got busy gathering support of smaller parties. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, the BJP leader in charge of Goa, met leaders of regional parties and independent legislators to convince them to help form and be part of a BJP-led government in the state.

 Mr Gadkari today revealed how the BJP turned its defeat into victory in Goa and managed the required numbers for forming the government and agreeing to make the then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar the chief minister. He added that while ""the Congress was sleeping, his party worked all night to form the government"".

However, he refuted charges of horse-trading during the hectic overnight parleys. ""I am not a person who does political deals. I am a 'mard' and do everything openly. I did not carry any money to anyone in Goa. I don't do such things. I fight and get things done,"" the senior BJP leader and Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister said at the India Today Editors Roundtable in Delhi.

The party had got 13 seats and Mr Gadkari informed BJP national president Amit Shah that the party had lost Goa and should concede defeat. However, Mr Shah asked him to devise a strategy to turn things around.

Soon after their meeting, Mr Gadkari packed his bags and started for Goa, he said.

Once in Goa, he met Sudin Dhavalikar of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) at the Taj hotel in Panaji who agreed to form an alliance with the BJP on the condition that he be given a ministerial berth. With the MGP's support, BJP's strength went to 16 and then he was approached by Vijay Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party (GFP).

""He had been a Congress man for his entire life. But he was being tortured by the Congress for past five years. We had got Dinesh Singh, a wrestler from Uttar Pradesh, and is a friend of Sardesai. He convinced Sardesai,"" Mr Gadkari said.

Mr Sardesai, along with a ministerial berth, wanted Manohar Parrikar to be made the chief minister.

Around 2.45 am he rang up Mr Shah about the demand. ""I had asked Parrikar, he said he would do whatever party asked (him) to do. But, my reading of his mind was that he was more than happy to return to Goa. I told the same to Amit Shah,"" he said.

What followed next needs no guessing.

Not Even On Twitter Or Facebook","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-high-court-mutes-evm-criticism-says-political-parties-individuals-cannot-criticise-evms-1707345","NEW DELHI:                             Coming to the defence of the Election Commission that has been the target of attacks from political parties over its voting machines, the Uttarakhand High Court on Friday barred political parties and others from criticising the use of these machines, or EVMs, in the five state assembly elections till pending election petitions are decided.

A systematic campaign has been unleashed against the EC, a constitutional body, a two-judge bench of the high court said. It ruled that the foundation of democracy would be weakened in case this tendency to damage constitutional bodies by levelling unsubstantiated allegations was not curbed. It added that the right of freedom of speech did not permit levelling unsubstantiated charges against the functionaries of the constitutional bodies.

""We, however, in the larger public interest, restrain"" all political parties, non-governmental organizations and individuals ""from criticising the use of EVMs in the recently conducted elections of the State Assemblies even by approaching the electronic media, press, radio, Facebook, Twitter etc. till the decision of the election petitions,"" the court said.

The verdict, which ends the no-holds barred attack launched by the Aam Aadmi Party, also puts a question mark on Arvind Kejriwal's plan to conduct a parallel hackathon on Saturday that taunted the election commission for its restrictive ground rules. Under these rules, AAP's Saurabh Bharadwaj said, even its look-alike EVM could not be tampered.

The court allowed the election commission to go ahead with the EVM Challenge that it was to hold on Saturday but frowned at the event nonetheless, observing that it ""may influence the outcome of election petitions wittingly or unwittingly"".

Only two parties, the Nationalist Congress Party and the CPI-M had applied to participate in tomorrow's EVM challenge conducted by the commission to put all concerns about the machine's reliability at rest. Representatives of the two political parties can, however, only fiddle with the buttons, and not open the machines."

The two-day meet, attended by state leaders and central representatives, is focussed on Mission 150 - the target of winning 150 out of 224 seats in Karnataka's Assembly elections scheduled for next year.

But the real interest from the media and political watchers was on another, unstated mission - the urgent need for the state BJP to get its act together and be united in the countdown to those polls.

The run-up to the meet had seen defiance of state party president and former chief minister, BS Yeddyurappa by KS Eshwarappa, a Kuruba leader. In December last year, Mr Eshwarappa launched the Sangolli Rayana Brigade, a Dalit and backward class organisation, against the wishes of Mr Yeddyurappa. Late last month, he and his followers held a meeting in Bengaluru - to 'save' the party from what they said was Mr Yeddyurappa's autocratic style of functioning. Mr Yeddyurappa protested.

The BJP high command took notice of the row and four office bearers - two from each side - were removed by state in-charge Muralidhara Rao.

There was speculation whether Mr Eshwarappa would even attend the Mysuru meet. But he did arrive, one of the last leaders to do so. He told NDTV as he entered, ""I do not wish to say anything none,"" in response to our questions on party unity. A meeting of the Sangolli Ratana Brigade, scheduled on Monday in Raichur has been postponed.

There were small problems that had been sorted out, Union Minister Ananth Kumar told NDTV. Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar said that he would only speak about party matters in the party forum - and that the meet was to focus on strategy for the election.

Karnataka was described by the BJP as its Gateway to the South - and Mr Yeddyurappa was its first chief minister in its first government in southern India in 2009. It earlier had an uneasy coalition with the Janata Dal Secular in the state which did not end well - but the party came back to form the government by itself.

Outwardly, the Mysuru meet is progressing peacefully. But the party clearly needs to deal with its unity before taking on the ruling Congress at the polls."
"Arvind Kejriwal's Hackathon Vs Election Commission's: What To Expect","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/14-vote-machines-evms-ready-for-hackathon-some-used-in-uttar-pradesh-1707064","New Delhi: HighlightsPolitical parties had alleged vote machines can be rigged
Election Commission's challenge accepted by 2 parties
AAP rejects Election Commission's event, will hold its own hackathon
                                The Election Commission has organised more than 10 vote machines that were recently used in elections in Uttar Pradesh for tomorrow's hackathon, where political parties will try to prove in Delhi that the machines can be rigged.

A total of 14 Electronic Voting Machines or EVMs will be made available to representatives of Sharad Pawar's party NCP and the Left who hope to prove that the Election Commission is wrong and that the equipment used by it can be gamed, as alleged by a series of political outfits including the Congress and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party or AAP after Prime Minister Narendra Modi front-lined his party's gigantic wins in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

AAP, which has accused the Election Commission of colluding with the BJP to rig results in its favour, has announced that it will hold a parallel hackathon of its own tomorrow. The machine it will make available to techies and others is the one that was used by the party in the Delhi Assembly last month in a televised demonstration of its manipulation. The Election Commission said the machine used was a far cry from the real thing and rejected the result.

At the Election Commission's event, hackers will get five hours - from 10 am to 2 pm - and access to four machines each. The other EVMs will be kept as back up. 

The Election Commission has said its challenge has two parts - the hackers will have to prove that the EVMs used in the five states that just voted including UP and Punjab were manipulated to favour a particular candidate or political party by altering the results stored in them.

In their effort, hackers will be permitted to use a combination of keys or buttons on the electronic machines, or over the air communication devices such as cellphones and Bluetooth to tamper with the machine to change the results.

Part Two of the challenge calls for participants to prove that the machines used in the assembly polls were manipulated before or on the day of voting. 

The participant will be considered ""failed"" if the EVM stops functioning as a result of its inbuilt defense mechanism against tampering.

The participants - three members per party - can ""physically examine"" EVMs and check circuits, chips and motherboard, but cannot replace any part. Arvind Kejriwal's party had asked for these restrictions to be removed, claiming it ""would not be possible to tamper with the machines without giving people a free hand to do so."""
"BS Yeddyurappa Will Be BJP's Chief Ministerial Face In Karnataka: Amit Shah","http://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/bs-yeddyurappa-will-be-bjps-chief-ministerial-face-in-karnataka-amit-shah-1704469","New Delhi:                             Former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa will be the BJP's chief ministerial face in the Assembly polls scheduled early next year, party president Amit Shah said on Friday.

During an interaction with the Press Trust of India, Mr Shah also indicated that Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani would be the party's choice for the top post in the state, asserting that it would win more than 150 seats in the Assembly polls slated later this year. The Assembly has 182 seats.

He, however, said the party has not yet decided on its chief ministerial face in Himachal Pradesh, which goes to polls along with Gujarat.

""It (Karnataka election) will be fought under Yeddyurappa,"" Mr Shah said.

Asked if it meant that Mr Yeddyurappa, who is the BJP's Karnataka unit chief, will be the chief ministerial face, he said, ""He will be.""

The Karnataka unit has been facing factional fight with a group headed by former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa targeting Mr Yeddyurappa's leadership.

To a question on the party's state of affairs in Karnataka, Mr Shah said he would visit the state soon. The party had recently taken action against some leaders, suspected to be behind the internal wrangling.

Asked whether Mr Rupani will be the party's CM face in Gujarat, Mr Shah said, ""He is already the chief minister.""

""What does it mean that he will be the chief ministerial face...,"" he said in a lighter vein.

Mr Yeddyurappa, 74, an influential Lingayat leader, had led the BJP to its maiden victory in the southern state in 2008, but was forced to resign following charges of corruption against him.

He floated his own outfit in 2011. Though his party performed poorly in the 2013 Assembly polls, it managed to wean away a substantial chunk of the BJP votes, leading to a rout of the BJP.

He returned to the BJP fold ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election."

""When people are throwing stones and petrol bombs at us, I cannot tell my men 'just wait and die',"" General Rawat was quoted as saying by news agency Press Trust Of India.

"In Politically Fragile Goa, Congress Takes Aim At Manohar Parrikar's MLA Election","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-politically-fragile-goa-congress-takes-aim-at-manohar-parrikars-mla-election-1693471","Panaji:                             A flurry of political activity in Goa, a state with 40 assembly seats, has triggered fresh reports of political uncertainty.

There are speculations, some even bordering on whether the Congress is attempting a ""coup"" on Manohar Parrikar who will have to contest an election to become a legislator in September to cement his position as the Chief Minister of the state.

After the sacking of the Congress in-charge of Goa, Digvijaya Singh, who was blamed for botching up the Congress's prospect of forming a government in the state, the new in-charge, A Chellakumar, is now trying to give Goa a fresh shot.

Sources say that Mr Chellakumar camped in Goa for five days and was in touch with some legislators to see how the party that has 15 MLAs and is five short of the government formation mark could be back in the saddle.

When asked about these reports of an attempted coup, Mr Chellakumar said ""Goa is a small state where everyone is in touch with everyone."" He also added that ""Goans voted against the BJP in 26 seats so it was a vote against Manohar Parrikar.""

Congress sources say that Mr Parrikar is worried about his prospects of a safe election from Panaji hence the BJP is giving wind to rumours of the Congress trying to orchestrate a coup.

There's also intense speculation that the three MLAs of current BJP-led coalition partner ""Goa Forward"" could abandon the BJP - a party it was ideologically opposed to before the elections. This forced ""Goa Forward's"" Vijay Sardesai to take to Facebook Live and clarify that there were no such plans. Trashing the reports, he told NDTV that he said ""We are getting the respect in the government. Our positions on issues are becoming policies and it is because of the Goa Forward that Manohar Parrikar is chief minister.""

The BJP's Goa General Secretary Sadanand Tanavde told NDTV that ""Manohar Parrikar is a strong leader and will easily win in the elections that are expected to take place in September. The Congress's A Chellakumar is making false claims that the party is in touch with some MLAs because he is struggling to keep his flock together.""

The Congress had won 17 of the state's 40 seats in the recently concluded assembly elections. But as the party bickered over who would be Chief Minister, the BJP, which won four seats less, stitched together a coalition with regional parties and Independent legislators. Because the potential allies wanted Manohar Parrikar - who till then was the Union Defence Minister - to lead the government, he was shifted back to Goa. The miffed Congress had cried foul, saying it should have been given change to form the government."
"From 2024 Hold Lok Sabha Elections, Assembly Polls Simultaneously: NITI Aayog","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/from-2024-hold-lok-sabha-elections-assembly-polls-simultaneously-niti-aayog-1687819","New Delhi:                             The NITI Aayog has suggested a synchronised two-phase Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024 so as to ensure minimum 'campaign-mode' disruption to governance. Outlining the details, the policy think-tank has said implementing the proposal may necessitate ""a maximum one-time curtailment or extension of some state assemblies"".

It has made the Election Commission the nodal agency to look into the suggestion and recommended setting up of a working group of stakeholders for deciding a road-map for synchronised elections.

A report in this regard need to be finalised within six months and final blue-print will be ready by next March, as per draft three-year action agenda for 2017-18 to 2019-20. The draft report was circulated among the Governing Council members (consisting of chief ministers of all states and others) of the NITI Aayog on April 23.

The recommendation assumes significance as President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pitched for simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls.

""All elections in India should happen in a free, fair and synchronised manner so as to cause minimum 'campaign-mode' disruption to governance. We may begin work towards switching to a synchronised two-phase election from the 2024 election to the Lok Sabha,"" the NITI Aayog draft report says.

This would require a maximum one-time curtailment or extension of some state assemblies, it said.

""To implement this in the national interest, a focused group of stakeholders comprising constitution and subject matter experts, think-tanks, government officials and representatives of various political parties should be formed to work out appropriate implementation-related details.

""This may include drafting appropriate Constitution and statutory amendments, agreeing on a workable framework to facilitate transition to simultaneous elections, developing a stakeholder communication plan and various operational details,"" the draft report says.

President Mukherjee in his speech on the eve of this year's Republic Day had favoured holding Lok Sabha and assembly elections together. ""The time is also ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after Independence when elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously. It is for the Election Commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties,"" President Mukherjee had said.

PM Modi had in February made a strong pitch for simultaneous elections. ""It (simultaneous polls) will cause some loss to all, including us,"" he had said, and asked political parties to not look at the idea through narrow the prism of politics.

""One party or a government cannot do it. We will have to find a way together,"" he had said.

Elections are being held all the time somewhere or else in the country and continuous elections lead to lot of expenditure, PM Modi had said replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.

The prime minister had said over Rs. 1,100 crore was spent in holding the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and the expenditure shot up to Rs. 4,000 crore in 2014.

He had said that over a crore government employees, including a lot of teachers, are involved in electoral process and the continuous exercise thus causes maximum harm to the education sector.

Security forces also have to be diverted for electoral works across the year even while enemy country keeps plotting against the nation and terrorism remains a strong threat, PM Modi had said."

A bench of Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justices DY Chandrachud and SK Kaul issued notice to the Centre, the CEC, the Gujarat government and the state election commission, and sought their response in four weeks. The top court posted the matter for hearing to the first week of July.

Petitioner Reshma Vithabhai Patel, the convener of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti, which was in the forefront of the Patel quota agitation, claimed that EVMs were not ""fully reliable, foolproof, tamper-proof or hacker-proof"". The plea was dismissed by the Gujarat High Court on April 12.

The Election Commission should be asked to replace EVMs with ballot paper, or to ensure Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) for every EVM, she had demanded.

The Assembly election in Gujarat is due later this year. The plea by Ms Patel had also alleged that the names of thousands of members of a ""particular community"" were missing from voter lists in the 2015 municipal corporation polls. It had sought the court's direction to the poll panel to prevent this in future.

She has said that the high court has erred in not appreciating that the Supreme Court had passed its judgement on October 18, 2013, asking ensuring polling through EVMs with paper trail but despite that it has not been implemented by the the ECI and the State Election Commission.

In her plea, it was contended that the high court has erred in not appreciating that there are allegations that at the behest of the ruling party, the names of voters were deleted from voter lists in the last six municipal corporations elections held in 2015."

It failed to form a government, despite being the largest party
Assembly elections in Congress-ruled Karnataka will be held next year
                                The Congress has removed its senior leader Digvijaya Singh as the party's in-charge in Goa and Karnataka. The decision comes nearly a month after the Congress failed to form a government in Goa despite emerging as the single largest party, commissioning biting criticism of Mr Singh from his colleagues and ridicule from opponents. He has been replaced in Goa by A Chellakumar and Lok Sabha member KC Venugopal in Karnataka.

""Congress president Sonia Gandhi has assigned the tasks of looking after Karnataka and Goa affairs to new AICC teams. While KC Venugopal has been made general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, A Chellakumar has been made AICC in-charge of Goa,"" party general secretary Janaradan Dwivedi said in a statement.

In elections held in February, the Congress managed to win 17 of the total 40 seats in Goa. However, as it took too long to make up its mind on post-poll alliances, the BJP quickly stitched up partnerships with regional parties and formed the government under former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.

In his farewell speech in the Rajya Sabha last month, Mr Parrikar took a jibe at Mr Singh and said, ""My special thanks to honourable member Digvijaya Singh, who happened to be in Goa but did nothing so that I could form the government.""

The Congress' inability to form the government in Goa also led to the resignation of Vishwajit Rane - who was seen as a possible Chief Ministerial candidate in Goa - from the party. Mr Rane, now a BJP member, openly criticised Mr Singh and accused him of ""mismanagement"".

The Congress has removed Mr Singh, a former two-time Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, as its in-charge in Karnataka, one of the few states currently held by the party. Assembly elections in the state will be held next year and the Congress would not want to relive it Goa experience."
"Meghalaya BJP Leader Quits Party Protesting Against Cattle Trade Rule","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/meghalaya-bjp-leader-resigns-from-party-in-protest-against-centres-cattle-trade-rule-1706678","New Delhi:                             As the Central government confronts strong opposition to its new rule banning cattle trade for slaughter in south and the northeast, a BJP leader in Meghalaya has resigned in protest. Bernard Marak, a leader from Garo hills, had recently caused a stir by promising cheaper beef to people if they voted the BJP to power.

Assembly polls are due early next year in the hill state, where beef is a staple.

""I have decided to quit the party because I am a Christian and Garo first,"" Mr Marak said today, adding, ""The BJP is hurting the sentiments here on the beef issue. Tribal society has its own laws. The BJP is trying to push Hindutva.""

Mr Marak's cheaper beef offer earlier this week discomfited the party as its government at the Centre faced criticism about its new cattle trade rules. The state BJP distanced itself from Mr Marak's comments, calling those his own views. Meghalaya BJP chief Shibun Lyndoh said the party ""is not against people having beef"".

""Total beef ban is something that even people here do not support,"" he said, adding what was required in the state were regulations and hygienic slaughter houses.

The BJP is yet to comment on the exit of the leader, who commands a chunk of the tribal votes.

""Bernard is right to the extent that there are people in the BJP in Meghalaya who eat beef... In Meghalaya it is not the BJP's agenda to put a beef ban,"" said senior BJP leader Nalin Kohli. But he denied that the party will push for cheaper beef if it comes to power. ""It is not the BJP's agenda to run markets that sale beef. That is for the market to decide. What Bernard says is his personal view not the party's view. ""

The new cattle trade rule of the Centre, that has triggered widespread protests in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, says cattle sold in animal markers cannot be used for slaughter. After Kerala and West Bengal, Tripura's Left government has said it will not implement the rule, describing it as ""anti-people""."

                                The two-day executive meet of the Karnataka BJP unit, that ends today in Mysuru, saw the party trying hard to present a united front and keep it together. Ahead of the meet, backward class leader KS Eshwarappa continued his open defiance against state party president, BS Yeddyurappa. Also, there was little interaction between the two during the meet that focused on Mission 150 - the target of winning 150 out of 224 seats in Karnataka's Assembly elections scheduled for next year.

But the party insists ""all is well'.  Senior party leader Katta Subramanya Naidu told NDTV, ""We are all one group, one family.""

State General Secretary and Mr Yeddyurappa loyalist, Shoba Karandlaje also said that the former chief minister and Mr Eshwarappa would work together. ""They are together now. All will be well in the near future,"" she said.

 As Mr Eshwarappa moved a motion on Sunday demanding a loan waiver for farmers, the lack of interaction between him and Mr Yeddyurappa was evident. However, Mr Eshwarappa's presence at the venue indicated that the central party leadership has brought him into line. He has also called off, at least for now, a meeting of Sangolli Rayana Brigade, a group of backward classes and Dalits that he launched in December against the wishes of Mr Yeddyurappa, scheduled for Monday in Raichur in north Karnataka. 

Last month, Mr Eshwarappa's side held a conclave in Bengaluru to 'save' the party from what they alleged was Mr Yeddyurappa's autocratic style of functioning. The BJP high command took notice of the row and four office bearers - two from each side - were removed by state in charge Muralidhara Rao.

The BJP understands that if it has to win Karnataka back in 2018, the ongoing infighting could prove costly. Which is why all the leaders are expected to drop their differences and move ahead as a unified squad."
"Shaking Up Elections, Corporate Tax: What India's 3-Year Plan Looks Like","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/shaking-up-elections-corporate-tax-what-indias-3-year-plan-looks-like-1687915","New Delhi: HighlightsNITI Aayog proposes 3-year agenda after PM meets Chief Ministers
Suggests simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024
Corporate tax holiday for job creators, farm tax reform also suggested
                                Any talk of taxing farm incomes turned out to be a political hot potato but NITI Aayog's three-year action agenda - discussed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Ministers last week - has set out several ambitious goals.

One of the most far reaching suggestions by NITI Aayog is to hold simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024. The report says, ""There should be synchronized two-phase elections even if that means curtailing or extending the tenure of some assemblies in national interest.""

The action plan says that the Election Commission should form working groups of stakeholders and submit a report by March 2018.

On curbing black money, the action plan says tax rates should be moderate and transparent. Real sector should be reformed and Aadhaar should be linked to real estate transactions, it says.

The most interesting part is with regard to taxes on agricultural incomes. On Wednesday, NITI Aayog had claimed that member Bibek Debroy's suggestion - that ultimately the rural sector including agriculture should be taxed - was his personal view.

But the final report said: ""All agricultural income is currently exempt from income tax regardless of its size. While the provision is meant to protect farmers, non-agricultural entities sometimes use it to evade taxes by declaring agriculture as the source of their income. In order to mitigate the generation of black money, the loopholes need to be plugged.""

Another ambitious project is to create well-paid jobs. Comparing India with China's job growth, the report says, ""Many super competitive firms in China today employ not just tens of thousands of workers but hundreds of thousands of them. In contrast, there are hardly any firms in India employing hundreds of thousands of workers.""

NITI's action plan says companies that create 10,000 jobs within three years of setting up should be given a corporate tax holidays for five years. It has also suggested zero per cent GST for six years to companies that employ 20,000 workers.

Other suggestions include setting up coastal employment zone and faster labour reforms.

At Confederation of Indian Industry's annual session on Friday, the head of NITI was blunt about the private sector's track record of creating jobs.

""Why I do not see a single industrialist putting up a factory of 250,000 workers doing apparel?"" asked Dr Arvind Panagariya.

At the moment, NITI Aayog's draft report has been circulated among state governments for their will give their feedback and suggestions before the policy think tank finalises India's growth roadmap."

                                Delhi's mandate for his party in the civic elections last week is the nation's mandate, BJP chief Amit Shah said on Tuesday, saying the massive win is another stamp of approval for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's work at the Centre. Mr Shah also wrote off the Aam Aadmi Party, which came a feeble second, mocking Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for blaming his party's drubbing on electronic voting machines or EVMs.

Delhi was won for the BJP by its booth-level workers, Mr Shah said at a celebration of his party's win with party workers and new corporators in the capital. The BJP has won 181 of 272 seats in three corporations. AAP could win only 48.

""Kejriwal-ji might blame EVMs for our victory, but to know the real reason, meet our booth in-charge,"" said Mr Shah, whose winning strategy in Delhi included sacking most sitting corporators to beat any anti-incumbency sentiment after 10 years of the BJP dominating the Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD.    
 Amit Shah said that the BJP's victory was the ""foundation"" for the next assembly elections in DelhiThe Aam Aadmi Party had, in allegations now toned down, said after the MCD election results that rigged EVMs aided the BJP's re-election to Delhi's three corporations.   

Mr Kejriwal has since embarked on an organisational shake-up and outreach at the grassroots to rebuild his party, which is reeling from multiple election defeats. Earlier this year, it failed make a dent in Punjab, where Mr Kejriwal had expected to establish a second AAP government after Delhi. In Goa, the party could not win a single seat.

Just two years ago, Mr Kejriwal's party had shocked the BJP winning 67 of Delhi's 70 seats. The BJP could win only three. The Delhi assembly elections had put the brakes on the BJP's winning since its victory in the 2014 national elections, and the party, still smarting from the huge defeat, had launched a campaign to win the civic polls on the scale of a state election.

Mr Shah said today that the BJP's victory was the ""foundation"" for the next assembly elections in Delhi. ""The mandate of the national capital is the nation's mandate. It establishes once again that the people of India are firmly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" he added."

Talking to Press Trust of India, All India Congress Committee secretary Girish Chodankar today said, ""We will be fielding a candidate, who will be acceptable to all the parties. When I say that I mean all the non-BJP parties.""

Goa has the lone Rajya Sabha seat, which is currently represented by Congress leader Shantaram Naik. The election to the RS seat would be held on June 8.

When contacted, BJP Goa general secretary Sadanand Tanawade said his party was yet to decide the candidate, but it would be a choice of all the parties, which support the Parrikar-led government.

""We will meet tomorrow to finalise the name of the candidate for the RS polls,"" Mr Tanawade said.

""Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar will take a call on this. The candidate that BJP will field will have support of all the coalition partners,"" Mr Tanawade said.

Goa Forward Party's mentor Vijai Sardesai was unavailable for comment, but a senior party functionary said that they were yet to take decision on the RS poll.

The party has said that food ran out while Mr Yeddyurappa and his team were at the home of Madhu Kumar in Chitradurga district for breakfast, and so more was bought from outside.

A man called D Venkatesh has filed a police complaint against Mr Yeddurappa, accusing him of casteism. 

""Yeddyurappa and party workers had gone to a Dalit house. There, food was cooked and served. As food ran out, some food was obtained from outside. We cannot say what items were prepared and who ate what, but the best proof is from the family itself which says they served Yeddyurappa the food they cooked and that it was a happy occasion,"" said BJP's Suresh Kumar.

On a video circulated by the BJP, Madhu Kumar, a member of the family that Mr Yedduruappa visited, said, ""We were very happy to hear that the former chief minister was coming to our house. He came on Friday, May 19, at 8.30am. We served him breakfast that we had cooked at home. He ate the breakfast. But because more people had come we had to get food from outside too.""

D Venkatesh has filed a police complaint against Mr Yeddurappa in a different district, Mandya. He has no known political links, but the BJP said it spots an attempt by the ruling Congress to discredit Mr Yeddyurappa, who is on a tour of the state, his party said, to learn about the problems of the people in a drought year. Karnataka votes for a new government next year and the BJP hopes to snatch the state back from the Congress. 

""The Congress cannot take my going to Dalits' homes and eating with them and asking about their difficulties, trying to help them. So they are trying to give it a different colour. I went again today to a Dalit colony. I went to a slum and spoke with them about their difficulties,"" Mr Yeddyurappa, 74, said in Bagalkote.

Reacting to Mr Yeddyurappa, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said, ""He has been in politics for 40 years. Didn't he remember the Dalits before this? To go there, order hotel food and eat it? What affection is there for the Dalits."""
"Arvind Kejriwal Begins AAP Reconstruction, Bigger Role Likely For Kumar Vishwas","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-begins-aap-reconstruction-bigger-role-likely-for-kumar-vishwas-1688446","New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal pacifies Kumar Vishwas by removing MLA from key post
Mr Kejriwal to meet all 64 AAP legislators one on one, get feedback
Changes in AAP's national team expected, Mr Vishwas to get bigger role
                                A week after he was dealt a deadly blow in the Delhi civic elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has begun reconstructive surgery of his Aam Aadmi Party, starting with an outreach to the over 60 legislators who had won the party a massive mandate in assembly elections in the national capital just two years ago. Up ahead, said sources, are major changes in the party's leadership structure that could see leaders like AAP's founder member Kumar Vishwas play a greater role.

Mr Kejriwal pacified an upset Mr Vishwas yesterday by removing from a key party post Amanatullah Khan, a Delhi legislator who had accused him of attempting to replace the party chief. Many AAP lawmakers from both Delhi and Punjab had backed Mr Vishwas against what they saw as an attempt to scuttle his chances at being elevated in the party; he is currently only responsible for overseas funding.

From today, Mr Kejriwal will meet each of his 64 Delhi legislators one on one and will gather feedback on the party's work at the ground level. He will also meet AAP's volunteers, seen as the young party's backbone in its dream surge to prominence, but who seem to have lost steam after successive defeats this year - first in the Punjab and Goa assembly elections and then the drubbing the Delhi civic polls.

Mr Kejriwal has been accused of losing touch with the grassroots in recent days as his ambitions to expand AAP nationally have grown and sources close to him said he is keen to refurbish his image of a transparent and accessible leader. They also said that he is being extremely cautious in determining new roles for leaders in AAP.

Kumar Vishwas had on Saturday rued that the AAP chief is now surrounded by ""yes men"" who misguided him into blaming what he alleged were rigged electronic voting machines or EVMs for his party's loss to the BJP in Delhi.

A meeting called by Mr Kejriwal of top AAP leaders later assessed that the election drubbing in fact indicates an urgent need for organisational restructuring. Top leaders like Sanjay Singh, Dilip Pandey and Durgesh Pathak resigned last week from key party posts owning responsibility for the Delhi defeat and Mr Kejriwal will first appoint a new Delhi AAP team. He has already named Delhi minister Gopal Rai to head it in Dilip Pandey's place.

Changes in the national team are expected next, said sources, and that is when Mr Vishwas is expected to be given a bigger role by Mr Kejriwal, though it is not known yet what that role will be."
"Its Siddaramaiah vs BJP's Yeddyurappa In Karnataka Assembly Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/karnataka-news/in-karnataka-assembly-elections-2018-congress-pitches-chief-minister-siddaramaiah-against-bjps-bs-ye-1706424","Bengaluru:                             The Congress today named Karnataka Chief Minister K Siddaramaiah as the party's face in the coming Assembly polls, pitching him against former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, who will be leading the campaign for the BJP. Mr Yeddyurappa was named the party's choice for the Chief Minister's post by BJP chief Amit Shah in August.

Assembly elections in the state are due next year, in which the Congress is trying to stay in power for the second consecutive term.

The Congress today announced some restructuring within the party. The changes come after party vice president Rahul Gandhi's strategy meet with the key state leaders.

State Home Minister G Parameshwara will step down from the cabinet and devote himself to his duties as chief of the party's state unit, the party has said. A statement from party's national general secretary Janardan Dwivedi also announced the elevation of SR Patil, Dinesh Gundurao, minister DK Shivakumar, former Union minister K H Muniyappa and Satish Jarkiholi in various party posts.

The appointments have been made keeping in mind all sections and castes of the state. While Siddaramaiah is a key leader from the Kuruba Gowda community, Mr Parameshwara and Mr Muniyappa are Dalit leaders. The dominant Lingayat and community is represented by Mr Patil, the Vokkaligas by Mr Shivakumar. Mr Jarkiholi has a huge following among tribals.

The BJP, which recently saw a revolt against Mr Yeddyurappa by backward class leader KS Easwarappa, is trying to keep a united front.  Amit Shah has spelt out the party's target -- Mission 150 -- 150 seats in the 224-member state assembly. The party, which has been hoping for big gains, recently acquired Congress veteran SM Krishna, a former Chief Minister and a powerhouse in the state."
"No Credible Proof On EVM Tampering, Says Election Commission: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/election-commissions-live-demo-to-prove-vote-machines-cant-be-tampered-with-highlights-1696048","New Delhi:                             The Election Commission (EC) set the date for the challenge to show that voting machines or EVMs can be tampered with. The challenge begins from June 3. Last Friday, the top election body had held an all-party meet to discuss the upcoming 'EVM hackathon' after allegations that the voting machines were hacked in the recently-held assembly elections and the Delhi civic elections. Today, before a press conference, the Election Commission displayed the working of both an electronic voting machine or EVM and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail or VVPAT.

Here are the highlights of the press conference by Chief Election Commissioner Dr. Nasim Zaidi:The Commission has conducted elections successfully for 107 state assembliesSome people have doubts about about the EVMs. We have even got suggestions. But the EC has not received any credible information about these.We held an 8-hour meeting with political parties. The Commission has stated before parties that all future elections will be mandatory held with VVPATs.The Commission believes that the use of VVPATs will bring utmost transparency and credibility in the voting systemThe audit trail will make the voters feel confident. Once done, India will be the first country in the world to have elections with 100% VVPAT.The EC will hold a challenge and also prove that EVMs cannot be tampered with.People who questioned reliability of EVMs have not yet submitted any proof or credible material to support their claim.EC told political parties that their suggestions have been heard and that building confidence is a shared responsibility.Once the voter keys in their vote, the ballot unit sends the vote to the control unit in an encrypted format.People allege that EVMs can be manipulated by infecting the chip with a Trojan horse. We would like to confirm that this is not possible. We do not have any wireless process.Physical manipulation is also totally ruled out as there are multiple layers of security as well as several layers of self-check features.16 lakh VVPAT machines have been sanctioned and money has been received by the EC for this. The amount we have got is over Rs. 3,000 crores."
"Support for Emmanuel Macron's party grows before French parliamentary election: Poll","http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/support-for-emmanuel-macrons-party-grows-before-french-parliamentary-election-poll-1695142","Paris:                             Support for French President Emmanuel Macron's new centrist party is growing before legislative elections next month, a poll found on Thursday, raising the chances that he will be able to win parliamentary backing for his reform plans.A Harris Interactive poll found Macron's Republic on the Move party, together with allies, set to win the largest share of the vote in the first round of the National Assembly elections on June 11.Thirty-two percent of 4,600 registered voters questioned planned to vote for Macron's party, it said.That was up three points from a similar poll on May 11 and up six points from a poll on May 7, the day that Macron defeated far-right leader Marine Le Pen to become French president.Macron, 39, who smashed the traditional left-right grip on French politics to win the presidency, gave ministerial jobs to conservatives, socialists and political newcomers on Wednesday, appointing an unprecedented all-stripes cabinet to bridge divides and broaden his support.In a morning radio interview, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe dismissed a suggestion that the mixed government was an electoral gimmick, saying 'progress' was its unifying theme.""Clearly it is a government built to last,"" he told France Inter. ""As the legislatives approach, this (government) is of course essential, and will determine everything that happens afterwards. But the government is here to govern. It is here to prepare the recovery, it is here to create something, it is here to put projects in place.""The new cabinet will meet for the first time on Thursday.Under the French voting system, if no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round of voting for the National Assembly, the leading candidates go forward to a second round on June 18. The Harris poll gave no forecast of what would happen then or how many seats each party might win.But the poll's findings strengthen the chances that Macron will be able to count on parliamentary backing for his plans, which include corporate tax cuts, labour market reforms, and a 50 billion euro investment plan coupled with public spending savings.The Harris poll for French television found support for the centre-right The Republicans and the far-right National Front both on 19 percent, each down one point from the May 11 poll.Support for the far-left France Unbowed party rose a point to 15 percent while the Socialist Party's backing fell by a point to six percent.The online poll was carried out between May 15 and 17 - after Macron named conservative lawmaker Edouard Philippe as his prime minister and before the new government was unveiled on Wednesday.Six French voters out of 10 hope that Macron will have a majority in parliament, the Harris poll found.Macron's party announced a list of 428 candidates, most of them political unknowns, last Thursday to fight the parliamentary elections.But the party, which currently has no seats in the National Assembly, has yet to pick dozens of other candidates for the 577 seats at stake, hoping more politicians from other parties will switch sides.© Thomson Reuters 2017

"MCD Election Results 2017: A Trademark PM Modi Tactic, Used To Win Delhi, Could Repeat In Gujarat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/a-trademark-pm-modi-tactic-used-to-win-delhi-could-repeat-in-gujarat-1686289","New Delhi: HighlightsBJP fielded fresh faces in Delhi polls, dropped most sitting councillors
Party might replicate strategy in Gujarat assembly polls later this year
BJP performed extensively well in the UP elections last month
                                The BJP's standout strategy for the Delhi civic polls was the decision to drop almost all sitting councilors and field fresh faces. It did this to skirt an anti-incumbency sentiment amid allegations of corruption and non-performance in the three corporations, which it has dominated for years. The party's campaign stressed that it was bringing in fresh faces and fresh energy.

It worked. The BJP has won all three municipalities with a bigger margin than last time, and there is already talk about whether the party will look at replicating the strategy in the next big election it faces - the Gujarat assembly elections due at the end of this year. But, Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi's tweet today notes, the strategy was originally applied in Gujarat by then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.

""Narendra bhai had once replaced all Councillers in Guj & won 2/3 seats in local elections. Same strategy worked in MCD,"" Bihar's Mr Modi tweeted. PM Modi, as Chief Minister of Gujarat for 13 years, had in fact made it a practice to not field many sitting legislators in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 assembly elections too. In 2012, the BJP had dropped 40 per cent of its legislators opting for new candidates. Each time it won big.

The BJP has been in power in Gujarat for more than 19 years and could need to fall back upon the Modi strategy more than ever in the face of a build-up of the anti-incumbency factor. The party has struggled with containing the massive Patel agitation for reservation in government jobs and colleges and had a scare in 2015 when the Congress made inroads in rural areas in local body elections.

The BJP's superlative performance in the Uttar Pradesh elections last month - it won more than 300 of the state's 403 seats - has energised the party cadre in Gujarat as has an early start to its election campaign with both PM Modi and party chief Amit Shah making frequent visits to the state.
 BJP celebrations in Uttar Pradesh after the party emerged victorious in the state in the seven-phased assembly polls, that were held in February this year.Elections are also due next year in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, two other states where the BJP has been in power for some time now. Also in Rajasthan. The party could deny ticket to several legislators seen to have not performed, say sources.

A move like the one in Delhi to field fresh new faces will send out a message to the party's parliamentarians and legislators in other states that their selection to contest elections is not automatic, they will have to perform.

From crucial Uttar Pradesh, which sent 71 BJP lawmakers to parliament in the 2014 national elections, there have been complaints about the non-performance of MPs. The Prime Minister has reminded them at meetings that work must be done in their constituencies to electrify villages and implement central government schemes. With a BJP government now in the state they will also not have recourse to complaints about a non-cooperative state government.

There is now immense pressure on the party to deliver on promises. For PM Modi's bid for a second term in 2019, a repeat of the party's 2014 performance in UP is crucial."
"Not Joining BJP, Says Gujarat Congress Leader Who 'Unfollowed' Rahul Gandhi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/not-joining-bjp-says-congress-leader-shankersinh-vaghela-after-he-unfollows-rahul-gandhi-on-twitter-1693838","Ahmedabad:                             Gujarat Congress leader Shankarsinh Vaghela today said his ""unfollowing"" party vice president Rahul Gandhi on Twitter does not signal a return to the BJP. He has described his decision to do so - he stopped following not only Mr Gandhi but everyone else - as a move towards winding down activity on social media ahead of the Gujarat assembly elections later this year.

This, Mr Vaghela explained to reporters on Monday, was necessary to stop ""spreading of false messages and speculation"" about him; it was ""not personal"" he said. The 76-year-old is in fact seen to be sulking with his party after it said it will not project any one as presumptive Chief Minister. Mr Vaghela's supporters have been pushing for the Congress to project him for Gujarat Chief Minister.  

The former Chief Minister waited a full day after his Twitter move before making the clarification. In that time, there was much speculation about his return to the BJP, especially after his recent meeting with the party's president Amit Shah, who too is from Gujarat. He had also skipped an event organised by the state Congress' IT cell yesterday.

On Twitter, as Mr Vaghela spring-cleaned his account, he also deleted all anti-BJP posts from his account. And he did not touch a pinned tweet from April that praises Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a one-time friend turned rival. ""I appreciate @narendramodi for removing red beacons. This was something I had implemented during my chief minister tenure in 1996-97,"" Mr Vaghela had tweeted, commenting on PM Modi's decision to ban VIPs from the lal batti or red beacon on their cars.

""I am already active in the Congress...you should not worry that I will go anywhere else,' Mr Vaghela said today.

Ashok Gehlot, the Congress' Gujarat chief, had last week at a party meeting said, ""There are rumours again and again about Shankersinh Vaghela joining the BJP. Why don't you just ask him.""

Mr Gehlot asserted that the Congress is not splitting months ahead of the elections, when it hopes to dislodge the BJP after 20 years of ruling Gujarat. The party, which has lost a series of assembly elections in different states to the BJP in recent months, can ill-afford a rebellion by Mr Vaghela. 36 of the Congress' 57 legislators demanded last month that he be projected for Chief Minister if the Congress wants to win the Gujarat elections. Mr Gehlot had ruled out that out.

Shankersinh Vaghela was in the BJP for many years and shared a close bond with PM Modi, going back to their days together in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). They, however, fell out when Mr Vaghela was sidelined for Chief Minister. He quit the BJP and launched his own party, before joining the Congress."
"Ashok Gehlot Appointed Congress General Secretary In-Charge For Gujarat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-made-congress-general-secretary-in-charge-for-gujarat-1686262","New Delhi:                             The Congress party today appointed former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot as its general secretary in-charge for Gujarat, ahead of assembly polls later this year.

Mr Gehlot replaced Gurudas Kamat, who has handled the party's affairs till now. Mr Kamat has had internal problems within the party in Maharashtra after the Congress' debacle in state civic polls.

The Congress has revamped the entire team in Gujarat by replacing the general secretary incharge and appointing four new secretaries.

""Congress President Sonia Gandhi has assigned the task of looking after Gujarat affairs to a new AICC team that includes general secretary incharge Ashok Gehlot and four new AICC secretaries,"" AICC general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said.

Among the new four All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretaries appointed for Gujarat affairs include former Youth Congress chief Rajeev Satav, Harshvardhan Sapkal, Varsha Gaikwad and Jeetu Patwari.

The Congress is working overtime to put its act together and put up a stiff fight to the BJP in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Assembly elections are due in November this year in Gujarat."

The BJP president will be present at Ravidas Ashram, under New Delhi Parliamentary constituency, to listen to PM Modi's monthly radio address to the nation on Sunday, 11 AM, said party vice-president and Delhi unit in-charge Shyam Jaju.

""We have instructed our party workers to connect people with Mann Ki Baat and get them to listen to it. Our party president will visit Ravidas Ashram under the same programme,"" Mr Jaju told PTI.

Delhi BJP leaders said that the party chief will also interact with locals and learn their hardships and problems.

""The party has promised to provide housing facilities to all by 2022. The policy of 'Jahan Jhuggi Wahin Makan' given by BJP will be boosted by Shah's visit as he could advise the Centre about it,"" said a senior Delhi BJP leader.

The party president may also have lunch with the local people during the visit, he added.

The recent victory of BJP in the MCD polls was attributed to Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari's connect with residents of unauthorised colonies, slums and rural parts of the city.

Mr Tiwari who had spent new year's eve at Inderpuri slum after assuming charge of Delhi BJP unit in November last year, has launched a programme of developing slums into 'model dwellings' on the lines of Adarsh Gram Yojna.

Another party leader and Union minister Vijay Goel too has come out with his 'Adopt A Slum' scheme under which the municipal councillors will adopt and develop slums in their wards.

The massive victory of BJP in MCD polls, has rekindled the party's hope of recapturing power in Delhi by repeating the feat in next Assembly elections due in 2020.

A tussle has been reported widely between Mr Tiwari and Mr Goel over the leadership in Delhi, although the two met recently to settle their misunderstandings as per instructions of the party leadership.

Delhi BJP leaders including Mr Tiwari maintained a distance from Goel's 'Slum Yuva Daud' held today at DU marking launch of his 'Adopt A Slum' campaign, despite the national leadership's instructions to support the programme."
"EVMs Used In Uttarakhand Polls To Be Seized, Says High Court","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/evms-used-in-uttarakhand-polls-to-be-taken-in-judicial-custody-court-1686637","Nainital: HighlightsEVMs used in Vikasnagar constituency to be taken into judicial custody
Congress' Nav Prabhat had alleged tampered EVMs helped BJP candidate win
Election Commission has strongly denied claims of EVM rigging so far
                                Electronic Voting Machines or EVMs used for the Vikasnagar constituency in the Uttarakhand assembly elections earlier this year will be taken in court's custody, the state's High Court has ruled, as it admitted a petition by a Congressman who lost the election from that seat.

Senior Uttarakhand Congress leader, Nav Prabhat, has challenged the election of the BJP's Munna Singh Chauhan from Vikasnagar, near capital Dehradun, alleging that the EVMs were rigged. 

Opposition parties have alleged that the BJP's landslide win in Uttarakhand and neighbouring key state Uttar Pradesh last month was aided by tampered EVMs. The Election Commission has emphatically said EVMs cannot be rigged. 

The Uttarakhand High Court has asked the Election Commission, the state poll panel and Mr Chauhan to send their replies within six weeks to notices that it served today. It has also asked the election commissions not to use the Vikasnagar EVMs for any elections till it issues further orders. The EVMs have not been used since the Uttarkahand elections since vote machines deployed for an election are not used again for at least two months after results are announced. 

About 11,000 EVMs were used for the elections for Uttarakhand's 70 assembly seats; 139 EVM sets were used in Vikasnagar.

The BJP swept the hill state winning 57 seats, and the Congress has won 11. In Vikasnagar, Mr Chauhan beat Mr Nav Prabhat by a margin of more than 6,000 votes.

The Congress and other opposition parties have raised the EVM controversy in parliament and outside demanding that future elections be held on paper ballot. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had sought that paper ballots be used for municipal elections in Delhi and several of its leaders have attributed the BJP's huge win in results announced yesterday to ""manipulated EVMs"".

The BJP has dismissed the allegations, calling its rivals poor losers. It has also asked the Congress why it has not questioned EVMs in Punjab, the only state it won in the assembly elections held in five states. Mr Kejriwal has, however, alleged tampering of EVMs in the Punjab election, in which his AAP fared poorly."
"Stay Humble, Don't Get Complacent: Amit Shah To BJP Workers","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/stay-humble-dont-get-complacent-amit-shah-to-bjp-workers-1688813","Lucknow:                             Stay humble and do not get complacent, BJP national president Amit Shah told party workers on Tuesday, while attributing to them its overwhelming victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

The party workers should not feel relaxed and complacent after the BJP's win in UP. Instead, more efforts should be made to improve party's prospects on the assembly seats and booths where it is weak, Mr Shah said.

He was addressing the state executive meeting of the BJP on concluding day of its two-day meet, which was held for the first time after the saffron party stormed to power in the recent Assembly elections.

Terming the BJP as a ""party of patriots"", Mr Shah said, ""The party workers must not sit back and relax, but make efforts to reachout those booths, where it is weak and tell people about the various welfare schemes initiated by the Centre and state governments, thereby increasing the membership of the party.""

Noting that there were 16,000 workers in the BJP, he said if one party worker decides to strengthen five booths, then the party would automatically reach to 80,000 booths.

""The party workers must go the booth level and work with the dalits, the poor and the labourers, and tell them about the various welfare measures of the Centre and state government,"" he said.

The people should be told how the party came up with the 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra' before the UP assembly elections while working on 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas', Mr Shah said.

Lauding the hard work of party workers, he said, ""It is due to their toil that BJP which started as a 10-member party is now having 11 crore members, and is the largest political party in the world.""

""It is because of the hardwork of the party workers that the party has formed government on its own strength in 14 states, while it shares power with allies in three states,"" he said.

The party has 282 MPs in Lok Sabha and 1,387 MLAs throughout the country, he pointed out.

""But, the party workers should not feel relaxed or complacent and take steps to ensure that BJP makes inroads to each and every part of India,"" he said.

After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, people of UP wanted to get rid of casteism, dynastic politics and appeasement, and they have given a green signal by voting for the BJP, heralding a new era in the state, he said, and added that UP had been suffering from policy paralysis all these years.

""It is for these reasons that the BJP did not name its election yatras as 'Vijay Yatra' but called them 'Parivartan Yatra'. Our main aim was to help UP get free from the 15 years of misrule of SP and BSP. The Yogi government will do 'sabka saath, sabka vikaas', and we are seeing glimpses of this in the first few months,"" he added."
"In Congress Stronghold, Amit Shah Sets 150-Seat Target For BJP In Gujarat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amit-shahs-simple-formula-for-setting-150-seat-target-for-bjp-in-gujarat-1706409","Chota Udepur, Gujarat: HighlightsTarget is to win 150 of Gujarat's 182 seats: BJP chief Amit Shah
Amit Shah covered 3 booths in a door to door campaign in Devaliya village
The tribal vote matters in 27 of the state's constituencies
                                Workers of the BJP will fan out in 48,000 booths to reach the maximum number of people before assembly elections Gujarat, as the party seeks to retain the state for the sixth time.  The target is to win 150 of Gujarat's 182 seats, said BJP chief Amit Shah on Wednesday, offering a simple formula.  

""We won 120 seats when Narendrabhai was Chief Minister. Now when he is Prime Minister, we should win 150,"" Mr Shah said. 

The BJP chief was in Devaliya village in the tribal belt of Chota Udepur in central Gujarat and covered three booths in a door to door campaign. The area is seen as a Congress stronghold and Mr Shah told party workers, ""Whatever seats we win or lose, we must not lose from Devaliya...I have myself come amidst you to motivate you."" 

With elections now six months away, the BJP strategically chose the tribal area for the party president to kick off the booth management campaign. The powerful Patels who have traditionally supported the BJP are miffed with the ruling party over their demand for reservation in government jobs and colleges not being met. As it looks to consolidate the support if other communities, the 15 per cent tribal vote can be a crucial addition. 

The tribal vote matters in 27 of the state's constituencies.

As he has done in recent tours of other states, Amit Shah had lunch at the home of a resident of Devaliya village Popat Vasava, whose family was ecstatic at getting to host the BJP president. Their home has a brand new toilet added recently right at the entrance and a permanent gas connection. 

Food for the BJP chief was cooked on a gas stove and not a chullal or coal stove. Mr Vasava denied that these were recent gifts linked to the VIP visit. ""We got the toilet made about a month back from government grant. And we got the gas connection under the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category,"" he said. 

Gujarat is the home state of both Mr Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was Chief Minister for 13 years before he moved to Delhi after the BJP won the 2014 national elections.  The party has since won a series of state elections and has started an early campaign to also retain Gujarat. Apart from the BJP's traditional rival in the state, the Congress, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party too is contesting in the state."

"UP Elections 2017: Not Religion Or Caste, Bareilly Votes For Jobs","http://www.ndtv.com/assembly/up-elections-2017-not-religion-or-caste-bareilly-votes-for-jobs-1659760","BAREILLY:                             Ravi Singh Rawat expected to land a white-collar job once he graduated. But the student of economics who spoke fluent English, found jobs were not easy to come by. After three years of futile search, the 24-year-old ended up working in a small motorcycle repair shop in Bareilly's Civil Lines.

""""I was one of the brightest in my class but there are no jobs... I don't like doing this, but I have a family to feed. I had to do something,"" he said, staring at his grease-stained hands and dirty work clothes.

That is the story of many in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly, the state's seventh-largest city which votes on Wednesday. In 2015, when the Akhilesh Yadav government advertised for 368 peons, it received nearly 23 lakh applications. Every tenth was from a graduate or a post-graduate, and more than 200 aspirants were research scholars.

Tackling unemployment among the educated young men and women has been a challenge that successive governments in state capital Lucknow - including the Samajwadi Party government -- have been unable to face up to.

It is a point the leaders of the BJP - which hadn't been in power in the state for more than 20 years -- have rubbed in over the last few weeks of campaign. In Bareilly, the party is competing with the ruling Samajwadi Party and its ally Congress for the same votebank. BJP candidate Arun Kumar had won the seat in 2012 and hopes to repeat his performance -- his party hopes to benefit from the divided votes.

But the ban on high-value currency notes in November to flush out black money - a move the BJP claims has huge support from the people -- appears to have created some difficulties in small towns like Bareilly. It has further shrunk employment opportunities in a state that is now estimated to have over one crore unemployed people in the 15 to 35 year age group.

Many flourishing businesses in Bareilly - once known for its furniture and woven cots - are on the verge of a collapse. ""I haven't been able to source raw-material, can't pay my labourers,"" said Abdul Rafeek, whose family has been making cots for four generations.

A young furniture labour, Amit Sharma too blames demonetisation for the decline in his income. ""We have lost 70% of our business due to the notes ban. There was a time when I didn't have money to buy milk for the house,"" he says.

A daily wager at a transport company, Raje agrees. ""My earnings of Rs 300 have been reduced to Rs 150 all because of demonetisation... There is no work! Where do we go?"" he says. ""This election is neither on religion, nor on caste. We shall vote only for employment,"" he says."

"UP Elections 2017: BJP Bets On Man Who Ended Its Winning Streak In Allahabad","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjp-bets-on-man-who-ended-its-winning-streak-in-allahabad-1660382","Allahabad:                             An industrialist-turned-party-hopping politician has been fielded by BJP in Allahabad South assembly segment with the hope that the man who had ended its winning streak in the constituency a decade ago as a BSP man, might now wrest the seat from SP.

On February 23, when voters of the constituency will exercise their franchise, 43-year-old Nand Gopal Gupta ""Nandi"" shall be looking forward to avenging the defeat of 2012 at the hands of sitting Samajwadi Party MLA Haji Parvez, to whom he had lost by a slender margin of less than 400 votes.

While Mr Gupta is the BJP candidate this time, the BSP - which expelled him three years ago - has fielded Mashooq Khan as part of a strategy to give a substantial number of tickets to those belonging to minority community.

 The Congress, which Mr Gupta had joined upon his expulsion from BSP and quit only last month, will end up supporting Mr Parvez owing to its alliance with the Samajwadi Party.

Mr Gupta's electoral debut in 2007 had caused the BJP to lose its grip over the assembly segment which it had never lost since 1989.

'Nandi' had defeated, by a margin of more than 14,000 votes, Keshri Nath Tripathi who was a five-time MLA, and had served thrice as the Uttar Pradesh assembly Speaker and was the BJP's state unit president at that time.

Emerging as the proverbial dark horse in an electoral contest that was being viewed as a ""clash of titans"", 'Nandi' had humbled Tripathi and relegated Rita Bahuguna Joshi, then the Congress woman's wing president and its future state unit chief, to the position of a distant third.

Interestingly, Mr Joshi, too, is contesting the current elections on a BJP ticket, from the Lucknow Cantt seat.

The BJP could not recover from the upset it suffered in 2007 as Tripathi finished third in the electoral contest five years later.

He has now moved out of the state on a gubernatorial assignment."

Sunday was also the third phase of polling for UP Assembly elections
Her in-laws agreed to delay the ceremony so the bride could vote
                                Every vote counts. In every election – state or general. And this bindaas bride from Lucknow knows it.

Manisha Kashyap, who got married on Saturday, February 18 in Lucknow, decided to delay her bidaai ceremony so she could vote in the February 19 polls instead.

The bidaai ceremony traditionally marks the end of a Hindu wedding ceremony and is when a bride officially ‘leaves’ her home and family behind.

Assembly elections are currently being held in Manisha’s home state of Uttar Pradesh and Sunday marked the third phase of polling. Elections across the state are being conducted in seven phases. The votes will finally be counted on March 11.

""A few Election Commission officials visited us and made us aware,"" Manisha explained. ""That’s why I decided to do this.""

So Manisha’s bidaai ceremony will now take place a few days after her wedding, on February 21, instead of the day after, February 19, as is usually done.

The best thing is that Manisha’s in-laws are totally on board with her decision. ""My in-laws fully support this decision,"" she said proudly.

""There is a message for the whole nation - that every daughter, every son and all citizens should exercise their right to vote,"" the bride's father told news agency ANI.

And Manisha is not the only one to choose to do her democratic duty on her big day.

Another pair of newlyweds were spotted casting their vote in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh.

The voter is India's former Prime Minister and BJP co-founder Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who has represented the city of Nawabs five times in the Lok Sabha from 1991 to 2009. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh is the incumbent parliamentarian from Lucknow.

Mr Vajpayee, 92, has been suffering from age-related ailments and has not been seen in public for years.

""The last time Atal Bihar Vajpayee voted was in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, which was also the last election he ever contested. Thereafter, he could not vote in the assembly elections of 2007, 2012 as well as the Lok Sabha elections of 2009 and 2014,"" said Shiv Kumar, a close aide of the ailing leader, to news agency Press Trust of India.

He added that this time too, the former Prime Minister ""would be unable to cast his vote in the ongoing polls"".

BJP state spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi, commenting on Mr Vajpayee, said, ""Though Atalji would not be able to cast his vote for the party candidate, his blessings are always with us. With this, we would surge ahead in the electoral battlefield.""

Atal Bihar Vajpayee is a former three-time Prime Minister of India. His first term lasted for 13 days in 1996. His second term lasted from 1998 to 1999 whereas his third term came between 1999 and 2004. The BJP patriarch is the first non-Congress leader to complete a full-term as Prime Minister. Mr Vajpayee also holds the distinction of being the first Indian leader to deliver a speech in Hindi at the UN General Assembly. He was conferred the Bharat Ratna in 2014 by President Pranab Mukherjee, who broke protocol to present him with the award at his residence.

The former Chief Minister cast her vote in poll booth number 251 in Lucknow. She also addressed the media after casting her vote and urged voters of the 12 districts to cast their ballots in large numbers.

""Firstly, I would like to urge each and every voter in the third phase to come out and cast their ballot in their respective polling booths,"" she said.

Ms Mayawati further stated that she was confident of the Bahujan Samaj Party's victory in the Uttar Pradesh election.

""Two phases of the election have already been held and on that basis, I can confidently say that BSP will secure the maximum seats in the third phase.We will emerge as the single largest party with at least 300 seats,"" the Rajya Sabha member said.

Ms Mayawati also took a potshot at her rivals - the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP.

""We don't build castles in the air like the Samajwadi Party, Congress or the BJP,"" she jibed.

""People are turning out in large numbers at my rallies. They are sick of the Samajwadi Party's goondaraj and jungleraaj. Uttar Pradesh wants an environment of peace. Even the BJP has failed to fulfill even a fourth of their Lok Sabha promises,"" she added.  

Ms Mayawati seeks to become a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh after being in the opposition for five years. Her party performed dismally in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where it failed to win a single seat. This time, the BSP has fielded a record number of Muslim candidates to win over the community, which is seen as a major votebank of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress."

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also shared the dais to extend support to her brother and Congress workers. Ms Vadra's entry in the campaign came after Union Minister Smriti Irani said that the Congress' star campaigner was trying to avoid ""people's questions"" about the ""unfulfilled promises"" of the Congress.

The Congress has forged an alliance with the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state and much of the credit for this alliance was accorded to Ms Vadra. While Ms Vadra has refused to play a pro-active role in politics, she has campaigned for her mother and brother in their respective parliamentary constituencies - Raebareli and Amethi - in the past.  

Scheduled for 19 February, the third phase will witness polls in 69 constituencies spread across 12 districts. The third phase will also see heavyweights contest the polls in Lucknow, Kanpur, Kannauj, Etawah among others.

Here are the highlights of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's speech in Raebareli:A few months ago, Congress took out a 30-day long yatra in Uttar Pradesh.We spoke to farmers about their issues.The farmers said three things: Rain, hail and Modiji doesn't give us compensations.They want loans to be waived, electricity rates halved and the right price for our produce.Two crore farmers reached out to us.I went to PM Modi and I said you have forgone debts of rich industrialists. You may do that as you are the Prime Minister. But you should also think of the farmers of Uttar Pradesh.And his response? Not one word about farmers and their debts.While campaigning in Uttar Pradesh, he said, ""As soon as you elect the BJP, we will waive off your loans"".What kind of deal are you trying to strike here?The Congress had waived off farmers' loans, even when it wasn't in power.Same thing happened to Bihar. He promised a special package of lakhs of crorers to them if they elected the BJP.Did Bihar get the package? No.Wherever he goes, he says these things.Like Shah Rukh Khan in his film, Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, he promised Acche Din.But 2.5 years later, we see Gabbar Singh from Sholay.While campaigning, he promised to change Varanasi. He called it his mother.Modiji, relationships are not fulfilled with talks but actions.I have a list of things that he promised Varanasi - clean Ganga, Ghats, Ring Road, free WiFi, Bhojpuri Film City.Modiji, you have not even fulfilled the promises you made to your mother.I urge friends from the media to go there. I know you are under pressure, but please do your job. Show us if the film city has been built.This is Modiji's approach to things. He said: India is dirty. You clean up. I have to go to America and meet Obama. I'll check when I'm back.On November 8, he stood before you and said, ""I have a new idea.""He told you that the savings that mothers and sisters have saved up, I want to convert it to paper. You should go stand in queues in front of banks.After notes ban, Modiji waived 1,200 crore of Vijay Mallya's loans.You tell me: If this money was given to the youth, the women, the farmers - wouldn't it have helped Uttar Pradesh? But instead, he helped rich industrialists.We wanted to build a food park here, set up 40 factories.Why? Because today, farmers sell their produce to mandis. We wanted to sell them directly to factories so that they get the right price for what they produce.The peppermint from here would have gone all over the world. The US President would eat a mint and it would read, 'Made in Raebareli'.All this, despite the 'Make in India' program.The reality is that the only ones benefitting from PM Modi's schemes are India's richest families.Forget 'Make in India', he has snatched away 'Made in Raebareli' from you. That is because he wanted to take revenge.He has stalled the Railway factory, not letting it go ahead.In just Rs 20,000, you can change lives of families here. But no, you won't give them money.You will money to chors like Vijay Mallya.Mallya sells liquor in India. You will give him thousands of crores. The farmer who gives you his sweat and blood - you don't even give them Rs 50. What kind of a government is this?We will help the small entrepreneurs. We will give them all the loans they want. On he condition that they employ 200-300 people.Tell me, how many people has Mallya given jobs to?If you vote for Congress-Samajwadi Party, it will be a government for farmers and women."

""Just like the first phase, the second phase of polling in 67 seats which took place today is a good indication that BSP is coming to power in UP with full majority,"" she said in a statement.

Congratulating her party workers and leaders besides the people of the state, Ms Mayawati said there were reports that polling in the remaining five phases of the crucial state polls will be equally encouraging for her party.

""Although leaders of parties like BJP and SP-Congress alliance are making tall claims of support coming their way, people only have faith on 'tried and tested' BSP leadership as they know she (Mayawati) believes in saying and doing the same thing and will fulfil the promise on ending 'Jungleraj' and bringing rule of law after coming to power,"" she added.

Nearly 60 per cent voting was recorded till 4 PM in the second phase polling in 67 Assembly constituencies across 11 districts of western Uttar Pradesh today.

"UP Elections 2017: Yadav Takeover Of State Police? Not At All, Say Yadavs","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-yadav-takeover-of-state-police-not-at-all-say-yadavs-1661570","Etawah:                             Law and order in Uttar Pradesh has been one of the main targets of the BJP in this assembly election in the state. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken of what his party alleges is the Yadav takeover of the state police. He had also spoken of discrimination, which he called the biggest problem of the state. Three days ago, at a rally in Barabanki, PM Modi said, ""Akhilesh-ji has turned police stations into Samajwadi Party offices. If you go to a police station, you will find the inspector and you will find 5-6 goondas"".

At the high-profile Saifai police station in the Yadav stronghold Etawah, Gopal Singh Yadav -- the latest in a two-decade list of Yadav in-charges, with just a few exceptions -- refuses to discuss the merit of his 2-month-old posting.

But six men sitting on the porch of the police station, sipping tea, say they are more than willing to discuss the merits of the Prime Minister's allegation. The men, who came to the police station to pay a courtesy call, are from the adjoining Zafarpur gram panchayat. Three of them are Samajwadi Party leaders and all are Yadavs.  

""Modi is not saying the right thing. If someone is talented, he can get posted anywhere. Whoever is talented, he or she will go... whatever the department is. What jobs have Modi given?"" questions Uttam Yadav, who is in his early 20s.

There aren't any hard numbers in the public domain to support the BJP, or even Mayawati's allegations that Yadavs are being favoured in postings and recruitment in the state police. If it has had an effect on policing, there is just one number: In 2015, UP recorded the highest crime rate against Dalits across the country at over 8,300 incidents.

On Sunday, at his Fatehpur rally in Bundelkhand, PM Modi had also spoken of discrimination, calling it the state's biggest problem. ""If you ask any Dalit whether they get opportunity, they say it's given to the Other Backward Castes and if you ask OBCs, they will say it's only given to Yadavs,"" he had said.

At Etawah's Rai Nagar village, a few kilometres from Saifai, a group of Jatav or Scheduled Caste villagers -- traditional Mayawati supporters -- second the claim.

Dharmendra Kumar, 23, says he appeared for police entrance exams in 2013, but did not get through. ""If I were a Yadav, I would have got through. My friend got into the Lekhpal's written exam. Because he was not a Yadav, he was not selected in the viva,"" says Dharmendra, even though he admits that he has no evidence to back his claims. ""Everything is based on caste considerations. If Modi comes here, at least things will be better.""

""Mayawati has said many times that if there has been any favouritism in recruitments there will be an inquiry,"" says Narendra Nath, the BSP candidate from Etawah.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has not reacted to charges so far. Instead, he has focused on the improvement in police delivery mechanisms including these first responders -- dial 100 cars."

Mr Ibobi Singh will fight on a Congress ticket. The chief minister said with conviction the Congress party would return with a ""thumping"" majority and would form the government for the fourth consecutive term.  

Sharmila filed her nominations on behalf of her People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA), which is making an electoral debut this year.

Anti-AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) crusader Irom Sharmila, who ended her 16-year-long hunger strike in August 2016, will be one of the main opponents against the Congress veteran in Thoubal. She reached Thoubal on her bicycle, covering a distance of over 20km from Imphal, flanked by her party activists. PRJA is hoping to make an impact using alternative political practices.

Mr Ibobi Singh, the three-time chief minister of Manipur, is eyeing for a fourth term in office after being elected successively in 2002, 2007 and 2012 respectively. ""The ruling Congress shall win absolute majority in the non-Naga areas. There are 10 seats in the constituencies dominated by the Nagas. We are hoping to bag at least half,"" he told the media.

Naga groups are reportedly staunchly opposed to the Congress party and Mr Ibobi Singh.

Many of the politicians were asked to resign from the assembly and contest only after joining other parties, said sources.

Polling for the 60-member Manipur Assembly will take place in two phases on March 4 and March 8 respectively, results for which will be declared on March 11.
In the last Assembly polls, the Congress had won 42 seats and Okram Ibobi Singh was re-elected as the chief minister.

The total number of voters in the state is around 19 lakh and the number of women voters is much higher than that of men.Women play an important role in Manipuri society but the number of women candidates put up by the political parties is far less when compared to that of men, sources from Election Commission said.

The ruling Congress and the BJP which are the main contenders in the upcoming polls have fielded only two candidates each. The TMC which came out with a list 24 candidates also has two women candidates.

Human rights activist Irom Sharmila's Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA), contesting from three seats has fielded two women, including Sharmila herself.

The National People's Party (NPP) has fielded only one woman candidate out of their 21 total number of candidates.

A senior Congress leader of Manipur state Congress unit said, ""Actually we had only received applications from four women candidates. Only two were given tickets based on their ability to win the seats. And secondly, in Manipur, women are not very much interested in politics.""

Keeping aside their ideological and political differences, the views of Congress were echoed by BJP state unit on this issue.

""We had given tickets based on the winning ability of candidates. And women are not very much interested in politics,"" a senior state BJP leader said.

But PRJA and TMC had different views on why a small number of women found place in candidate list.

""Out of three candidates that we had fielded two are women. This shows our commitment towards women empowerment. But the candidate list of big parties like BJP and Congress show that they are not at all interested in women politics. Shame on them,"" Erendro Leichonbam of PRJA said.

The TMC on the other hand blamed politics of violence and intimidation as the main reason behind the party not fielding women candidates.

""We wanted to field more women candidates. But we couldn't as there is a reign of terror and women are afraid to come out,"" TMC's leader in-charge of Manipur elections Samrat Tapadar told PTI.

In the outgoing state assembly, there are only three women MLAs and one of them is a minister in the state ministry.

Mr Mishra also hit out at the alliance between Samajwadi Party and Congress, saying that the alliance will ""fall apart soon after its defeat"".

""To save itself from a drubbing in the polls, Samajwadi party has formed an alliance with the Congress. It was an act of desperation. This opportunistic coalition will fall apart soon after its defeat,"" Mr Mishra said.

""Criminals have ruled the roost during Akhilesh Yadav's tenure as the Chief Minister and it is amusing to hear his platitudes about development and women's empowerment. Murder and loot take place in broad daylight and rapes have become commonplace,"" the BJP leader alleged.

""The BJP has gained a decisive lead in the first phase of the Assembly polls held last week. This has sent all our opponents into a tizzy. The trend will continue in the second phase of polling which is underway today and also in the remaining five phases and BJP will form government in the state,"" he asserted.

Mr Mishra, who was in Allahabad to campaign in support of BJP candidates in various Assembly segments, claimed the Narendra Modi government has granted assistance of ""more than Rs. 7 lakh
crore"" to Uttar Pradesh so far.

A contest between Aparna Yadav and Rita Bahuguna Joshi in Lucknow Cantonment constituency is to watch out for.

The maximum number of candidates in fray are from Etawah (21) -- the home town of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, while the least number is in Haidergarh (3) assembly constituency of Barabanki, neighbouring the state capital.

Lucknow Central and Lucknow West have 17 candidates each, while Farrukhabad and Bhojpur have 20 each.

The third phase comes as the biggest litmus test for the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) as it held 55 of these 69 seats in the 2012 assembly polls.

Of the remaining seats, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) held six, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) five and Congress two in the last election. One seat was won by an independent.

Other than the stronghold of Etawah, which is the home turf of the Yadav clan, the popularity of Akhilesh Yadav is also up for test, especially after the ugly power struggle that was witnessed over the past few months in the state's first family and the ruling party.

Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav has not campaigned for the SP which he founded 25 years ago.

Sullen at his unceremonious ouster by son Akhilesh Yadav in January from the post of national president, Mulayam Singh has only sought votes for his younger brother Shivpal Yadav, who is contesting from the Jaswantnagar seat in Etawah and daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, who is a candidate from Lucknow Cantonment."
"UP Elections 2017: End Dynastic, Caste-Based Politics, Says Amit Shah","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-end-dynastic-caste-based-politics-says-amit-shah-1660343","Amethi:                             The ongoing Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh is to end dynastic and caste-based politics, BJP chief Amit Shah said today in Amethi, the pocket borough of the Nehru-Gandhi family.

Targeting Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he said that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party have entered into an ""unholy alliance"".

""Two families have entered into an unholy alliance. Initially, people were affected by one shahzada (prince), now it is two. One shahzada is giving pain to his mother, the other to his father,"" he said, attacking Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, who had a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav over the control over SP.

 He asked the voters to shun dynastic and caste-based politics, noting that everything in the state veered around one family.

""What has this family given you? There are problems for farmers while law and order machinery in the state has collapsed. There is acute shortage of water and medicines. What has this state government done for you?"" he asked.

""For the past 50 years, only one family is running the affairs of Amethi. Even then, this place is languishing behind other districts in terms of development,"" he said. 

Mr Gandhi represents Amethi in the Lok Sabha.

Reacting to Rahul Gandhi seeking a performance report from Prime Minister Narendra Modi after two-and-a-half years in office, the BJP chief said, ""We will give details of each and everything. But, tell me what has your family done for the country? People of Amethi are asking this question.""

In a jibe at Mr Gandhi, he advised him to remove his ""Italian curtains"" to have a better vision of things, in an apparent reference to his mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi's Italian origin.

The Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh is being held in seven phases."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Heavy Weights Battling It Out In Phase 3","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-heavy-weights-battling-it-out-in-phase-3-1660765","New Delhi:                             The third phase of Uttar Pradesh's assembly elections sees a tight contest among Bharatiya Janata Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party- Congress alliance for 69 seats in the state's legislature. All the three sides have fielded 69 candidates for the seats. In the alliance, the Congress alone fields only nine candidates, the other 60 are represented by the ruling Samajwadi Party. After the relatively calm two phases, this phase is also expected to be calm as voters queue up to make their choice.

Among the candidates, contesting this Sunday, there are no heavyweights fielded from Mayawati's BSP. But, both BJP and SP will witness the test of fate for some of its most promising leaders. Lucknow cantonment sees a fierce contest between newcomer Aparna Yadav, the 'chhoti bahu' (younger daughter-in-law) of Mulayam Singh Yadav playing the field against popular seasoned politician Rita Bahuguna Joshi from the BJP. Although, Ms Joshi has been in politics for nearly two decades, it is only few months ago that she made the switch from Congress into the BJP.

Also contesting is Samajwadi Party heavyweight, Shivpal Singh Yadav, Mulayam Singh's brother. Mr Shivpal has been in the eye of the storm for the last few months as the family feud of the Yadav clan came in the public eye. He is contesting from Jaswantnagar, the place where the Samajwadi patriarch Mulayam held his first rally for this election.

The seven-phase assembly election in Uttar Pradesh remains crucial as it is the state that sends most number of Rajya Sabha members to the parliament.

The fourth phase of the election, scheduled for Thursday, will witness voters in 53 constituencies across 12 districts, including Raebareli, Allahabad and Jhansi. Yesterday, at a rally in Fatehpur, the Prime Minister had mocked Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for trying up with the Congress. He also took potshots at the ruling Samajwadi Party government for the lack of basic amenities such as electricity in the state. He also said that discrimination on basis of caste and religion is one of the biggest issues that plague Uttar Pradesh.

The high-octane assembly elections are currently underway in India's most populous state, which is expected to lay the groundwork for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While the Samajwadi Party seeks to retain the state, this time with the Congress, the BJP and the Mayawati-led BSP are fighting to make a comeback.

Here are the live updates of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech in Orai:Ram, Ram to everyone.I have had the good fortune of coming here over the years.The last time when I took the yatra from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, I had come here.You have come here in large numbers to bless the BJP, and I thank you.The election is not just about what the government or what minister will come to power. It is much bigger than that.UP's development is in tatters. But Bundelkhand has been hit the worst.Such governments have been elected in UP; they have destroyed you.SP, BSP, Congress - they are different sides of the same coin.Don't listen to them. Don't even listen to me. But ask your soul.Whoever has come to power, they have all robbed you.The BJP promises you: the next government will UP will have the provision to listen to Bundelkhand.Special measures will be taken to solve the problems of Bundelkhand.After the BJP government is formed in UP, a special board for Bundelkhand's development will be formed under the chief minister. A weekly record will be sought from it.At 8 pm on November 8, I said the ones who have looted the poor will have to pay back.Aren;t the SP and BSP staunch rivals? But I was amazed when all the opposition parties started speaking in one voice when I banned 500 and 1000 rupee notes and asked for records of black money hoarders.Behenji (Mayawati) said there was not enough planning. I asked her, planning by the government or you?She said a week should have been given. Had I done that, the people who looted would have vanished. The money would not have come to banks.Her problem is that she did not get enough time to prepare.Her question is why the accounts of her brother are being talked about. She accuses that it is so because of the elections.No, Behenji. It is because you deposited 100 crore just after the notes ban.BSP no longer Bahujan Samaj Party...it is now Behenji Sampatti Party"
"Midterm Polls In Maharashtra Inevitable, Says Sharad Pawar","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/midterm-polls-in-maharashtra-inevitable-says-sharad-pawar-1660978","Mumbai:                             Warning that midterm assembly elections in Maharashtra were ""inevitable"", Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar on Saturday said there was no question of his party propping up the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the state.

Mr Pawar told the media that he was even ready to put down his decision in writing and submit a copy to the Governor.

""I can right now give a letter to this effect and forward it to the Governor. But even Shiv Sena should submit a similar letter to him and make it public,"" Mr Pawar added, putting the ball in the Sena court over the fate of the government headed by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.

The Shiv Sena in the past few weeks has bitterly criticised the BJP in the state and at the Centre, saying the Maharashtra government was, ""on a notice period"", indicating it may withdraw support after the outcome of the civic elections on February 23.

Soon after the 2014 October assembly elections, the NCP had extended outside support to the BJP's minority government as Shiv Sena sat in the opposition for a month.

Around a month later, the Sena left the opposition benches to join the BJP as an ally.

The NCP chief had then justified its decision to provide external support to the BJP, ""in the interest of political stability and to avoid a fresh round of elections"".

In the past assembly elections, Maharashtra threw up a fractured house as all the main parties had contested separately and against each other.

Attacking the Centre for demonetisation, Mr Pawar said the November 8 move had resulted in massive losses in the farming sector and rural areas, besides job losses in the economy.

Questioning Mr Fadnavis's claims on the ""transparency agenda"", Mr Pawar demanded to know how the BJP could spend so much money on advertisements and publicity for the ongoing civic elections in Maharashtra.

Referring to a demand by the BJP to ban the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana Group of Publications for some days during the election period, Mr the NCP president said this indicated ""dictatorial"" attitude on the central government's part and expressed his opposition to it."

The 12 districts where polling is scheduled to begin at 7 am are Farrukhabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, Hardoi, Kannauj, Kanpur rural, Kanpur city, Unnao, Lucknow, Barabanki, Auraiyya and Sitapur.

Third phase of Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh slated for February 19
                                Campaigning for her party - the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Union minister Smriti Irani took on Priyanka Gandhi, whose brother and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has teamed up with the Samajwadi Party and Akhilesh Yadav for the ongoing Assembly elections in the state. Speaking about the people of Amethi, a key constituency for the Congress, Ms Irani said that Priyanka Gandhi is not campaigning here because she cannot face the people and their questions. Ms Irani, who was addressing a press conference in Amethi, said that despite losing the Lok Sabha election from Amethi in 2014 to Rahul Gandhi she has been working regularly for the people of the constituency.

Priyanka Gandhi, however, has been avoiding to campaign in Amethi because of ""unfulfilled promises,"" Ms Irani said, claiming that ""Priyanka (Gandhi) wants to avoid people's questions.""

Speaking about Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi forming a Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance in the state, Ms Irani said, ""(Chief Minister) Akhilesh Yadav went with Congress because he was not confident.""

When asked whether she would be the BJP's chief ministerial candidate if the party comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, Ms Irani evaded the question by saying that currently every BJP worker is focusing on the job at hand and wants to see the BJP win.

Speaking about the BSP and its chief Mayawati's recent comments targeting the BJP, Ms Irani said that Ms Mayawati just wants to ""remain in headlines"".

Uttar Pradesh, which is scheduled to vote in seven phases, has already finished the first two phases of polling. The third phase is scheduled for February 19. The counting of votes will take place on March 11."

""Buaji (Mayawati) is saying she will sit in the opposition if she is unable to form government. Elections are not over yet, but she is ready to sit in the opposition.

""She cannot be relied upon. She can join hands with anyone. She had celebrated 'Rakshabandhan' with a BJP leader earlier and she can do it in the future also,"" Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said at an election rally in Unnao.

His remarks came after the BSP chief said that she would rather be in the opposition than form an alliance with BJP to form the government in Uttar Pradesh and accused the BJP of spreading rumours of a coalition with BSP.

The chief minister also asked policemen to vote for him, stating that his government gave maximum promotions and made recruitments in the force.

He, however, cautioned policemen against taking bribe and said anyone accepting money from the people would be tracked if any complaint was received on ""Dial UP 100"" platform.

Mr Yadav also highlighted schemes launched by his government for the welfare of the people and sought their support in the election.

"Remove PM, Ministers' Photographs From Official Websites, Election Commission Tells Centre","http://www.ndtv.com/assembly/remove-pm-ministers-photographs-from-official-websites-election-commission-tells-centre-1659941","NEW DELHI:                             The Election Commission has ordered the Centre to remove photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers from government websites, insisting that all references to political leaders in official websites violated the model code of conduct.

Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha has also been told to explain why the central government hadn't removed references to the politicians from its websites so far.

The code of conduct had come into force from 4 January when the panel announced the schedule for elections to the five states, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur. The polls are already over in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa and two of the seven phases in Uttar Pradesh have been completed. Manipur will go to polls in March.

The EC letter sent over the weekend recalled that the commission had specifically mandated ""removal of all references of ministers, politician or political parties available on central/state government's official website"" in January.

It realised that the Centre hadn't complied with its instruction when someone complained how the website of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - that was being implemented in Uttar Pradesh - gave the BJP an unfair advantage since it had PM Narendra Modi and Union Housing Minister M Venkaiah Naidu's pictures.

The panel told the government to not only fix this website but also ""ensure that websites of other ministries/departments"" do not contain such photographs.

A key objective of the code is to ensure a level playing field for all political parties contesting elections and cap the possibility of the ruling party using government resources to its advantage.

Years ago, this meant taking down - or covering - government hoardings with pictures of the ministers.

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha General elections, the commission ordered the NDA government to mask pictures of then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on hoardings along the National Highways. Eight years later, the poll panel told the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh to drape the chief minister's statues, and of the elephants - that are her party, BSP's election symbol - at Ambedkar parks in Lucknow and Noida.

The same principle was later applied in cyber space, and the rule to remove all references to politicians from official websites introduced. In UP, many district officers have suspended their local websites rather than go through the trouble of scanning individual webpages."

SP has insulted Ram Manohar Lohia by forging alliance with Congress: PM
Fatehpur will vote on February 23 in the fourth phase of assembly polls
                                Prime Minster Narendra Modi on Sunday attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, accusing his Samajwadi Party government of politics of religion and caste discrimination. He was campaigning in Fatehpur, as UP voted in other parts of the state in the third of seven phases of the assembly elections.

""In Uttar Pradesh, everyone feels that they are being discriminated and they are being denied their rights,"" the Prime Minister said at an election rally. ""If a village has a graveyard it should also have a cremation ground. If there's electricity on Ramzan, it should also be there on Diwali. There must be bijli (power) both on Eid and Holi... There should be no discrimination,"" he said, accusing the Samajwadi Party of minority appeasement.

In Akhilesh Yadav's tenure, PM Modi said, ""The Dalits complain that their share is given to the Other Backward Classes, who in turn point a finger towards Muslims and Yadavs, while Yadavs say that only the family people get the benefits.""

The Prime Minister pitched schemes of the centre which, he said, benefit everyone irrespective of caste or religion and accused the state government of corruption. No one can get jobs without recommendations or the bribe, he said, urging people to elect the BJP for a change.

The BJP, which had swept Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 General Elections winning 71 of its 80 seats, is hoping to follow that up with as big a win in these assembly elections, it has not been in power in the state for the last 15 years. Instead of fielding a candidate for the Chief Minister's post, it has built its campaign around PM Modi's appeal and his development mantra.

"Manipur Elections 2017: Why Targeting The Young Voters Will Be Key","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-why-targeting-the-young-voters-will-be-key-1661599","Imphal:                             Campaigning is gaining momentum in Manipur, where the ruling Congress - which has been in power for 15 years - is locked in a battle for survival against the BJP which has made inroads in this Congress bastion. In all the 60 seats of Manipur, a key factor for winning will be who gets more votes of the youth and first time voters.

BJP's first star campaigner for Manipur, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, landed today and held whirlwind meetings before leaving for New Delhi. He predictably talked about the over 100 day-old economic blockade and the permanent peace agreement with NSCN(IM), the militant group that's currently on ceasefire mode.

More than hostilities, the Home Minister focused on creating avenues for the youth. Manipur, with nearly 80 per cent literacy levels, has a higher unemployment rate than the national average.

""We have taken a decision that we will provide loans to at minimum rate for those who are unemployed. I was surprised when I got to know that in the last 15 years there were 600 bandhs in the state. Even after having a stable government for so long why there were so many bandhs?"" Rajnath Singh said while releasing the vision document of the BJP in Imphal.

Manipur has over 19 lakh voters and 40 per cent of them are youth. More than 50 thousand are first time voters. Every political party wants to target the first timers.

And the entry of the Iron Lady Irom Sharmila, who's been fighting against tough military laws in the state, has made these elections a multi-cornered contest.

""I want to support sister Sharmila and her party because they are talking of clean politics, no matter if she wins or loses I will support her cause,"" said RK Bikramjit, Software Developer in Imphal.

In the hills of Manipur, young voters are key. ""Actually we all Nagas support NPF morally but I think the BJP is also strong,"" said Smith, a young voter from Senapati district in Manipur.

His friend Christina said: ""I was to change ... there is lot of corruption, this time around I want to change that.""

The popularity graph for the ruling Congress among young people in Manipur had been going down but in Ibobi Singh the Congress still has a chief ministerial candidate whom the youths are not writing off.

""There have been some issues with Ibobi rule, but there has been several good projects as well and that's why we are once again supporting him to become CM again,"" said Sudhir Singh, a young Congress supporter from Thoubal, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh's constituency where Irom Sharmila is taking on the three time Chief Minister.

If the Congress wants to reach the majority mark of 31 in the 60 member assembly, it surely needs the young voters who are being wooed by both the BJP and Irom Sharmila."

The court was taking note of allegations that appeals were being made by various political parties on the basis of religion.
    
The high court's Lucknow bench of justices Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Sanjay Harkauli gave the order on a PIL filed by local lawyer Ajmal Khan, seeking directions to curb any such inflammatory atmosphere in the ongoing Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

""Let the EC dwell on this matter and through its counsel assist this court as to what appropriate steps can be taken in this regard to curb any inflammatory atmosphere during the current electoral process,"" the court said yesterday in its order.

The petitioner alleged that the depictions and appeals being made by various political parties, their agents and speakers with the consent of their candidates on the basis of religion were causing immense damage and were in violation of provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

It is not in accordance with the philosophy of the Constitution and the mandate of the RP Act as well as the decision of the apex court in an earlier case, it observed.

""The utterances that have been brought on record through this petition and the public depiction thereof, if at all are correct, then it is high time that EC should intervene in the matter in order to curtail any such further depiction either by speakers, agents of political parties or candidates and, moreover, being repeated in a recycled manner depicted in the print and other forms of media including social media,"" the court observed.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had earlier complained to the EC about the lax in the security arrangements around the strong rooms. A party source said the officials, in charge, were allowing unauthorized people to the strong rooms.

Two incidents - one where people were seen entering the strong room in Ludhiana and another of EVM boxes being moved in Patiala - were referred to in the AAP complaints to the EC.   

The Congress and BJP leaders in Punjab have blamed the AAP leadership for creating panic over the issue.

"UP Elections 2017: Key To Owaisi's Expansion Plans For UP Is An 86-Year-Old In Sambhal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-in-one-part-of-state-owaisis-ambition-and-chances-rest-on-86-year-old-1659054","Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh: HighlightsAsaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM contests 40 seats in UP
Won no seats in Bihar in 2015
In Sambhal, has appropriated famous 86-year-old Barq Sahib
                                Well past midnight, a large crowd has gathered inside a marriage hall to witness the oratorical prowess of 86-year-old Shafiqur Rehman Barq, who echoes the radicalism of Asaduddin Owaisi, chief of the All India Majlis-e Ittahadul Muslimeen or AIMIM.

For the first time, the party is contesting 40 seats in Uttar Pradesh - in the last state election five years ago, it did not participate. The quantum leap reflects Asaduddin Owaisi's ambition to turn his outfit into a national party with power extending far beyond its traditional reach of Telangana.

Shafiqur Rehman Barq is not the candidate from Sambhal, where Muslims form more than 65 per cent of the population. But for decades, he has been the area's undisputed political overlord, representing it both in parliament and in the state legislature. A four-time Lok Sabha member, he began his career with the Samajwadi Party: ""I was there when Mulayam Singh laid its foundation."" In the 2009 general elections, he left Mulayam Singh, who did not choose him as a candidate, and successfully ran for parliament from Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party. In 2014, he switched back, but lost his bid by just 5,000 votes. ""I was betrayed by my own party,"" he says, alleging that a political rival, Iqbal Mehmood, worked to ensure his defeat.
 UP Elections: Iqbal Mehmood is Samajwadi Party's candidate and the incumbent legislator of Sambhal.Iqbal Mehmood's father fought two elections against Mr Barq, losing one and winning the other. In January, Shafiqur Rehman Barq continued his tradition of political road-crossing to join Mr Owaisi, whose father he knew well. ""Salahuddin Owaisi was with me when I was the convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, so when his son Owaisi called me and said, 'Uncle, work with us, I had to."" Part of the agreement was that the AIMIM's candidate would be his grandson, Zia-ur-Rahman.

On Wednesday, when Uttar Pradesh decides 63 seats, he will run against Iqbal Mehmood, who is Mulayam Singh's candidate and the incumbent legislator.

In 2014, the AIMIM, in its first foray outside Telengana, won two assembly seats in Maharashtra, a windfall for a small party. This success spurred Asaduddin Owaisi's ambition to form a pan-Indian party representing Muslims. But the hype was considerably dampened by the AIMIM's poor showing in Bihar in 2015, where it failed to win a single seat.

It has never contested the UP elections earlier. Its best chance lies in Sambhal and in the support of Shafiqur Rehman Barq.
 Shafiqur Rehman Barq has represented Sambhal both in parliament and state legislatureAt his kothi (bungalow), Iqbal Mehmood, who is in his 60s, is confident that the ""AIMIM is going to be driven out of Sambhal and out of UP. People here, at heart are Samajwadi...Barq only wins when the Samajwadi Party gives him a ticket, but this time, both the people and the party are with me.""

This old rivalry literally partitions Sambhal in two. A shopkeeper near the historic Jama Masjid likened this to the divide between India and Pakistan. Mohallas or neighbourhoods have marked preferences between the two. This makes for a volatile political culture, where election time drives people into frenetic activity, with political processions spilling onto the streets late into the night and groups gathering at home to discuss each day's developments.

""But people are tired of these two men, their rivalry. One is a Nawab (an aristocrat) who is facing anti-incumbency, the other is on a ticket from a party that is Hyderabadi,"" asserts the Muslim candidate from Mayawati's party, Rafatullah, known locally as Neta Chedi. Sambhal has about 40,000 Dalits, predominantly Jatavs, who are Mayawati's main support group; he's hoping that the Dalit-Muslim combine that she has stressed in her campaign will see him through.  Mayawati's rallies in Western UP close to its dates of polling have helped the BSP gain traction.

But in the endless identity arithmetic of Sambhal, Rafatalluah further points to a further subset, and claims that his community of Bovne Turks will vote for him, and not Shafiqur Rehman Barq, who is a Khoje Turk. Turk Muslims, who claim their descent from Mahmood Ghaznavi, are the largest of Sambhal's Muslim community, and are divided into two distinct groups - Khoje and Bovne (the former are the larger group in Sambhal).

This battle between three Muslim candidates, and the possibility of their fractioning the vote among them, has given the BJP the rare hope of winning a Muslim-dominated seat. Its candidate, Arvind Gupta, is a respected and gentle doctor, who is hoping that his personal rapport with the small town will win a portion of the Muslim vote. ""It's true Muslims do not vote for the BJP, but my family and I have a good equation with Muslim families. They are my patients and I am sure they will look beyond the party and vote for me,"" he said.

Sajan Goel, who owns a Mentha factory, Sambhal's only real industry, says that Dr Gupta is the best bet for Sambhal. ""We used to vote the Samajwadi Party into power, but there's been little development since Sambhal became a district. Muslims should unite with us. Forget the party and remember Dr Arvind is a good man,"" he urged.

This is at best a faint hope. Dr Arvind is simply from the wrong party. At a political meeting, this one within the zenana (women's quarters) - purdah is very strictly observed by the Turk Muslims-Shahana tells us ""Dr Arvind is a good man, we like him, but how can we vote for him when his party goes after Muslims? BJP leaders talk of putting us under curfew. We will vote for Barq Sahibas has always spoken in the interest of Muslims,"" she said.

The fact of multiple Muslim candidates vying to emerge as the protector of the community is typical of the Muslim constituencies of this region and Shafiqur Rehman Barq is a past master at this game. People still remember his walkout from the parliament in 2013 to protest the singing of Vande Mataram, a patriotic song described as non-secular by leaders like him and Owaisi said. Even in Chaman Sarai, a locality which is a Samajwadi stronghold, a meat shop owner says, ""Barqsahib is the one to raise Muslim issues in parliament. At a time when gaurakshaks (cow vigilantes) are going after us, he is the best option.""

The AIMIM is riding on voices like these. For Barq, a charged election campaign strengthens his appeal as the combative leader of the Muslims against the perceived threat of the Hindu right.  Owaisi's own radical rhetoric attracted a large crowd at a rally last week in the heart of Sambal.  

But similar large crowds in Bihar did not translate into votes, and the Samajwadi countered with an impressive Akhilesh Yadav rally just three days later."

The two leaders at a press conference released the commitments which include major promises made by the two parties to the people of the state in their manifestos.

The list of commitments include distribution of free smartphones to youth, employment guarantee through skill development to 20 lakh youths, loan waiver to farmers, cheap power and proper remuneration for crops.

It also commits to provide Rs 1,000 monthly pension to one crore poor families and one time food at Rs 10 to urban poor, 33 per cent reservation to women in government jobs and 50 per cent reservation in panchayat and local bodies elections besides power, road and water to every village in five years.

Free cycles to all girl students of class IX to XII and meritorious students, free homes to over 10 lakh poor dalit and backward families, four lane roads connecting all districts and metro in six main cities also figure in the list.

For the minorities and backwards, it promises representation in ratio to their population in all the welfare schemes as also police modernisation for making it more effective and phased expansion of dial-100 scheme.

These commitments include the promises made by Rahul Gandhi during his state-wide Kisan Yatra, such as loan waiver to farmers and reduction of power tariff for them - a long time demand of Congress.

""At least Samajwadi people practically give shape to what they say but some others only do 'mann ki baat' but 'kaam ki baat nahi karte'... they do not say in rallies and in districts what are the achievements of their government,"" Mr Yadav said.

""(They say) two families have entered into an alliance... I will say that two youths have come together it is an alliance of SP and Congress...,"" he stressed in response to a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comment in this regard.

""These are ten steps to development worked out by the two parties on which Congress and SP will work on coming to power in future,"" Mr Yadav added."
"Manipur Elections 2017: Irom Sharmila On BJP's Offer, Arvind Kejriwal's Advice","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-irom-sharmila-on-bjps-offer-arvind-kejriwals-advice-1658250","Thoubal, Manipur:                             Manipur's famous human rights crusader Irom Chanu Sharmila is busy these days campaigning in Thoubal - the assembly constituency that three-time Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh of the Congress represents. Ms Sharmila, 44, who recently launched her political party Peoples' Resurgence And Justice Alliance (PRAJA), is contesting against the 68-year-old Chief Minister.

NDTV caught up with Ms Sharmila during her campaign as she spoke at length on why she is taking a plunge into politics, why she turned down an offer from the BJP and also her take on the economic blockade that has paralysed the state.

NDTV: You have given up your hunger strike and said that now the fight will be taken up politically and you want to take it right inside the legislative assembly. How has the journey into politics been so far?

Irom Sharmila: People's reaction is mixed. They come to realise the real being of me. They come to know about my sense of humanity. Here in Thoubal, I am sitting and discussing with the local community. They are happy about my new step. They all want to see a change and they are fed up of the three terms of the Congress.

NDTV: You want to bring change and a new social order in Manipur. The BJP is also talking of change. What is your opinion on the BJP?

Irom Sharmila: I was approached by the BJP to fight on their ticket in this election. Their suggestion was that to fight Ibobi, I will need 36 crores. If I have it, I should produce it, if not the centre would sanction it. On that condition, I said I will stand for elections as an independent. I don't criticise other political parties. I just want to bring a change in the society. I want to bring the right to justice to all and ensure that the draconian AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) is withdrawn.

NDTV: Before you launched your political party - PRAJA - you had met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and many in Manipur are now saying that you are trying to repeat what Mr Kejriwal did in Delhi. What was his tip for you?

Irom Sharmila: He just wanted me to be successful in bringing real democracy in the society and wanted me to connect with people and he gave brotherly advice.

NDTV: The economic blockade has overshadowed the poll. Does it seems there is any solution?

Irom Sharmila: Right now, the solution is not visible. Our government is benefiting from the blockade politically and until and unless there is a change, things will be the same."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Campaign Ends For Phase-2","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-campaign-ends-for-phase-2-1659079","Lucknow:                             Political parties paused campaigning in close to 67 constituencies of western Uttar Pradesh figuring in the second phase of the seven-phase Assembly election in the state on February 15.

The constituencies are spread across 11 districts -- Saharanpur, Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal, Rampur, Bareilly, Amroha, Pilibhit, Kheri, Shahjahanpur and Badaun.

Of the 67 seats at stake, ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) had won 34 in 2012, followed by BSP 18, BJP 10, Congress 3 and others 2.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah championed the cause of the saffron party during the campaigning, the SP-Congress alliance's charge was spearheaded by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, besides other leaders of the respective parties.

BSP chief Mayawati wooed the voters addressing one rally after another all by herself, with senior party leader SC Misra chipping in at certain places.

Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah slammed the Congress and SP, saying Rahul Gandhi ran a campaign against the SP government and wondered what change of heart made them embrace each other now.

Mr Yadav and Mr Gandhi harped on demonetisation, alleging that PM Modi's notes ban decision had caused immense hardship to those living in the rural areas.

Keeping in mind that western Uttar Pradesh had vast tracts of agricultural land, PM Modi played the pro-poor and pro-farmers card and reiterated BJP's promise of waiving loans of small and marginal farmers and paying the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.

Interestingly, political bigwigs, including SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav and Congress president Sonia Gandhi were conspicuous by their absence from the campaign trail in the first two phases of polling."

A total of 839 candidates - including the key parties of BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance as well as the Rashtriya Lok Dal and independents - will contest the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts of western Uttar Pradesh.

With 26 contestants, Agra South will see the maximum number of candidates while Hastinapur will the least number of candidates - six.

According to the Association for Democratic Reforms, approximately 40 per cent of the BJP candidates in phase-1 have declared criminal cases against them, the most, followed by the BSP with a close 39 per cent. The SP-Congress alliance has 28 per cent candidates with criminal cases whereas the RLD has 33 per cent such candidates in the first phase.

Elaborate security arrangements have been made in all districts. Of the 887 polling centres in Muzaffarnagar, 600 have been instilled with video cameras. Around 6,000 paramilitary personnel are also being deployed in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts.

While the SP hopes to retain power - albeit with the Congress this time, the BJP and BSP hope to regain power in the state after 13 and five years, respectively.

The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 Union elections, decimating the Congress, SP and BSP - which were reduced to five, two and zero seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The election in Uttar Pradesh - along with those in Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand - is considered to be a referendum on Mr Modi's demonetisation drive. In his campaigns across Uttar Pradesh, Mr Modi urged voters to root out 'SCAM' - an acronym for Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.

Ms Mayawati is expected to be a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, should the BSP win. Her party was the worst sufferer in the state in the 2014 Union elections as it failed to register a single seat. This time, the party has fielded a record number of candidates belonging to the Muslim community, considered to be a key vote bank for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.

The poll is also a crucial test for the new national president of Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, who gained control of the party after a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister has forged an alliance with the Congress and lately, Rahul Gandhi and Mr Yadav have been jointly campaigning all over Uttar Pradesh. The Congress will contest 24 seats whereas the Samajwadi Party has given tickets to 51 contestants in the first-phase.

Among the 2.6 crore people eligible voters, around 1.4 crore are male, 1.2 crore are female whereas there are a little over 1,500 voters from the third gender.

Attacking Samajwadi Party, the BSP chief assured the voters that she would rid the state of ""prevailing jungle raj"" by putting criminals behind bars and urged Muslims not to waste their votes on SP. ""The first phase of UP polls was encouraging for BSP. It was a clean sweep for our party. It's a positive signal that we are going to form government in the state,"" she told an election rally Sitapur.

On SP-Congress alliance, she said, ""It is political opportunism as Congress joined hands with a government which works on BJP's guidelines.""

""Samajwadi government only gave lawlessness and corruption with over 500 riots,"" she claimed, adding voters of SP are divided in two factions now.

""Shivpal Yadav will damage SP because he was insulted by Mulayam Singh due to his affection for son Akhilesh,"" Ms Mayawati said and appealed to minority voters not to support SP.

On BJP, Ms Mayawati claimed demonetisation was a painful decision for 90 per cent farmers, workers and the poor and Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured only the capitalists and the rich.

She charged the Prime Minister with working under RSS directives.

Ms Mayawati recalled the suicide of dalit student Rohit Vemula at Hyderabad Central University and the assault on dalits who allegedly skinned a dead cow in Una in Gujarat, warning that such incidents would happen in Uttar Pradesh if BJP came to power.

She dubbed as ""fake"" the surveys and opinion polls that said BSP will not come to power and said that they will be proved wrong as in 2007, when her party got majority.

""You should not believe in such surveys. If BSP came to power all development schemes will be restarted and names of schemes and places that were changed will be restored,"" she said.

""Employment will be given to young men and women instead of laptops and phones,"" she said, asking minority voters to help BSP get majority in the elections."

In reply to a question, Mr Sisodia said that his party will welcome all leaders, including rebels from other political parties, to its fold if they are not corrupt, and have clean characters.

Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he claimed that because of demonetisation, trade, industry and the common man have suffered heavily. ""Those in possession of black money got their money exchanged from back doors, while the aam aadmi, like the farmers and the labourers, had to stand in queues to withdraw their own hard earned money,"" Mr Sisodia said.

Mr Sisodia, claimed the AAP government in Delhi has accelerated development, reduced power tariff and improved the education sector.

"Uttar Pradesh Election 2017: Key Candidates Contesting","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-election-2017-key-candidates-contesting-1658252","New Delhi:                             The first phase of the crucial seven-phase Uttar Pradesh assembly elections will take place today. The fate of the key parties - BJP, Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance, and the Bahujan Samaj Party - will be decided today in 73 constituencies of western Uttar Pradesh, including Noida, Shamli, Ghaziabad and Meerut.

While the Bahujan Samaj Party, led by Ms Mayawati, will seek to regain power in the state after five years, the BJP hopes to replicate its 2014 success - when it won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the Union elections. The election is a big test for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who gained control of the Samajwadi Party after a bitter feud with father Mulayam Singh and uncle Shivpal Yadav. It has forged an alliance with the Congress for the polls.

Many say the outcome Uttar Pradesh polls will create the roadmap for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

"Uttarakhand Election 2017: 68% Overall Voter Turnout In 69 Assembly Constituencies As Voting Ends","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-election-live-voting-begins-in-69-assembly-constituencies-1659585","Dehradun:                             Voting has ended in Uttarakhand's 69 constituencies spread across 13 districts (7 in Garhwal region and the remaining 6 in Kumaon region of the state). Residents of Uttarakhand voted today to decide who will form the next government in the state. The overall voter turnout was 68%, which is 1.2% higher than the 2012 Assembly election (66.8%). The BJP is hoping to unseat the ruling Congress government of Chief Minister Harish Rawat, which is battling corruption charges. Out of a total of 70 constituencies, 69 have voted today and 1 constituency - Karnaprayag will vote on March 9 because of the untimely death of BSP candidate Kuldeep Singh Kanwasi, who met with a fatal accident recently. Karnaprayag is a high profile constituency from where Deputy Speaker of the state assembly Anusuya Prasad Maikhuri is contesting. The security level across the hill state had been heightened, especially along the border with Nepal. Anti-incumbency has always been a factor in Uttarakhand, which has voted out the government in power at the time, in successive elections since its formation. Chief Minister Harish Rawat contested from Haridwar Rural in Garhwal against sitting BJP legislator Swami Yatishwaranand, banking on the Muslim and Dalit voters in the city that is one of the largest pilgrim centres of the country. The BJP has accused the Congress of turning ""Dev Bhoomi"" Uttarakhand, meaning the land of Gods to ""Loot Bhoomi"" - the land of corruption. For Chief Minister Rawat, the battle was seen as uphill and he also contested from Kichcha in Kumaon. The Congress had portrayed this as his attempt to reaffirm the party's commitment to both Kumaon and Garhwal. His detractors saw this as a last-ditch attempt to save the party in seats where up to 12 leaders have defected, leading to instability and a loss of face for the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged people of Uttarakhand to come out and vote in large numbers. A high voter turnout would indicate a change in government. In 2012, Uttarakhand saw a voter turnout of 67.22 per cent. Uttarakhand voted in a single phase. Counting of votes will take place on March 11.

Harish Rawat: I am a small man and I am the Chief Minister of a small state... some of the things he (PM Narendra Modi) has said have been ill-advised and do not give him or his office the respect it deserves.

"Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi's Claim Of Secularism Exposed","http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/akhilesh-yadav-rahul-gandhis-claim-of-secularism-exposed-1658995","In a prescient foreword to late politician and writer Rafiq Zakaria's book Communal Rage in Secular India, nobel laureate Amartya Sen had a thought-provoking paragraph analyzing communal riots in India. He wrote ""Everyone has many identities, related not just to one's religion and community, but also to class, occupation, language, gender, political inclinations, and so on. When I was growing up in Bengal in the bloody 1940's, I remember being struck - even as a child - by the fact that the victims of the riots overwhelmingly came from the same class, even when they belonged to different communities or religious groups."" The book in concern was Rafiq Zakaria's much lauded analysis of the Gujarat riots of 2002. A riot which has been much dissected like the 1984 riots, with the victims awaiting justice.

Circa 2017, one of the country's most politically significant states, Uttar Pradesh, is now voting and the undercurrent amidst the development cacophony is clearly religious and caste-based polarization. I am writing this column days after the most polarized districts of Western UP like Muzaffarnagar and Shamli have cast their vote because the purpose of this column was not to influence the voter but to put on display the shameful apathy of our so-called secular leaders.
 The Samajwadi Party and Congress are contesting the UP polls as an allianceTwo days before voting in  Muzaffarnagar, a district which witnessed one of the worst communal riots in the last decade, Amnesty India released a press note which was significant. Among other things which pointed to a lax attitude of the Akhilesh Yadav administration towards the Muzaffarnagar victims, it said, ""The Uttar Pradesh government has failed to expeditiously investigate and prosecute the seven cases of gang-rape filed after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and deliver justice...Over three years after the riots, there has not been a single conviction in any of the cases. Despite changes to India's laws in 2013 requiring trials in rape cases to be completed without unnecessary delay, trials have proceeded extremely slowly. The state government and successive central governments have also failed to adequately protect the survivors from threats and harassment - which in some cases led to them retracting their statements - and to provide adequate reparation.""

Yet, as UP votes, neither the Congress, which is an ally of the Samajwadi Party, nor the Lalu Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal which has been vocal in its support of the Akhilesh government in the last five years, questioned the Chief Minister for his inability to administer justice. It is important to remember that these are the same leaders who demanded justice from Narendra Modi for the 2002 victims in the name of secularism. 

In 2013, when the Muzaffarnagar riots displaced at least 50,000 people and took 62 lives, it was Akhilesh Yadav who was the Chief Minister of the state. Yes, the riots polarized Uttar Pradesh and helped  the BJP with a landslide victory in the general election the next year. But does that give Akhilesh Yadav the right to be indifferent to those seeking justice, especially the women who were raped and are now pleading for justice in courts? Like Modi who was the chief Minister of Gujarat when the riots killed at least thousand and landed families in relief camps, Akhilesh too could do little to stop the killings and rapes in Muzaffarnagar.
 Communal riots tore through the western Uttar Pradesh town of Muzaffarnagar in 2013, leaving more than 60 people dead and thousands homelessAs I travelled through Baghra, Budhana and Jansath tehsils in Muzaffarnagar, where Muslims form roughly 45 percent of the population, I met people who were scared at the prospect of the election. They feared that with BJP leaders including party president Amit Shah bringing  up the Ayodhya issue and the alleged Hindu exodus from Kairana, there could be a return of communal tension in the state. They feared for their women and children, but had nowhere to go.  

More appalling was the fact that the very people who were most affected during the Muzaffarnagar riots, who had lost their property, were willing to give Akhilesh Yadav another chance as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. And they had their reasons. First, they believed that Mayawati had chosen to ignore their plight and shown no interest in getting them justice. Some believed that in the case of a fractured majority, Mayawati could help the BJP return to power, as opposed to Akhilesh Yadav, who had allied with the Congress. Their primary interest in supporting the Chief Minister who sat through their plight was to stop the BJP from assuming power, as it was the BJP which allegedly instigated and benefited from the riots. Akhilesh Yadav, who took on his father by his own confession to clear the Samajwadi Party of thuggery, has shown a weak spine when it comes to justice for the women in his state, whose stories of abuse silence Akhilesh Yadav's tall claims of inclusiveness. That the Muzaffarnagar victims are willing to give him a chance only to keep the BJP at bay should be a source of tremendous embarrassment to Akhilesh Yadav, who is spinning the cycle of secularism"" in Uttar Pradesh and looking to return to power. To quote from the Amnesty report again: ""In three cases, survivors identified and named the men they said had raped them in their First Information Reports, but then retracted their statements in court. Some of them later admitted that they had been compelled to do so after facing pressure and threats to their safety and that of their families, and a lack of adequate support and security from the authorities.""
 BSP chief Mayawati has traditionally done well in Western Uttar Pradesh These documents are part of the public domain, like many others which highlight the plight of the women and displaced children of Muzaffarnagar, and it is highly unlikely that both Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav are not privy to them. So when both leaders who are looking at a possible assembly victory as their big ticket for 2019, look the other way while campaigning in Uttar Pradesh, how different are they from those they slot as the epitome of communalism, like Modi and Shah? 

In a month's time, Uttar Pradesh will have a new government, and irrespective of who assumes power, Akhilesh Yadav will have to carry the baggage of being an inefficient leader to the victims of Muzaffarnagar. And his political rivals could tell him that it is not moral baggage that's easy to live with.

Irom Sharmila, the feisty activist of Manipur, who recently launched her party PRAJA or the Peoples Resurgence and Justice Alliance, dropped her hat in the poll ring to take the fight against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA politically and is contesting against three-time Chief Minister of the Congress.

""The local communities are happy and positive about my new step. They want to see change and they are fed up of the Congress,"" said Ms Sharmila.

Unlike for Mr Singh, Thoubal is not her home, but many have warmed up to her egalitarian ways. Wider public sentiment, however, still remains divided between the leaders.

Supporters of Ms Sharmila look at her as someone capable of ushering in change, while those on Mr Singh's side are confident that he will win.

""Ibobi Singh has won several times. But now with Sharmila, we feel there can be a real change. With her fight against AFSPA in the assembly, the situation might improve,"" said a local voter Kamala Devi.

""We have heard about three candidates but it is Ibobi Singh who is going to win,"" said Thoubal resident Ashok Singh.

After Ms Sharmila ended her 16-year-long fast in protest against alleged army atrocities in Manipur, she had vowed to continue her crusade politically.

Then, she had received both flak and praise for her move to end the fast, but she chose to embark on the journey undeterred. People from her party also believe that her style of campaign is quite ""unlike the regular netas"".

""The down-to-earth leader went around her constituency, met people and heard about their issues,"" said James Mayengbam, one of the top functionaries of PRAJA."

"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: In Noida, Many Find Their Names Missing From Voters List","http://www.ndtv.com/noida-news/in-noida-many-find-their-names-missing-from-voters-list-1658457","Noida:                             There was evident enthusiasm among voters in Noida which went to the polls in the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, but many felt disappointed after finding their names missing from the voters list.

The constituency abutting Delhi recorded a voter turnout of 58.18 percent.

The triangular contest here is between BJP's Pankaj Singh, the son of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Samajwadi Party's Sunil Choudhary and Bahujan Samaj Party's Ravikant Mishra.

Sabhajit Yadav, an auto driver who lives in Sector 8, said he was very disappointed on not finding his name in the voters list.

""My name was missing from the list. An Anganwadi worker came to my house to get the names verified. But when I went to cast my vote, they said my name was not in the Election Commission record,"" Yadav told IANS.

""We have been living here for more than 30 years. How is it possible that my name is not there on the list while my daughter's and my wife's names are there,"" he added.

A polling agent of Samajwadi Party in Sector 11 said there were complaints from a large number of people about their names being missing. An agent of the BJP in the area also seconded him.

Richa Bala, who came to the polling booth at Ghijor village, said that she had voted in the 2014 Lok Sabha election but was unable do so in this election.

Bala's friend, who was accompanying her, said she had called the prescribed toll number to lodge a complaint and got to know that 2,000 such complaints had already been made.

Lalita, who runs a shop at Ghijor village, also rued that she could not vote.

""I have been casting my vote here for the past 25 years. This time my name is missing from the list. My husband's name is there, but not mine,"" she said.

A booth level officer at Ghijor said they could not help those whose names were missing.

""If a person's name is there at multiple places, it gets deleted. People have to take care that they are properly registered at one address only,"" he said.

Contacted, Kumar Vineet, Additional District Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the list was publicised many times.

He said people whose names are missing might not have checked the list.

""There could be many reasons. They should have verified their names in the voters list before the elections,"" Vineet told IANS.

Some voters did not hesitate to express their preferences.

""BJP is in power at the Centre. If they come to power in the state, there will be development here as well. Law and order situation is not good in Uttar Pradesh,"" said Rakesh Bhandari, a resident of Sector 11, who works in a telecom office.

""I think there is a contest between the BSP and BJP,"" he added.

Another voter, Kailash Mandal, a resident of Sector 17, said: ""It is a contest between Samajwadi Party and BJP here in Noida. The BSP is a bit down.""

""There is hope that Sunil Choudhury will win. He is an old candidate from Noida. With BSP contesting this time, BJP will lose votes,"" Mandal added.

"PM Narendra Modi's Speech In Shrinagar In Uttarakhand's Garhwal Region Ahead Of Assembly Elections: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-pm-narendra-modis-speech-in-srinagar-in-uttarakhands-garhwal-region-ahead-of-assembly-elections-1658531","Dehradun:                             Ahead of the Assembly election  in the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally today in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region. Speaking to the people from the GITI ground in Garhwal's Shrinagar town, Prime Minister Modi focused on the BJP's promise of development for the hill state. The Prime Minister also spoke about his government's efforts at the Centre to remove black money and curb corruption - one of the key issues ahead of elections in Uttarakhand. His Garhwal rally comes weeks after he laid the foundation for the 900-Km Char Dham highway project in the state's capital Dehradun. The highway - a 12,000-crore-rupee project - is an all-weather road aimed at improving connectivity between Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. During the launch of the project, the PM had said that the highway will put Uttarakhand's economy, which is dependent on tourism - particularly religious toruism, back on track. It will also help create jobs and people will not have to move out of the state to get employment, he had said. Last week, the Prime Minister had targeted the Congress - which is the incumbent government in Uttarakhand - and criticised its Vice President Rahul Gandhi in Parliament over the situation in the hill state. The PM took a dig at Mr Gandhi, saying, ""the earthquake finally did happen."" The PM was referring to Mr Gandhi's claim, offered in December, that the government was preventing him from speaking in Parliament on the notes ban issue, because if he was allowed to share his remarks, ""an earthquake will happen."" Uttarakhand was hit by a 5.8 magnitude earthquake on February 6, tremors of which, were felt in Delhi too. Mr Gandhi had recently said ""SCAM"", when applied to his party's actions, refers to ""Seva, Courage, Ability and Modesty."" The PM said that the attempt to ""find Seva (service) in Scam"" so distressed ""Mother Earth"" that an earthquake was the result. Uttarakhand will vote in a single phase on February 15, and counting of votes will happen on March 11.

Here are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech at Shrinagar in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region:The current Chief Minister is a person who does not love his state. Can such a person do any good for you all?During the discussion to make Uttarakhand a separate state, they were against it.It is because of them that development has come to a grinding halt in Uttarakhand.Not just in terms of development, they score low on every issue. They have not been able to ensure the safety of women in the state.This election will be a make or break election for the state. Your fate is in your hands. choose wisely.Among all the other Himalayan states, Uttarakhand lags behind despite tremendous potential. Go to Sikkim and see the difference. More than 20 lakh tourists visited the state.But that is not the case in Uttarakhand. Tourists and pilgrims want to visit 'dev bhoomi' (God's land) Uttarakhand, but cannot do so because of poor infrastructure and facilities in the state.Tourism is key for Uttarakhand, and infrastructure must be given a boost. That will boost the economy of the state and create jobs.Roads in Uttarakhand are in a terrible condition. We are doing our bit from the Centre by giving Rs. 12,000 crore for an all-weather road - The Char Dham highway - which will benefit you all immensely. We would like to do much more for you all - even at the state level, but that can only happen if you vote for the BJP. We know our responsibilities, unlike the current government.Uttarakhand has tremendous potential and talent. It even has a rich history. Today, people around the world are seeing the benefits of Yoga. When we talk of Yoga, Haridwar automatically comes to mind.The soil in Uttarakhand is fertile. The state has a rich ecology. Almost every plant that grows here has some medicinal or healing value. Uttarakhand also has a big asset - water. Lots can be done even in this regard. The Panchmeshwar project will help solve many problems in the state.Many soldiers in our armed forces come from Uttarakhand. We are proud of them. But the Congress - they sat on 'One Rank One Pension' for years. For us it was a priority, and you all can see, we did it. We cleared the bill soon after being voted to power.Another top priority for us is to root out black money and corruption. But you all saw the state the country was in till a few years ago. During UPA, black money and corruption were in symphony. There was no intent or effort by them to take any action against the social menace. But then the BJP came, and we brought demonetisation, which shook corruption at its very root. It was a big step towards eradicating black money, which has eaten our system hollow. But they still blame me and abuse me. But don't worry, I can tolerate anything for the benefit of my poor brothers and sisters.Today, you stand at a point where you must choose by way of vote. Vote for a brighter future. Vote for development. Vote for progress.This 'chaiwala' (tea seller) is with you all, and always will be. Together we will win our fight against black money and corruption. My fight will always be for the poor."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Minister Allegedly Threatens To Set Journalist On Fire","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-minister-allegedly-threatens-to-set-journalist-on-fire-1658477","Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh:                             Uttar Pradesh Minister Radhey Shyam Singh allegedly threatened to set a local journalist on fire for not supporting him during the ongoing Assembly elections in the state. Mr Singh of the ruling Samajwadi Party denies the claim.

The journalist has filed a complaint with the police and has handed over the mobile audio of the alleged threat to the Superintendent of Police, Kushinagar, Raju Babu Singh. Mr Singh said he had received the complaint and the matter would be investigated.

In the past too, the minister has been accused of abusing and threatening local government officials over phone.

Earlier, another Uttar Pradesh Minister, Ram Murti Singh Verma, was booked along with five others in connection with the killing of a journalist Jagendra Singh by allegedly setting him on fire in Shahjahanpur district in June 2015. He had made a Facebook post against the minister regarding his alleged involvement in illegal sand mining and land grabbing.

"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: All Major Parties Claim They Swept The First Phase","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-all-major-parties-claim-they-swept-the-first-phase-1658712","Lucknow:                             A day after the first phase of polling, major parties in Uttar Pradesh claimed that they have swept the round and were on the road to form government in the politically crucial state.

Samajwadi Party party chief Akhilesh Yadav said that the downfall of those who had ""befooled"" the people promising ""achche din"" has started while Mayawati asserted that she will prove pollsters wrong as she did in 2007 when they predicted her defeat.

BJP Chief Amit Shah claimed 'achhe din' will come in Uttar Pradesh after counting of votes on March 11.

Claiming that SP was ahead of rivals in the first phase, Akhilesh said the trend will continue and the alliance will get majority.

""We could have got majority alone, but after alliance with Congress we will comfortably win over 300 seats,"" Akhilesh said in Badaun.

""The downfall of those who had befooled people promising 'achche din' has started. After 2017, they will be wiped out in 2019 also. They (BJP) should tell as to what have they done for people,"" he said.

Addressing a rally in Sitapur, Mayawati claimed it was a ""clean sweep"" for BSP in the first phase.

""The first phase of UP polls was encouraging for BSP. It was a clean sweep for our party. It's a positive signal that we are going to form government in the state,"" she told an election rally here.

She dubbed as ""fake"" the surveys and opinion polls that said BSP will not come to power and said that they will be proved wrong as in 2007, when her party got majority.

""You should not believe in such surveys. If BSP came to power all development schemes will be restarted and names of schemes and places that were changed will be restored,"" she said.

Mr Shah said BSP is the main rival from BJP in first two phases of Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls and Samajwadi Party in the rest five.

""As per the trend of first phase, we will get more than 50 seats (out of 73). In the first two phases we will be getting more than 90 seats (out of total 140). The main rival in these two phases is BSP. In the next phases, the rival will be SP,"" Mr Shah told reporters in Lucknow.

He claimed that issues like payment of cane dues, loans at zero per cent interest to farmers, anti-Romeo squads to check crime against women, and some other key points in BJP manifesto had attracted youths and common people and they were supporting BJP.

Slamming Akhilesh, Mr Shah said he has conceded defeat by sacrificing 105 (of the 403) seats to Congress.

On the chief minister's charge that 'acche din' have eluded the people, he said, ""By saying this, Akhilesh has accepted that he has failed. After ruling for five years, he is asking when will 'acche din' come. It will come after March 11, when BJP will form government.""

The first phase of UP polls in 73 assembly constituencies witnessed 64.22 per cent voter turnout yesterday. Voting will be held in 67 Assembly constituencies spread over 11 districts on February 15.

The other five phases will be held on February 19, 23 and 27 and on March 4 and 8.

Counting will be taken up on March 11."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017 Live: Polling Closes For The State's Polls' First Phase","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-elections-live-first-phase-of-voting-begins-in-uttar-pradesh-today-1658261","The first phase of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections took place today in the key constituencies of Mathura, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Noida, among others. The first-phase election in India's largest state is an intense, high-octane three way contest between the BJP, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance. While the SP hopes to retain power - albeit with the Congress this time, the BJP and BSP hope to regain power in the state after 13 and five years, respectively.

The BJP won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 Union elections, decimating the Congress, SP and BSP - which were reduced to five, two and zero seats in the Lok Sabha elections. The election in Uttar Pradesh - along with those in Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand - is considered to be a referendum on PM Modi's demonetisation drive. In his campaigns across Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi urged voters to root out 'SCAM' - an acronym for Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.

Ms Mayawati is expected to be a five-time Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, should the BSP win. Her party was the worst sufferer in the state in the 2014 Union elections as it failed to register a single seat. This time, the party has fielded a record number of candidates belonging to the Muslim community, considered to be a key vote bank for the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.

The poll is also a crucial test for the new national president of Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, who gained control of the party after a bitter feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister has forged an alliance with the Congress and lately, Rahul Gandhi and Mr Yadav have been jointly campaigning all over Uttar Pradesh. The Congress will contest 24 seats whereas the Samajwadi Party has given tickets to 51 contestants in the first-phase.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an incumbent Lok Sabha member from Varanasi whereas Congress' top leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are parliamentarians from Raebareli and Amethi, respectively.

"UP Elections 2017: Mulayam Singh Yadav's First Election Rally is Today. For Brother Shivpal Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-mulayams-first-election-rally-it-is-for-shivpal-1658294","JASWANTNAGAR: HighlightsMulayam Singh Yadav to address rally in his brother's constituency
He is also slated to speak at a rally for daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav
First rally after his son Akhilesh Yadav took over the reins of the party
                                When Samajwadi Party mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav gets up to speak at a rally in Takha, his brother Shivpal Yadav's assembly constituency Jaswantnagar this afternoon, it will be the first, and probably one of the two election rallies he will address over the next few days. The other rally, is slated for his younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, in the Lucknow cantonment seat in Uttar Pradesh's Capital.

This will also be Mulayam's first election rally after a number of flip-flops on whether he would campaign for the Samajwadi Party after his son Akhilesh Yadav took over the reins of the party. Today's rally coincides with the first phase of polling in the state that will vote in seven phases ending March 8.  Jaswantnagar will go to polls in the third phase, on February 19.

""I am not sure he is addressing any other rallies apart from Jaswantnagar. He had some plans for Mainpuri but they have been cancelled,"" said a leader close to the senior Yadav, who said he doesn't want to be identified. The Mainpuri assembly seat is one of the five segments that make up for the parliamentary constituency, also called Mainpuri, that has voted for Mulayam Singh Yadav or his nominee since 1996.

Over the last six months, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has gained complete control over the party that his father founded in the nineties and is the party's national president. As he went ahead to stitch an alliance with the Congress, Mulayam made his displeasure known again when he suggested that he would not campaign for the SP-Congress alliance.

Shivpal, till recently the party's key strategist before he was sidelined in the bitter power struggle that saw the transfer of the power within the party from Mulayam to son, Akhilesh - is fighting from his traditional seat, Jaswantnagar that he won by 1.3 lakh votes in 2012 - but he is not even a star campaigner for the party.

For many SP candidates, neither is Mulayam.

An Akhilesh aide said there hadn't been too many requests from candidates who want Mulayam to campaign for them. ""It's because of two reasons - one they don't want to rub Akhilesh the wrong way. Two, they believe that Akhilesh has the popular vote even within the party,"" the aide said.

Gagan Som was whisked away from inside the booth after a pistol was recovered from his possession. An official told IANS that the act was in contravention of election rules and hence the action was taken.

The polling is underway for the for the first of the seven phases of the high-stake Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections with voters queueing up to cast their ballots in 73 constituencies spread over 15 districts of western UP.

"UP Elections 2017: Battleground Saharanpur Is Big Test For Congress, BSP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-battleground-saharanpur-is-big-test-for-congress-bsp-1659530","SAHARANPUR:                             As Saharanpur goes to polls on Wednesday, the stakes are the highest for the Congress - its campaign spearheaded by its firebrand UP vice-president Imran Masood. The party is contesting five of the seven assembly seats in the region, where Mayawati's attempts to forge a Muslim-Dalit combination will also be put to test.

More than 40% of the people in this fertile agricultural belt, home to one of the most influential Islamic seminaries, the Darul Uloom Deoband, are Muslims. The Dalit population is around 22%. Large pockets of the Gujjar community are also there, especially in seats like Gangoh and Nakur. The latter is the seat from where Imran Masood, one of Congress' four state vice presidents, is contesting.

Mr Masood hit the headlines in 2014, when he was arrested for a hate speech against Narendra Modi, an image he wants to put behind. ""Look, to say botti botti (chopping into pieces) is... the sort of language we use colloquially... I have already said I was wrong. My politics is not of hate, and people know that,"" Masood tells NDTV.
Not everyone is as convinced.

Muzzafarnagar is next door, points out BJP supporter Dr Gupta, and after the riots and the tenor of the speeches of the BJP leaders, Muslims were looking for more dabang (fearless) Muslim leaders. But he too concedes that ""Imran has charisma and is always ready to listen to people's problems.""

Mr Masood moved out of the Samajwadi Party in 2013 to join the Congress. Now seen as a favourite of party vice president Rahul Gandhi, he is reported to have influenced the choice of candidates in all seven seats. From one seat, Gangoh, he even fielded his brother Noman.

Mr Masood is ebullient about how the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance would sweep the elections under Rahul Gandhi, whom he calls the country's ""most dynamic leader"" and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, ""the face of development"".

It is this image of power, real and sometimes exaggerated, that makes Mr Masood the chief target for his rivals. His challenges come from many quarters.

Closer home, it is his uncle Rashid Masood, who has been upset that his nephew, and not his son Shadan, was being promoted within the Congress.

Mr Masood also has to assuage angry Gujjars, who accuse him of sabotaging tickets to Gujjar candidates such as Mukesh Chowdhury. ""Please don't be angry with me,"" he tells an audience of 150 Gujjars at Mohdipur village, attempting to placate clan elders.

A short distance away, outside their huts in the poorest part of the village, a few Dalit women listen to him. But they have already made up their minds. ""We only vote for the elephant,"" they say.

The sentiment is echoed other parts of Saharanpur.

Behat sent BSP candidates to the Lok Sabha and state assembly in the last elections. ""If Mayawati gives an elephant a ticket from Behat, we will vote for it,"" says Gagan, an elderly shopkeeper from Alampur village.

The BSP has fielded Mohammad Iqbal, better known as Haji Iqbal, from Behat. For someone who had run into trouble with the Enforcement Directorate, it is no surprise that his wealth and the sprawling Glocal campus, an educational institute he set up, is a talking point. In his election affidavit, he had declared assets to the tune of 14 crore rupees.

""Haji Iqbal is the BSP's big leader and he's the one giving Masood sleepless nights,"" says Obaid, an engineer. But he is countered by colleague Sadat, who bets on Imran's popularity. The Congress nominee from the seat is Naresh Saini, but the contest in Behat has become a proxy battle between Haji Iqbal and Mr Masood.

There is another smaller, but embarrassing challenge for Mr Masood from within his own party. Saad Ali Khan, a man denied the Congress ticket is now fighting as an independent from the rural Saharanpur seat. Mr Khan, who hails from an elite family, insists he was a sure-shot winner and blames an insecure Masood of blocking his ticket."
"UP Elections 2017: Priyanka Gandhi Sets February 13 Date With Amethi, Rae Bareli","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-priyanka-gandhi-sets-february-13-date-with-amethi-rae-bareli-1658211","Lucknow:                             Congress supporters in Amethi and Rae Bareli are eagerly waiting for February 13 to catch a glimpse of Priyanka Gandhi when she will kick off her campaign for the Congress party in the two towns.   

She will campaign for five days in the two family boroughs, represented by her brother, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, and her mother Sonia Gandhi, a party leader said on Friday.

As of now, Priyanka Gandhi will only campaign for the 10 party candidates in the two parliamentary constituencies, the Congressman said on conditions of anonymity.

At a later stage, she might canvass for the joint candidates of the Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance, he added.    

""She has always been campaigning in Amethi and Rae Bareli. For the first time her name is on the star campaigners' list. If a person's name is not on the star campaigners' list, the expenses for availing helicopter services will be borne by the candidate of that particular constituency,"" said a party leader.

""If his/her name is there on the star campaigners' list, the expenses for availing the chopper will be borne by the party. The extent of campaigning and the constituencies covered depend on the candidate and not on the party. Now, it depends on her and she might campaign in a few constituencies outside Amethi and Rae Bareli. It is for her to decide,"" he added.

The Congress and Samajwadi Party, despite the alliance, had a face-off in three constituencies - Amethi, Unchahaar and Gauriganj.

Meanwhile, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has also finalised her programme and will make a rare appearance in Rae Bareli on February 20.

She has, so far, not being able to hit the campaign trail because of her ill-health.
Rahul Gandhi will address one rally in Rae Bareli on February 18 and another in Amethi, his own parliamentary constituency, on February 24.

Amethi will go to the polls on February 27 while Rae Bareli will vote on February 23."
"UP Election 2017: Ajit Singh's Party Tries to Stitch Together Rainbow Coalition","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-2017-ajit-singhs-party-tries-to-stitch-together-rainbow-coalition-1659146","The Rashtriya Lok Dal has ruled out any post-poll alliance with the BJP, enthused by reports that their traditional votebank in western Uttar Pradesh, the Jats, are angry with the BJP and may return to fold. The Jat support had swung to the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections following the Muzzaffarnagar riots, and the RLD - which had won 9 seats in 2012 assembly elections -- had drawn a blank. But with the perceived failure of the BJP to deliver on its pre-election promise of reservation in government jobs, there are reports that the Jat ire against the party has grown.

""I am focussed on polls and not looking at post-poll,"" Jayant Chaudhary, the son of party chief Ajit Singh, told NDTV. ""I can assure you that under no circumstances we are looking at the BJP as an alternative.""

As the longtime representative of Jat concerns, the RLD contends that the BJP has not kept the promises made to the Jats in 2014. There is no reservation in government jobs, better support price to sugarcane farmers was not offered and dues to sugar cane farmers remain yet to be paid. This time, the BJP has promised that if voted to power, cane dues for farmers will be paid within a fortnight.

At election rallies like the one in Kundarki constituency, a Muslim-majority constituency on the outskirts of Moradabad, Mr Chaudhary talks of building bridges between communities and thereby, a new political coalition.

""One party says the Muslims are getting together, so Hindus must all get together. Another party talks about caste. I am saying all weavers, farmers, labourers should all unite,"" he declared at the rally, taking a dig at both the BJP and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party.

But 90 km away in Bijnore, there is palpable tension after a 17-year-old Jat boy in Nayagaon was killed and his father seriously injured. All the accused in the violence -- which took place three days ago -- are Muslims, which created tension and underscored the trust deficit between the two communities.

The RLD candidate from the area had to face a hostile crowed when he visited the victim's family. ""Why can't it be treated like any other crime? Why bring it a communal angle? Such things should be banned. Do BJP leaders visit the victims of 5,000 murders and 2,000 rapes?"" Mr Chaudhury questioned.

A group of Muslim cushion makers at Kundarki, located next to Mr Chaudhary's rally in Moradabad, downplay his attempts at a rainbow coalition. ""We think it is a party of the Jats and we won't be able to vote for them,"" says Tahir, one of the workers busy stitching the cover of a cushion.

The sentiment is reciprocated 5 kilometres away in Jatupura -- a village dominated by Jatavs but which has hundreds of Jat families."

"Manipur Elections 2017: 100-Day Blockade The Biggest Poll Issue","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-100-day-blockade-the-biggest-poll-issue-1656650","Guwahati:                             The Manipur blockade by Naga groups, which will enter its 100th day tomorrow, is turning out to be the biggest issue in the assembly elections which will be held in less than a week's time. As people try to cope with the shortage of essential items, the Centre today called in two Naga leaders, who are in a jail in Manipur for allegedly masterminding the blockade, for talks.

The blockade had started on November 1 last year after Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh carved out seven new districts in the state. It has made life miserable for voters, with cooking gas shooting up to Rs. 2000 a cylinder in the black market.

On Friday, the Centre took the court's permission and flew Gaidon Kamei and Stephan Shankril to Delhi.  The two are the top leaders of the United Naga Council, or UNC, which insists that it must be part of any talks to lift the blockade.

The talks, though, remained inconclusive and another round of talks will be held on February 7.

Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said, ""The tripartite have been held and we have told our officials that the mandate is clear. Any which way we need to find a solution to this crisis"".

The blockade is the BJP's main poll plank and it wants the matter solved before the state goes to polls. The party, which won the assembly elections in Assam last year, thinks it has a chance of winning Manipur. Over the last six months, a dozen leaders of the Congress, which rules the state, have defected to the BJP.

""This is a blockade of Ibobi Singh, by Ibobi Singh and for Ibobi Singh. He has allowed this to happen for political benefits but we will not allow him to succeed,"" said Union minister Prakash Javedaker, who is in charge of the party's campaign in Manipur.

The Congress is targeting the non-Naga voters who decide 40 of 60 assembly seats by hinting at a nexus between the former Naga militant group NSCN (IM) and the UNC.

""The BJP might disagree, but it is a fact that after the creation of seven new districts, there was firing on police personal. Now if UNC is not linked to NSCN (IM), then UNC must be an armed group. Then the Centre should ban it,"" said N Bijoy Singh, the Congress spokesperson in Manipur"

According to sources, Sonia Gandhi who has been indisposed for some time and has not been active in handling party work for a few months now, is all set to campaign in Uttar Pradesh but will restrict herself to Rae Bareli.

Ending speculation on whether she will campaign in Uttar Pradesh after Congress forged a pre-poll alliance with Samajwadi Party in the state, Sonia reportedly confirmed that she will campaign in her Rae Bareli constituency.

Sources added that while both Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will campaign in Rae Bareli and Amethi, their schedule has not yet been finalised.

Sonia Gandhi did not campaign in Punjab and Goa and is yet to canvas in Uttarakhand.

Amethi and Rae Bareli go to polls in the 4th and 5th phase of polling in the state on February 23 and 27.

There are 10 assembly seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli in the Gandhi family's pocket-borough and have become a bone of contention between the two partners.

Congress will be contesting in a total of 105 seats in UP, with its ally Samajwadi Party contesting from 298 out of a total of 403 seats in the state.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Yadav also dismissed reports of intra-party differences after his brother Shivpal Yadav, who has been sidelined in the party, talked about floating a new outfit post the Assembly polls.

""There is no bickering...Akhilesh will be the next Chief Minister...I will campaign (for the alliance) from tomorrow,"" Mr Yadav told reporters on Parliament premises when asked about his opposition to the alliance and his reluctance to campaign for it.

Mr Yadav also played down reports of Mr Shivpal, who was locked in a bitter battle with Akhilesh over control of SP, planning to form new party post assembly polls in the state.

""No one is unhappy...he (Shivpal) has not spoken to me or anyone in the party. He may have said out of anger...now leave it, there will be no new party,"" he asked.

The SP patriarch had on January 29 voiced displeasure over the alliance, and said he would not campaign for it. The Samajwadi Party and Congress have forged a pre-poll alliance in Uttar Pradesh contesting 298 and 105 seats respectively.

Last week, Shivpal Yadav, unhappy over his supporters being denied party ticket for the high-voltage election, had stated he will form a new party after March 11, when the poll results will be out.

Ms Sharmila will contest from Thoubal seat, convenor of her party People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) Erendro Leichonbam, said.

Known for her fight against Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Ms Sharmila is a political greenhorn while Congress has been in power in Manipur for three successive terms under Ibobi Singh.

Congress on February 3 had released a list of 60 candidates for Manipur Assembly elections, with Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh contesting Thoubal seat.

In August last year, the 44-year-old Iron Lady broke her 16-year-old hunger strike, the world's longest such campaign, and declared that she wants to become the chief minister so that she could press for repeal of the contentious AFSPA.

While launching her party PRJA in October last year, Ms Sharmila had said she would contest from two seats - Thoubal and Khurai. While she belongs to Khurai, Thoubal is the Assembly constituency of the Chief Minister.

Leichonbam said the party has already started campaigning in Thoubal for Ms Sharmila.

However, there is no word yet about her contesting Khurai seat.

Ms Leichonbam said PRJA, which recently was allotted 'whistle' as the party's symbol, is likely to field altogether 10 candidates for the Assembly elections to be held on March 4 and 8.

Meanwhile, the Naga People's Front (NPF), the ruling party in Nagaland, has announced names of 15 candidates for the Manipur Assembly elections."

The five-hour rally featuring Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and partner Rahul Gandhi of the Congress had been designed to draw attention to the young leaders as another part of the state voted. A strategy that was first tested by PM Modi in the national election of 2014.

The plan was to divert attention with the hype around a big joint rally in the PM's constituency in eastern UP, while western UP, where the BJP is seen as strong, voted.

The Congress has said that tomorrow's road show was cancelled because the administration withdrew permission earlier granted, citing celebrations in the area of the birth anniversary of a saint Guru Ravidas. The road show would be held another day, the party said.

Varanasi's District Magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra however told NDTV that officials had been informed of ""no such programme for February 11,"" and sources said a clash of dates scuttled the road show. The Congress, before fixing the date had apparently failed to check with Akhilesh Yadav, who had already committed the date to campaigning in other parts of the states.

Mr Yadav, 43, and Mr Gandhi, 46, have held joint road shows in Lucknow, Kanpur and Agra, traveling together in a souped-up Mercedes SUV and drawing big crowds. 

Varanasi has eight assembly seats, three are held by the BJP, two each won by SP and BSP and one by Congress. But since BSP MLA Uday Lal Maurya switched over to BJP, the party has four seats. Polling will be held here on March 8, the last phase of the UP elections. There have been reports of some skirmishes between local Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders over seat sharing in the area. In their alliance, the Congress as junior partner is contesting 105 of UP's 403 seats, while the Samajwadi Party is contesting the rest.

Strategist Prashant Kishor, who had designed PM Modi's winning campaign in the 2014 national election, has been drafted by the Congress for this year's UP elections and is believed to have planned the joint road show that has been postponed. PM Modi had held a mega rally driving down the winding roads of Varanasi before those elections. Rival parties had complained about the media attention he received while voting was on in other parts of the state.

The BJP swept UP in 2014, winning 71 of the state's 80 seats.

In August Last year, Congress President Sonia Gandhi's roadshow in Varanasi had to be called off mid-way as she took ill."

Mr Kejriwal, called the electioneering in both states an ""incredible experience"" for his party. The leader remained confident of achieving victory in the assembly elections of both Punjab and Goa. Punjab saw a voter turnout of 70 per cent till 5 pm and Goa saw record 83 per cent voters turn up, said Election commission officials.

After hectic campaigning in the states Mr Kejriwal, along with Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia returned to the national capital. A known movie buff, he watched Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 'Raees' along with Mr Sisodia.

""These elections were fought by the people for the people. They spent money, campaigned door to door,"" he said in a video posted on his Facebook page.

Expressing confidence that AAP will win the elections, Mr Kejriwal said, ""It was an election of hopes. People have high hopes, and we will together fulfil those hopes."" The leader reserved special thanks for the NRI supporters, who helped the party in the polls, terming them as ""amazing people"".

In the same breath, Mr Kejriwal alleged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government harassed the donors of Aam Aadmi Party.

The Aam Aadmi Party has debuted in these states, in a bid to expand their presence beyond Delhi where they had a landslide victory in 2015. The party has not named a Chief Ministerial candidate, though its lawmaker Bhagwant Mann, AAP's tallest leader in the state, is reportedly top seeded.

Results will be announced in Punjab and Goa on March 11 along with Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur that go to polls this week."

But 25-year-old Vandana Sharma knew this the day she quietly stepped out of her house with Rs 10,000 on a chilly January morning to file her nomination papers as an independent candidate from the Fatehpur Sikri assembly constituency.

The money, a third of her Rs 32,000 that she had declared as her assets in the election affidavit, was for the security deposit.

Ms Sharma says the struggle to get her family's support was a challenge.

""My parents wanted to marry me off, this is my last resort. I need to make something of myself,"" said Ms Sharma.

Ms Sharma is pursuing her graduation in Arts from Agra college. Her battles, however, aren't only about her life.

""My village has no basic amenities. There are no colleges nearby. Girls have to be accompanied by a male member if they step out. And we can't step out after 6pm... In 21st century India, this has to change,"" says Ms Sharma, a farmer's daughter.

During campaigning in the village, Ms Sharma promised to improve the lives of women through quality education, better healthcare and a safer environment.

""I will definitely vote for her, we have spent our lives inside the house, our daughters must step out,"" said Sarla Devi.

But it is mostly a lonely battle for her. Her youngest brother who has just completed his post-graduation, Sushil Sharma, is the only one by her side.

""No one supported her initially, no one spoke to her, she went alone to file her nomination, but after seeing her work so hard, I decided to help her,"" Sushil said.

Ms Sharma knows she may not really have a chance to make it to the Uttar Pradesh assembly, but she is glad she took the plunge."

The re-poll will be held on February 9. It was ordered in the wake of the malfunctioning of Voter-Verified Audit Paper Trail (VVPAT) and Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in these stations during the polling.

The re-polling has been ordered at 12 polling stations of Majitha Assembly seat, nine each of Muktsar and Sangrur, one each of Moga and Sardulgarh and 16 polling stations of Amritsar Parliamentary constituency, official said.

""The re-polling will take place at 48 polling stations because of the malfunctioning that occurred in some VVPATs and EVMs on the polling day. The re-polling will take place on February 9,"" Punjab Chief Electoral Officer VK Singh said.

Mr Singh said the polling hours shall be from 8 am to 5 pm and all the voters queued up till 5 pm at the polling stations can cast their votes.

Punjab CEO said necessary arrangements have been made and election material, EVMs, security and poll staff in adequate numbers have been deputed for this task.

""The central paramilitary force will be deployed at each polling station and no outsider will be allowed to stay,"" he said.

Despite facing problems in VVPAT, the Election Commission said they will be used during the re-poll.

""VVPATs will be used during the re-poll. A total of 47 VVPATs will be deployed at the polling stations and sufficient numbers of machines have been kept as reserve,"" he said.

Problem in VVPAT was witnessed in Majithia, Muktsar and Sangrur assembly segments while EVMs were found faulty in Moga and Sardulgarh segments.

No VVPAT was used in Sardulgarh segment, said CEO. EC had used VVPAT for the first time in Punjab at 6,668 polling stations in 33 Assembly segments and two segments in Amritsar Lok Sabha seat.

During the mock polls, 538 VVPATs were replaced while during polling 187 VVPATs were replaced.

Polling was affected at 25 polling stations in Majitha and ten each in Sangrur and Muktsar because of VVPAT malfunctioning.

VVPAT generates a receipt and allows people to verify the vote went in favour of the candidate against whose name the button was pressed on the electronic voting machine.

In one polling station each of Moga and Sardulgarh segments, EVMs had displayed the votes cast during mock polls despite the polling beginning at 8 am.

"'You Will Have To Study Modi,' Says Prime Minister To Critics Of Notes Ban","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/perfect-timing-says-pm-narendra-modi-in-strong-defence-of-notes-ban-1656839","New Delhi:                             The economy was strong and the timing of the notes ban was perfect, PM Modi said in parliament today, in a detailed defence of his decision to abolish 500 and 1,000-rupee notes in November last year, aimed at eliminating corruption and black money. Congress governments before his would have done it, PM Modi said, if there was any electoral benefit to be derived. The PM's address comes in the middle of crucial assembly elections in five states and just ahead of voting for the first of seven phases in Uttar Pradesh.

Replying to a motion of thanks to the President's address at the start of the Budget session, the Prime Minister hit back at opposition leaders who criticised the notes ban in their speeches during the debate. ""You would have done this first, but this is not about keeping the seat of power, it entails a lot of hard work, so was not a priority for you. No worries. We do not shy away from work,"" PM Modi said.

He countered critics who have accused him of taking a hasty decision by saying, ""Nothing was done in haste. To understand that you will need to study Modi."" The ban, he said, was timed to coincide with the slump that follows a peak in trade during the Diwali festival. ""We calculated that this would be the least disruptive time and the maximum impact would be over within 50 days. Our calculation was accurate,"" the Prime Minister said.    

He was often asked, he said, why he had made the sudden decision to scrap high value notes when ""things were going fine."" It was a preventive step at a time when the economy was resilient, the PM said, asserting, ""for demonetisation, this was the most opportune time. India could handle it best at this time.""

The Congress' Mallikarjun Kharge had on Monday demanded that PM Modi apologise for the notes ban, which he said had caused people untold misery. Mr Kharge was supported by leaders of other opposition parties.

PM Modi said the notes ban has ""cleansed India, ended the shadow economy,"" underscoring that ""the strength of a policy is dependent on intent. If the intent is harmful, the policy goes into minus, not just zero.""

The steps he said were not sudden, reminding the house that the Supreme Court had asked why successive governments had done nothing to curb black money. ""We took it very seriously"" and worked towards it, he said.  

Rival parties have taken demonetisation to the election battleground, accusing the government of punishing the poor rather than the corrupt with the cash crunch that followed the notes ban announcement on November 8 last year, which took out 86 per cent of the cash in circulation. The currency shortage hit the rural poor and the middle class, farmers and small traders hardest and the government has admitted that it has also caused a slowdown of the economy, promising that will not spill over into the next year.  

The elections in five states all through February and into March are the first big electoral test that the ruling BJP faces after the notes ban. It has credited gains in by-elections and civic polls to PM Modi's firm steps against corruption, saying these are a signal of the people's support for the move."
"Manipur Elections 2017: Notification Issued For Polls In 38 Assembly Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-notification-issued-for-polls-in-38-assembly-seats-1657064","Imphal:                             Election notification was on Monday issued for 38 assembly constituencies in Manipur which would go to polls on March 4 in the first phase.

According to an official release, returning officers of 38 assembly constituencies issued the election notification, starting the poll process.

The assembly constituencies where polling would be held during the first phase are - Khundrakpam, Heingang, Khurai, Kshetrigao, Thongju, Keirao, Andro, Lamlai, Thangmeiband, Uripok, Sagolband, Keishamthong, Singjamei, Yaiskul, Wangkhei, Sekmai, Lamsang, Konthoujam, Patsoi, Langthabal, Naoriya Pakhanglakpa, Wangoi, Mayang Imphal, Nambol, Oinam, Bishnupur, Moirang, Thanga, Kumbi, Saikul, Kangpokpi, Saitu, Tipaimukh, Thanlon, Henglep, Churachandpur, Saikot and Singhat, the release said.

The last date for filing nomination papers is February 14.

Scrutiny of nomination papers will be held on February 16 while the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers is February 18.

Meanwhile, the Manipur blockade by Naga groups, which will enter its 100th day today, is turning out to be the biggest issue in the assembly elections which will be held in less than a week's time. As people try to cope with the shortage of essential items, the centre on Tuesday called in two Naga leaders, who are in a jail in Manipur for allegedly masterminding the blockade, for talks.

The blockade is the BJP's main poll plank and it wants the matter solved before the state goes to polls. The party, which won the assembly elections in Assam last year, thinks it has a chance of winning Manipur. While the Congress is targeting the non-Naga voters who decide 40 of 60 assembly seats by hinting at a nexus between the former Naga militant group NSCN (IM) and the UNC.

"UP Elections 2017: Akhilesh Yadav Desperate To Retain Power, Says PM Narendra Modi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-akhilesh-yadav-desperate-to-retain-power-says-pm-narendra-modi-1656242","Aligarh:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today took a dig at the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance for Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, saying that opposition parties were joining hands fearing that BJP will get a majority in Rajya Sabha after the polls. Addressing an election rally in Aligarh, PM Modi said that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was desperately trying to seek the help of anything to retain power.

PM Modi said that Samajwadi Party government has done ""nothing"" for development in the state. ""When the wind is so strong, even a young leader cannot face it and seeks help of anything ...even a pole...but this time BJP 'aandhi' (storm) is so strong that the Chief Minister fears that he might be blown off... The people of UP want change and justice,"" the PM said.

He used his signature style of coining acronyms to assert that BJP will bring ""Vikas"" - 'Vidyut' (electricity), 'Kanoon' (law and order) and 'Sadak' (roads), if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh.

 The Prime Minister said that his government's efforts to weed out black money from the country has created fear among opposition parties. ""We are working to save money by adopting strict measures. Will they not be angry with me and will not come together to defeat Modi? ...They feel that if they remain alone, Modi will get majority in the Rajya Sabha and make such rules that thieves, looters and the corrupt will not get any help. This is their fear,"" he said.

The Prime Minister said that Rs 40,000 crores from the treasury has been saved by linking aadhar cards and bank accounts to the central government's pension schemes which was being misused by the corrupt.

PM Modi also attacked the Akhilesh Yadav government for ""doing nothing for development"" and accused it of neither checking corruption, casteism and nepotism, nor clearing the cane farmers' dues. ""Youths were asked to pay bribe and bring recommendation for interviews by MLAs and Ministers. Poor had to mortgage land and assets to pay. This has to be stopped,"" he said.

Claiming that ""the corrupt are flourishing under the current UP administration"", PM Modi said that his government has linked pension to Aadhaar and bank accounts to check corruption.

Among the seizures, the value of gold and silver turned out to be the highest at Rs. 26.14 crore, followed by drugs to the tune of Rs. 17.89 crore, liquor at Rs. 13.36 crore and cash of Rs. 9.52 crore, an official in the state elections office said here today.

The seizure was made by surveillance teams comprising of Punjab police, Narcotic Control Bureau, state excise and income tax department starting from January 4 when the model code of conduct came into force till February 4 when the polling took place, the official said.

Punjab police intercepted cash amounting to Rs. 58 crore during special checking undertaken throughout the state and then handed over Rs. 25.33 crore to the Income Tax department for further investigation.

Police, however, after seizing Rs. 1.14 crore, released about Rs. 32 crore which belonged to some banks. Out of Rs. 25.33 crore, the income tax sleuths seized Rs. 8.38 crore and released Rs. 9.97 crore after verification. A sum of Rs. 7.35 crore was still under investigation, the official said.

With drugs remaining a major poll issue in the state, the surveillance teams including NCB seized drugs worth 17.89 crore from different parts of the state, official said.

Seized drugs included poppy husk, opium, heroin, cocaine, charas, drug powder and even medicines like Tramadol, Alprazolam, Chlotdiazepoxide, Mifepristone which are abused. The surveillance teams also seized 12.43 lakh litres of illicit and legally produced liquor worth Rs. 13.36 crore at several places in the state, the official said.

In one case, the teams had made the biggest seizure of alcohol with the recovery of over one lakh liquor bottles in Bathinda district of Punjab in the wake of assembly polls. Punjab police seized gold and silver worth Rs. 26.14 crore and prominent in this seizure was the recovery of 160 kg of raw gold from Mohali, the official said.

A total number of 2,142 FIRs were registered in connection with the seizures and 2,120 accused were arrested. 416 illegal weapons were also seized.

A total of 451 teams of flying squads and 504 static surveillance teams were functional throughout the state."
"RBI Raises Weekly Cash Withdrawal Limit To Rs. 50,000 From Feb 20, Limits End Mid-March","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/can-withdraw-rs-50-000-a-week-from-feb-20-no-limits-starting-march-13-1657253","New Delhi:                             Starting February 20, you can withdraw upto Rs. 50,000 per week from your savings account, the Reserve Bank of India said today, adding that from March 13, all caps on access to cash will end.

For now, the withdrawal per week for every savings account cannot exceed Rs. 24,000. Any money you pull out using an ATM machine counts towards this.

Restricted access to cash was announced on November 8 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he disclosed that within hours, 500- and 1,000-rupee notes would be abolished. People were given till the end of December to deposit the outlawed notes in accounts or swap them for new ones. Deposits over 2.5 lakhs would be scrutinized for tax evasion, the government said later.

The PM's demonetisation move was aimed at punishing tax evasion and corruption. Yesterday, he defended the timing of the reform - it was introduced in the middle of the festival and wedding season and as farmer were sowing their winter crop - and said that the notes ban could only have been induced when the economy was flourishing.

 The cash shortage that encompassed India in the weeks after the high-denomination notes were banned resulted in long lines at banks and ATMs. 86%of the currency in circulation had been sucked out in one go. The new, security-enhanced 500 and 2,000-rupee notes were in short supply, adding to the crunch. The pain was especially sharp in rural India with its limited access to banks and its complete dependence on cash transactions. The government has said the move has helped steer the economy towards digital transactions.

However, critics point out that there is no estimate yet from the RBI on how much of the abolished money has been returned to banks -most reports say virtually all the banned notes were turned in, demolishing the theory that black or untaxed money would be destroyed by the reform.

Elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh are being seen as the first real test of the PM's decision. He has, in one speech after another in the strategically vital state of Uttar Pradesh, stressed that the notes ban seeks to punish the corrupt and return to the poor ""what is rightfully theirs.""

Goa and Punjab voted last weekend. Uttar Pradesh votes across seven days, starting Saturday.  Results for all states, including Manipur and Uttarakhand, will be counted on March 11."
"LIVE: PM Narendra Modi's Speech In Aligarh During BJP's UP Campaign","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-pm-narendra-modis-speech-in-aligarh-during-bjps-up-campaign-1656178","Aligarh:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi is campaigned in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh today where he addressed a public meeting or rally. PM Modi is BJP's star campaigner which has not declared a chief ministerial candidate for UP.

Here are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech in Aligarh:Last time before the general elections when I visited Aligarh, the attendance was not even half of what it is today. I thank you all for your love and support.I see winds of change in Uttar Pradesh. The winds are fierce this time. The winds are so strong in favour of the BJP that the chief minister is holding on to just about anyone he can find.UP wants justice. Especially my sisters and mothers, my small time traders. This fight is for you.These days, people are issuing a fatwa against me every day. Because I am tightening the screws, because I am asking for an account of the crimes they committed over 70 years.It is shameful to see cases that have come to light here. It was found that people were withdrawing money of a widower's pension even when the woman does not exist. Tell me, is this not corruption? The corrupt are flourishing under the current UP administration. To stop this, from the Centre we have linked pension to Aadhaar and bank accounts. 40,000 crore that these rats would silently eat is now being saved.On November 8, I announced the banning of 500-and 1000-rupee notes. There was chaos amongst these corrupt people. They had to then deposit the money in bank accounts. We want that this money come to good use, for the benefit of our youth and development of our country. I am thankful to 1.2 billion people for supporting me.So many manufacturing plants were shut and Aligarh's famous locks came to use in order to lock them. You know the reason behind these plants shutting down? It happened because the UP government could not give them electricity.We are working day and night to ensure that every corner of India has electricity. We are making good progress. I am confident that electricity will reach every factory and household very soon. We are very close to achieving this. In fact we are working towards Uttar Pradesh's Vikas. By VIKAS I mean V - Vidyod (electricity), K - Kanoon (law and order), and S - Sadak (roads).The current government in Uttar Pradesh has nothing to do with vikas (development). But I want to assure the people of UP that we - the BJP - have taken this decision at the Centre to develop UP.Tell me, haven't you all faced injustice and discrimination? Let's take jobs for instance; Does one have to belong to a certain caste? or know someone who is connected politically to get a job? Is this what our constitution says? No. You all are facing this because of the current government in UP. They have failed you all. We will do our best to ensure that every young person in UP gets a job.Coming to the law and order situation in UP... Tell me, once the sun sets, can a sister or mother of any household leave their homes? Should women not have equal rights are men? Should the women be not given protection? I appeal to you all - my brothers and sisters - to save Uttar Pradesh from bullies and goons. Throw out these people who have done nothing for you, who have abandoned you, and left you without security. It is sad to see that if a person complaints about a bully or a goon, and he happens to be a relative of a politician, the complainant is scrapped. Are these the kind people who you want should run UP?To fight black money, corruption and counterfeit currency, we did demonetisation, then remonetised the economy and simultaneously started work of e-monetisation. We launched the BHIM app on Ambedkar's name. People questioned us, saying, what right does Narendra Modi have to use BR Ambedkar's name? I want to remind them that he was the economist under whom the Reserve Bank of India was formed. He was a great man and his contributions will never be forgotten. I don't care if people are jealous, but I will always honour him and hold him in highest regard."

Urging the Election Commission to increase security of EVMs, Senior AAP leader and Advocate HS Phoolka said, ""the surveillance of EVMs here should be increased as the arrangements are inadequate"".

The area surrounding the strong rooms needs enhanced security as AAP has noticed suspicious movement of some people around the 500-metre area surrounding the rooms, he said, adding that there can be an attempt to harm the EVMs.

The Aam Aadmi Party leader said his party has sent a letter to the Election Commission regarding the security issues and demanded that the number of security personnel should also be increased to ensure the safety and surveillance of the EVMs in the nine assembly constituencies.

Mr Phoolka said the movement of people in the area surrounding the strong rooms should also be controlled."
"Manipur Elections 2017: BJP, Congress Fight Over Talks Failure With Naga Protestors","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-bjp-congress-fight-over-talks-failure-with-naga-protestors-1657928","Guwahati:                             Ahead of the assembly elections in Manipur, scheduled for March 4, the ruling Congress in Manipur has now launched a political campaign over the failure of the second round of talks between the Centre, the state government and the United Naga Council to end the economic blockade, which completed 100-days earlier this week.

The Congress alleges that the Centre is soft on NSCN (IM), which is seen as the mastermind behind the blockade.

""We have been requesting the Centre that it has to talk to NSCN (IM) since it an pen truth that the UNC is working on their behest. It is the Centre who is talking peace with the NSCN(IM),"" said G Gaikhangam, deputy chief minister of Manipur.

The BJP was quick to counter the Congress' allegations.

""How can they say UNC is backed by NSCN(IM) and why do they not ban them. These are all baseless accusations. The Congress is to be blamed since it decided to create seven districts overnight,"" said N Biren Singh, a former Congress leader who is now with the BJP.

The UNC decided to continue with the protest despite signing an agreement earlier with the state government wherein the protestors agreed to consider lifting the blockade. The Centre had claimed that ""substantial progress"" was made to resolve the issue after the first round of talks between the stakeholders, held on February 3, in the national capital.

The over economic blockade - called by the UNC after the state government decided to bifurcate Naga dominated areas and create seven new districts - has crippled everyday life in Manipur. Long queues at fuel stations have become a common sight in the state capital of Imphal whereas LPG cylinders are being sold for Rs. 2,000 each in the black market."
"After Punjab and Goa, Arvind Kejriwal's Next Big Target: Gujarat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/after-punjab-and-goa-arvind-kejriwals-next-big-target-gujarat-1656549","New Delhi:                             Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party will contest the assembly elections in Gujarat - the home state of his political arch-rival Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- sources in the party said. Elections are due in Gujarat later this year. The decision was made by Mr Kejriwal after his return from campaigning in Punjab and was announced at a meeting of the party's highest decision making body - the Political Affairs Committee - at his home last night.  

Mr Kejriwal, who went to Bengaluru today for his annual health sojourn, has asked all division heads of the party to begin groundwork and go full throttle for both Gujarat election and the Delhi municipal election, which will also be held later this year. The national unit of the party will start working in Gujarat right away, while the Delhi unit will focus on the municipal elections.

AAP is hoping to expand its presence in a big way in Punjab and Goa, where the party contested all seats. In Punjab, it was seen as making a decisive impact, flying in planeloads of NRIs for its high-voltage campaign.

Gujarat has been a BJP heartland and the turf of PM Modi, who was Chief Minister of the state for 13 years before moving to the Centre. Sources in AAP said the party was hoping to cash in on what it described as the absence of a credible opposition.

Gulab Singh, the Delhi legislator who is in-charge of the party's Gujarat affairs, said the campaign will be aimed at ""freeing the people of Gujarat from the fear, corruption, injustice and exploitation prevalent under the present government"".

Mr Kejriwal has already recced Gujarat, holding several rallies there last year. After Mr Singh was arrested ahead of his rally in Surat, Mr Kejriwal had accused BJP chief Amit Shah of going out of his way to stop the rally. AAP sources said the campaign will give special attention to the BJP chief.

""AAP's strategy is to contest elections in states that have a two-cornered fight and where the opposition is weak,"" a leader said.  

For the Delhi civic body, currently dominated by the BJP, AAP will be basing its campaign on sanitation and corruption."

Sources in the Election Commission said the authorities had taken a slew of steps in this regard.

Estimates of the 2012 assembly election revealed that as many as 488 polling stations were vulnerable to heavy snowfall.

This year's revised figures stand at 803. The identified booths, spread over 35 assembly constituencies, are located in the state's high-altitude zones, which bear the brunt of heavy snowfall every winter, especially in January and February.

Uttarakhand Chief Electoral Officer Radha Raturi said, ""Keeping in mind the high altitude and inclement weather conditions, several arrangements are being made to ensure that polling parties in the 803 stations reach their destination on time and have all the necessary facilities to cope with the bad winter conditions.""

""Each of the 803 polling stations would witness 8,000-10,000 voters this year,"" she added. The EC would provide 5,302 sleeping bags, high-altitude shoes and jackets to the officials assigned to the poll-duty.

Uttarakashi has the maximum number of snow-affected polling stations in the state (318), followed by Nainital (85) and Dehradun (76). Except Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar district, all other 11 districts have polling stations which receive heavy snowfall during winters.

The EC has also identified 212 snow-affected roads in the state, the maximum being in Chamoli district.

The district administration has been put on high alert to ensure that snowfall does not pose a challenge in the upcoming polls.

Earlier in the month, there were reports of about 100 families in remote Pithoragarh who had decided to boycott the election and complained to the EC after the administration had failed to provide a proper road access to the villages."
"UP Elections 2017: Newborn Symbol Of Samajwadi Party's Notes Ban Politics","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-newborn-symbol-of-samajwadi-partys-notes-ban-politics-1656991","Kanpur Dehat:                             Khazanchi can't speak, can barely smile, and is learning how to hold his head steady. He is the star of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's campaign.

In rallies across the state ahead of elections from Saturday, Akhilesh Yadav makes it a point to talk about Khazanchi, who was born two months ago, in a bank queue after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's notes ban, which has been criticized by opposition parties.

""A child was delivered while standing in the queue, I honoured the name that bank employees gave him (Khazanchi) and provided support of 2 lakh,"" Mr Yadav, also the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief, said at a recent rally in Kanpur, reminding his audience that it was only the poor, and not the rich, who bore the brunt.

Khazanchi's mother Sarvesha Devi had waited for five hours outside a bank branch in Jhinjhak town when she went into labour. The baby boy is her fifth child, born after the recent death of her husband, a snake charmer.

Bank employees and others suggested the newborn be named Khazanchi, which means treasurer or cashier. She agreed.

In times of elections, Khazanchi has been introduced early to the world of politics.

Well before he turned a month old, Akhilesh Yadav awarded Rs 2 lakh to his mother in a move perceived to be high on political symbolism; a high profile election in the state was just around the corner.

Back in their village around 40 km from the district headquarters, which has about 450 voters from backward castes, Khazanchi is fast asleep on the only cot the family has, outside their mud house.

""Yes, this baby boy has given me hope that I can survive,"" says Sarvesha Devi, sharing her daily struggle to make ends meet.

What is her view of the government's overnight ban on high value currency notes, which forced millions like her to spend hours in queues outside banks and ATMs for cash? She shrugs, ""Don't ask me about politics. I have no idea.""

Aruna Kori, a junior culture minister in Akhilesh government and local SP candidate for the Rasulabad seat that goes to vote on 19 February, conceded Khazanchi was a ""big part of her election campaign"". ""At least Akhilesh helped the child,"" she says, a rebuttal to BJP leaders who insist the baby's birth ""doesn't really prove anything"".

Kori's rival from the BJP, Nirmala Shankhwar, responded: ""If he is a star, he is a star for everyone and not just one political party... In the villages everyone is saying the notes ban was absolutely good""."

""Yes, there are some seats on which candidates of both the parties are challenging each other. The issue will be resolved,"" Samajwadi Party Chief Spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury told PTI when asked to comment on the issue.

Even Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar said the matter would be sorted out in a couple of days.

""Leaders of both parties will campaign in support of candidates declared by the alliance on the seats where nominees of both sides have filed their papers,"" he said. But, political observers said with only a day left for the first phase polling on February 11 the damage seems to have been done already with candidates of both parties already on the ground.

""The alliance is set to witness some unfriendly contest in these seats,"" said a political expert.

The situation is worse in the Gandhi family pocket borough - Amethi and Raebareli - represented by Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi in the Lok Sabha.

There are 10 assembly seats in Amethi and Raebareli. In Raebareli's Sareni seat, Ashok Singh (Congress) and Devendra Pratap Singh (Samajwadi Party) are challenging each other.

Likewise, in Unchahar Ajay Pal Singh (Congress) is facing cabinet minister Manoj Kumar Pandey (Samajwadi Party).

In Amethi, sitting MLA and Mulayam Singh Yadav loyalist Gayatri Prasad Prajapati is in the fray on SP ticket, while Congress has decided to field Amita Singh there.

In Gauriganj seat too, confusion prevails with Congress candidate Mohd Naeem challenging Rakesh Pratap Singh (Samajwadi Party).

The UP Pradesh Congress Committee chief, however, made light of the issue saying, Samajwadi Party candidates had filed their nomination papers when it appeared that the alliance will not come through.

"Yes, Want Triple Talaq Totally Abolished, Says Law Minister RS Prasad","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/triple-talaq-blatantly-unconstitutional-law-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-to-ndtv-1656585","New Delhi:                             A day after his comments on triple talaq made headlines in the backdrop of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told NDTV that ideally, the government wants it to be abolished completely and not settle for the traditional three-month reconciliation period stipulated by Shariat.

""The ideal (situation) would be that triple talaq should go... if the 3-month period is allowed to go it can go, but will the discrimination continue thereafter?"" Mr Prasad said. ""The world over, divorce with mutual consent is the norm.""

While triple talaq -- the practice of Muslim men getting an instant divorce by saying ""talaq"" thrice - has come under intense criticism from the courts and the civil society, the elections in Uttar Pradesh, a state with a sizeable population of Muslims, has brought in under political scrutiny again.  

The opposition has accused the Law Minister of playing up the issue to influence voting in Uttar Pradesh. The seven-phase election will start in the state from February 11.

The Supreme Court is currently hearing several petitions on triple talaq. Women have alleged that they were being divorced via Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken on the issue, saying the government could not allow the lives of Muslim women to be ruined by triple talaq.

Admitting that it was an election issue for his party, Mr Prasad dared the state's ruling Samajwadi Party, its ally Congress, and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party to make their stands clear.

""The government had conveyed this to the Supreme Court in its affidavit more than 3 months ago, even before the elections were announced. I am not shifting the goalposts, they are,"" Mr Prasad said of the opposition.

""Uttar Pradesh is a big state. A lot of Muslim women come from that state. They have complained about Triple Talaq. Many of them have shared stories of victimisation,"" he said.

The law minister added, ""We respect freedom of religion and faith. But every pernicious practice can't be part of religion. Twenty countries have abolished or regulated triple talaq. Even Islamic countries have banned it."""

The statues built when Mayawati was the chief minister were covered in the 2012 Assembly polls on the orders of the election commission.

To a question on the possibility of covering statues of Mayawati and elephants, Chief Election Commissioner Naseem Zaidi on Thursday said, ""The Supreme Court has given directives in this connection and we have also given some guidelines in its pursuance... this issue is no more under the consideration of the commission.""

The CEC however did not elaborate on the directives of the apex court or poll panel guidelines in this regard. Mr Zaidi was here to review poll preparations in the 73 seats of western Uttar Pradesh which are going to polls on Saturday in the first of the seven phased Assembly elections.

To another question, Mr Zaidi said those who had migrated from Kairana for any reason will be extended security if they take part in the polling process in their respective areas.

Stressing that representatives of various political parties and officials met the commission in the past two days in Lucknow, Mr Zaidi said officials have been asked to give a declaration if any of their relatives is in poll fray so that a check could be maintained on them.

Besides, orders have been issued to transfer within 48 hours officials who have been posted at a particular place for three years, the CEC said, adding the poll panel has summoned records of all police station in-charges and action will be taken against all those found lax.

To a question on BJP's demand for removal of the chief secretary and the DGP of the state, he said the matter is in election commission's knowledge.

In order to check distribution of liquor to voters during elections, the excise department has set up checkposts at the inter-state borders as well as along the border with Nepal, he said, adding the commission has set up a police cell to keep tab on messages received through WhatsApp and social media.

Mr Zaidi said those who reach the polling centre by 5 pm will be allowed to cast their votes even if it meant that the polling parties have to overstay.

Also arrangements will be made to airlift any polling staff who falls ill on duty and ensure his treatment, he said."

Welcoming him into the party-fold, Mr Fernandes said his induction would benefit the party in Uttar Pradesh.

""After Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi approved his joining, Umed Singh has joined the Congress party. We welcome him into the party-fold. I am sure the party will benefit from him in Uttar Pradesh,"" he said.

Mr Singh has come back into the Congress from Bahujan Samaj Party, which he had joined after quitting the Congress. He enjoys support in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh where Phoolan Devi hailed from.

Mr Singh has contested the Lok Sabha election thrice. In 2014, he contested from Shahjahanpur on a BSP ticket after he joined it in 2012.

In 2003, Singh was formally inducted into the Haryana Congress.

The then Haryana Congress president Dharampal Singh was also present along with him on Tuesday.

""I was in Congress earlier and I have realised that all sections can progress only under the Congress,"" Umed Singh said, adding that ""we want a Congress party government to be formed at the Centre in 2019"".

Asked if he would contest Assembly elections in UP, he said he would abide by the directions of party leaders.

Two years after her release from prison, Phoolan Devi was elected as MP from the Mirzapur Lok Sabha seat in 1996. She served as an MP in the 11th Lok Sabha (1996-98), but lost her seat in 1998 election. She was re-elected in 1999 election and was the sitting member of Parliament for Mirzapur when she was assassinated."

Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal hopes to regain lost ground in the state
Both RLD and BJP are courting Jat voters, hoping to win big in UP
                                About 10 km before you enter Muzzafarnagar town in western Uttar Pradesh, a massive security barricade is manned by many paramilitary personnel in olive green fatigues and holding automatic weapons. In this sugar belt of UP, the extra security deployed by the Election Commission is a reminder of the 2013 clashes between Jats and Muslims that claimed over 60 lives. Months later, the Jats of western UP, once the core support base of Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal, voted en masse for the BJP in a polarised national election of 2014. The BJP took all the seats in the region.

Ajit Singh and his son, Jayant Chaudhary, are trying to regain lost ground in what is seen as their fight to stay relevant when the region votes on Saturday in the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. In 2012, Ajit Singh's party had won all its nine seats in western UP, the number shrinking in comparison to earlier elections.

The RLD's pitch this time is simple. It says the BJP has not kept the promises it made to the Jats in 2014 - its government at the Centre has not given them reservation in government jobs, the hike in procurement prices for sugarcane farmers isn't substantial and it has done little to ensure that sugar mill owners pay arrears to farmers.

""Lok Dal people are straightforward and not like others who lie,"" Jayant Chaudhary told a gathering of RLD supporters and urged them to take his message to every village in the area. ""The RLD is the only party that can bridge the divide between communities,"" he added as he wrapped up and flew away in a helicopter for his next public meeting in Mathura.
 In 2012, Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal party had won all its nine seats in western Uttar Pradesh.Ajit Rathee, who heads the RLD in Muzzafarnagar, said, ""The main issue here is that of farmers. Neither the Centre nor the state government has given anything to them. That's why our supporters, our Jat brothers have come back to our party.""

The BJP knows it will find it difficult to repeat its 2014 sweep of the region if the Jats abandon it. BJP candidates are stoutly countering the RLD, claiming their leaders are doing their best to get farmers their due.

Vijay Kashyap, a non-Jat BJP candidate in the Charthawal constituency of Muzzafarnagar talks about how union minister Sanjeev Baliyan, a parliamentarian from the region, ensured that sugar mills paid arrears to sugarcane growers. ""There was a payment problem with the sugar mills were but Balyan ensured that we got farmers our money,"" said Mr Kashyap.
 To avoid situations like last time, Election Commission deployed extra security.At a village gathering next to the Titavi sugar mill, opinion was clearly divided. The older Jats here were angry that the BJP has not honoured its commitments; they also talked nostalgically about Ajit Singh's father and former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, still considered the tallest Jat leader in these parts. The younger ones said there was still time for the ruling party to come good on its promises.

UP votes in seven phases starting Saturday, when polling will be held for 73 of 403 seats in the state. Unlike the rest of the state, where most seats will see tight contests between the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, the BJP and Mayawati's BSP, in the sugarcane belt of western UP, the RLD will make it a four-cornered fight.

Votes will be counted on March 11."

He said the margin will be even bigger than last time when the Akali-BJP combine had formed the government for the second time consecutively. For years, Punjab had alternated between the Akali Dal and the Congress. The Akalis in 2012 assembly elections had won 56 of state's 117 seats, and its ally the BJP had won 12, to form the government under Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal.

For the debutant, the Aam Aadmi Party, which had jolted Punjab politics by winning four seats in Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and had later wiped out the ruling Congress in 2015 Delhi assembly elections and reduced BJP to a mere three seats, Mr Badal said would be a distant third when the results are announced on March 11.

The SAD president Sukhbir Badal is fighting from Jalalabad and is challenged by comic-turned politician and AAP lawmaker Bhagwant Mann, who is among the frontrunners for chief minister's post if the party wins.

The elections in Punjab will also see a stiff battle in Lambi, the home turf of the Akalis and the seat of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, where he is challenged by Congress' chief ministerial candidate and state president Captain Amarinder Singh and AAP's Jarnail Singh.

Parkash Singh Badal, once the youngest Chief Minister of Punjab in 1970 at the age of 43, will retain the top spot if Akali-BJP government creates history with a third consecutive win. Congress' Captain Amarinder Singh who is taking on the Chief Minster has declared this to be his last elections.

Also in the fray is Sukhbir Badal's estranged cousin and an erstwhile minister in Akali government Manpreet Badal, who is now fighting on a Congress ticket. On the challenge from his own family member, Sukhbir Badal said he was sure to be defeated from Bhatinda.

Countering the anti-incumbency after two consecutive terms, the Akali Dal will be aided by the support of Sirsa's powerful sect Dera Sacha Sauda which has declared its support for the Akali-BJP combine."

Badal village is part of the Lambi assembly constituency which the chief minister represents.

""We will win easily. Punjab is looking forward to peace and development,"" the 89-year-old chief minister said after voting.

Mr Badal is locked in a mega prestige battle with Congress's chief ministerial candidate Captain Amarinder Singh, 75, in Lambi. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party has fielded Jarnail Singh here take on the two big political heavyweights.

Since 1997, Mr Badal has contested and won from Lambi, but in the last election his margin of victory over the Congress candidate was about 25,000 votes, not a big gap for the presumptive chief minister of the winning side.

""We will register a better victory this time. Amarinder Singh will lose his security deposit,"" Sukhbir Singh Badal, who is the president of the Shiromani Akali Dal, told the media after casting his vote.

Sukhbir Singh Badal is himself locked in another mega battle in Jalalabad with Bhagwant Mann, seen as AAP's leading contender for chief minister if the party wins.

Parkash Singh Badal's Shiromani Akali Dal, in alliance with the BJP, has ruled Punjab for two straight terms - 10 years. Parkash Singh Badal's career is seven decades long and he has been Punjab chief minister five times, the first 47 years ago, when he became the country's youngest chief minister in 1970.

                                After the Income Tax department's report alleging enough discrepancies in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)'s donation records to strip it of its political party status, Arvind Kejrwal today called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a ""shameless dictator"".

The tax department has claimed in a report to the Election Commission that audit reports prepared by AAP for donations amounting to about Rs. 27 crore are false.

Records of donations made to the four-year-old party between 2013 and 2015 has ""factual discrepancies"" that do not match the money it received from donors, says the department, which has reportedly been investigating AAP's donations for over a year.

Parties prepare audit reports in consultation with their charted accountants, and submit a copy to the I-T department as per law.
 Led by Arvind Kejriwal, the Aam Aadmi Party is debuting in Punjab and Goa elections.Officials said AAP's Treasurer has acknowledged ""certain errors"" in these records in their communication with the taxman.

The Income Tax report, they say, suggests violations of tax laws that govern political donations. AAP should lose tax exemptions and should be ""de-registered"", tax officials have reportedly suggested, but only the powerful Election body can decide.

AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal blamed the tax report on ""Modiji's dirty tricks"". The Delhi Chief Minister also said the government is targeting his party because the BJP is headed for a defeat in the Punjab and Goa elections, where voting takes place on Saturday.

""Modiji's dirty tricks. Losing badly in Goa n Punjab, he tries to de-register the winning party 24 hrs before elections. Shameless dictator,"" Mr Kejriwal tweeted.

He was elevated to the Union Cabinet as Defence Minister in 2014
He could make a comeback in state politics following the Goan election
                                Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar was an early voter in Goa capital Panaji today. He had queued up before polling booths opened and was done by 7:10 am. He then told reporters, who have had just one question for him for weeks, ""I have lost 4 kg in Delhi because of the food. I like Goan food. You can interpret this the way you want.""

Goa is abuzz with speculation that Mr Parrikar could return to the state as chief minister if the BJP is re-elected. Top BJP leaders like party chief Amit Shah and union minister Nitin Gadkari have while campaigning hinted that a Parrikar comeback is not ruled out. Mr Parrikar has refused to comment on what he calls ""mere assumptions"" but seems to enjoy handing out abstract statements like he did today.

Goan Fish Curry over Butter Chicken of course, he said today, also stating that he is a ""party man, let the party decide."" Mr Parrikar was chief minister when he was called up for union cabinet duty to New Delhi. He installed in his place loyalist Laxmikant Parsekar, who has struggled to fill Mr Parrikar's big shoes.
 Manohar Parrikar came to the polling station just after voting began at 7 am today
Mr Parrikar, who has a big following in Goa and considered key for BJP to be re-elected, has been in the coastal state for the last few weeks to craft the BJP's campaign strategy and oversee its execution.

The BJP is seen to be keeping voters engaged with its guessing game as it attempts to replicate its win of 2012. Five years ago Manohar Parrikar had led the party to victory with strategic alliances. The Defence Minister, who has been Goa chief minister twice, remains the BJP's most popular leader in the state and is called the ""super chief minister.""

This year BJP and regional party MGP are fighting separately; the MGP has tied up with two other parties including one led by Subhash Velingkar, who was sacked by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor, and has vowed revenge against the party.

It also has to factor in Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party that debuts in Goa this time, fielding a popular former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate. There is also the Congress which has tried to consolidate after losing the state to the BJP in the last election.
""It is a four-cornered contest, but three corners are very weak,"" Mr Parrikar said sticking to his assessment that the BJP will get a two-thirds majority. The party had won 21 of the state's 40 seats last time. It is contesting 36 seats this year. The four seats have independent candidates backed by the BJP.

Mr Parrikar said he expects the voter turnout to cross 85 per cent this time. By 11 am that seemed possible with 34 per cent votes cast in brisk polling. The Defence Minister claimed credit. ""Goa votes very heavy and this is a speciality that the BJP has inducted in the politics of the state. Initial indications are good,"" he said.

Votes will be counted for today's election on March 11, along with four other states."

He formally joined the Shiromani Akali Dal in January.

""Below my dignity?"" the Akali candidate wondered. ""I don't know who drew this lakshman rekha (line),"" he said, calling politics an opportunity to serve the people.

Barring the death of a 78-year-old man outside a polling booth in Panaji city, no untoward incident has been reported from anywhere in the state.

Election Commission of India's data from various polling booth showed that about 53 per cent of 11.10 lakh voters turned up to exercise franchise in the first six hours.

An impressive 83 per cent voting was recorded in the state in 2012 assembly polls, which saw the BJP wresting power from the Congress.

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, widely seen as the chief ministerial face of the BJP, Union minister Shripad Naik and Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar were among the early voters who cast their ballots.

Long queues were seen outside almost all the polling stations right from the morning in the state.

Except for minor incidents of EVM failures, which were soon rectified, and cancellation of voting in one booth, polling is progressing peacefully in over 1,642 booths across the state, to decide the fate of 250 contestants in the fray.

The election is being closely fought by major political forces BJP, Congress, AAP and MGP-led alliance, who have mounted a hectic campaign.

The polls will decide future of Goa's five former chief ministers Churchill Alemao, Pratapsinh Rane, Ravi Naik, Digambar Kamat and Luizinho Faleiro and the incumbent Lxmikant Parsekar.

BJP has put up 36 aspirants, Congress 37 and AAP is contesting on 39 seats, and each of them backing independents in a few seats.

BJP, which had a pre-poll alliance in 2012, is going it alone this time, after the MGP called-off the partnership and forged a front with Goa Suraksha Manch floated by RSS rebel Subhas Velingkar and Shiv Sena.

Leslie Saldanha, 78, who was waiting to cast his vote in Panaji collapsed and died, officials said.

Mr Saldanha was immediately rushed to Goa Medical College and Hospital but he was declared brought in dead."
"Punjab Elections 2017: No Tri-Cornered Fight, Congress Is Way Ahead, Says Amarinder Singh","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-elections-2017-no-tri-cornered-fight-congress-is-way-ahead-says-amarinder-singh-1656037","Patiala:                             Fighting his last elections, former chief minister and Congress' Punjab chief Captain Amarinder Singh has said he does not believe the assembly elections in Punjab is a tri-cornered contest. He said the ruling Akali-BJP combine and debutant the Aam Aadmi Party were way behind the Congress according to early reports on voting in Punjab. Mr Singh who is fighting from Patiala, his home turf, against Akali candidate and former army chief General JJ Singh, has also challenged Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal from his traditional seat of Lambi.

The performance of AAP, poised as a disrupter in the state which has elected the Akali Dal and the Congress in alternate elections, is being watched with keen interest as the four-year-old party attempts to extend its influence beyond Delhi, where it swept assembly elections two years ago.

But Mr Singh says the Congress is the 'new dawn' that Punjab needs. ""The people have voted for stability versus communal and radical politics. The people of Punjab want the experience and expertise of Congress to get the state back on the rails of progress and development, Mr Singh said.

Mr Singh said the Shiromani Akali Dal has ""ripped apart the state's social, religious and economic fabric"" and its ally both in the state and at the centre, the BJP, was equally responsible.

""People don't want SAD's mafia and communal ideology, nor do they want AAP's radical extremism,"" Mr Singh said, adding, ""People have voted for securing the future of their children. Punjab stands at the brink of a positive change, and Congress is all set to provide it.""

Punjab votes today in a single phase. The results for the state - along with Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur - will be announced on March 11.

The former state finance minister, who quit the Shiromani Akali Dal in 2010 following a fallout with his uncle's government, rejected the notion that he has mixed emotions about fighting his cousins in the crucial state polls.

""There are no mixed emotions because I was trained that loyalty must always be for India and Punjab. Loyalty cannot be graded with your family or friends,"" he said.

""Ministers are usually sacked on account of a scandal or corruption. It was probably the first time in the history of India that a finance minister resigned from the cabinet because he did not agree with the policies of his own government,"" Mr Manpreet added, referring to his resignation in 2010.

He also spoke about the experiences of forming the People's Party of Punjab, which eventually merged with the Congress.

""Whatever change we tried to bring: curbing VIP culture, breaking the nexus between the police and politicians, and getting Punjab free from debt. I think there are no emotions involved. These things must be done,"" he further stated.

Interestingly, he arrived at the polling booth in an open jeep which, he told NDTV, he considers ""lucky"".

""This is my lucky jeep,"" said Mr Manpreet. ""This is my favourite jeep. It is a former Indian military jeep. It used to be fitted with a recoilless gun. It has always proved lucky for me as it has proved lucky for the Indian Army.""

Mr Manpreet, who joined the Congress ahead of the polls, is the party's candidate from the Bathinda Urban constituency where he faces Deepak Bansal of the Aam Aadmi Party and incumbent legislator Sarup Chand Singla of the Shiromani Akali Dal.


The 53-year-old also contested as a Congress candidate from the Bathinda Lok Sabha seat in 2014 against Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the wife of Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, where he lost by a little over 19,000 votes.

He was announced as Congress' chief ministerial candidate in Punjab
Amarinder Singh is the former Chief Minister of Punjab and ex-Amritsar MP
                                A red carpet rolled out in a polling booth in Patiala where Capitan Amarinder Singh and his family will cast their vote triggered accusations from rival parties that the special treatment was aimed at the Congress' chief ministerial candidate, a local royal.

Patiala is one of the two assembly seats from where Amarinder Singh is contesting.

Lambi constituency - a four-hour long drive from Patiala - is the other. There, Amarinder Singh has challenged Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal of the Akali Dal who has never lost an election from this seat since 1997.

It is in Patiala - where he is pitted against Akali Dal candidate, India's first Sikh Army chief JJ Singh - however, that Amarinder Singh is at home. His forefathers were Maharajas of Patiala. 

As polling started early this morning, there were murmurs of protest from polling agents of rival parties at the VIP polling booth.

Flustered at the attention that the special arrangements were getting, election officials initially rolled back the red carpet.

It was, however, rolled out again, sometime later.

Election officials brushed aside charges that the special treatment was targeted at an individual voter, or a candidate.

The Election Commission had come up with the concept of a model polling booth during elections to the 2015 Delhi Legislative Assembly. A red carpet welcome of the voters and flowers being presented to them was one part of the concept. 

""One important defining fact for such a value addition would be the actual experience of the voter at the polling station on the day of voting,"" the Election Commission's manual says, outlining facilities that a model booth should have including standby arrangement in case of power cuts."

When confronted with the strong speculation of a possible return of Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar in Goan politics, he said that the chief minister will be decided by the party legislators.

""You have to ask Mr Parrikar,"" Mr Parsekar, who is contesting from the Mandrem constituency, said when asked about the Defence Minister's possible homecoming. He added that the next chief minister will be ""decided by the MLAs"".

""It is not a new thing,"" Mr Parsekar said.

The chief minister also equated the assembly election in Goa to an examination.

""We are contesting the polls after a successful tenure in Goa. It is an examination for the BJP's performance over the last five years,"" he said.

""I don't anyone has achieved what the BJP has achieved in the last five years in terms of infrastructure - bridges, roads, hospitals, parks, market complexes. We also managed to formulate a network of social welfare schemes which benefits every deserving household,"" the chief minister claimed.

He also reflected upon the performance of the BJP in the last five years as well as the BJP's agenda for the next five years, should they win.

""This election is very crucial for the future of Goa. Our first agenda is the creation of jobs and the eradication of unemployment,"" he further stated.

""There is no feeling of anti-incumbency in any constituency. I am confident that the BJP is retaining the state with absolute and clear majority,"" a confident Laxmikant Parsekar said.

Mr Parsekar was appointed Goa's Chief Minister after Manohar Parrikar was elevated to the Union Cabinet as Defence Minister in 2014. However, Mr Parrikar could make a comeback in state politics after BJP's national president said that the new Goa government would work under the leadership of Mr Parrikar, should the BJP retain power in the state.

"'UP Will Turn Into Kashmir:' BJP Lawmaker Yogi Adityanath Attacks Akhilesh Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-will-turn-into-kashmir-bjp-lawmaker-yogi-adityanath-attacks-akhilesh-yadav-1655484","Bulandshahr:                             Yogi Adityanath, lawmaker and top BJP crowd puller, today said Western Uttar Pradesh will ""turn into Kashmir and will see a mass exodus,"" if Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party is not removed from power. The sensitive region, which saw deadly riots three years ago, votes next week in the first phase of the UP assembly elections.  

The BJP alleges that over 300 Hindu families have fled their homes in Kairana, a Muslim-dominated Western UP town, which is denied by the Samajwadi Party government that says an inquiry has revealed no mass immigration based on religious grounds. Yogi Adityanath alleged today that the number is actually much more and that the SP was suppressing facts.

""Kairana is just one town. There are dozens of villages where an exodus is happening. Women were being harassed and so families were forced to leave. Please go there and see. They don't register FIRs in crimes committed on Hindus,"" the five-time MP from Gorakhpur told NDTV.

He said the comparison with Kashmir, where 3.5 lakh Pandits left the Valley in fear in the 1990s, is fair because, ""if left unchecked, the situation will be similar.""

BJP chief Amit Shah has brought up the issue repeatedly during his campaign in UP and while releasing the party's manifesto last week promised a white paper, saying the BJP, if elected, would make government officials responsible for the safe return of the ""migrated population.""

Both regional heavyweights the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party as well as the Congress have accused the BJP of polarising voters, especially in Western UP where 62 people were killed in the 2013 communal violence. Months later, the BJP swept UP in the general elections winning 71 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats. Among the winners were leaders like Hukum Singh, who first made the Kairana allegation and who is accused of inciting violence in Muzaffarnagar, the epicentre of the riots.    

Yogi Adityanath was speaking today in Sikanderabad, in Bulandshahr and an area that has a Muslim and Dalit majority population. While the Bulandshahr gang-rape figured in his speech, he used the metaphor of rape more in the context of crimes along communal lines and not just a law and order problem. ""It is not just Hindus but Dalits are also leaving. So we must vote out these people who practice identity politics,"" the 44-yer-old priest-politician alleged.

Some days ago the controversial lawmaker had raised eyebrows by welcoming US President Donald Trump's ""Muslim ban"". Today, he played that down but made no attempt to conceal his admiration for America's new president.

Yogi Adityanath's army of supporters in eastern UP have put the BJP on notice demanding that he be named presumptive Chief Minister in UP, where elections will be held in seven phases and votes will be counted on March 11. They have threatened to field candidates to spoil the chances of the BJP's official nominees. But Mr Adityanath denies any rebellion.

""I don't care about such posts. I am for ideology and only here to defeat the SP and BSP,"" he said.

Rebel or not, Yogi Adityanath clearly has star status in the BJP - the party has assigned him a chopper to zip across the state to campaign, as the party attempts to win the state back after 15 years."

Nearly 30 per cent of the electorate comprises servicemen, ex-servicemen and their families. In the upcoming state elections, thus political parties are trying their best to woo the 'fauji' vote-bank.

BJP legislator from Mussoorie Ganesh Joshi, who was accused of assaulting police horse 'Shaktiman' during protest and arrested after a national outrage over the incident, claims over 6,000 ex-servicemen are supporting him alone. Canvassing in Kandli village, Mr Joshi said, ""You can see it for yourself. I asked them (ex-servicemen) how much did you get after the government announced OROP (One Rank One Pension) and they said that after sixty years if there is anyone who has fulfilled our promise, it is the BJP.""

""Never before had surgical strikes happened in this way; it sends a message that the BJP government is both willing and ready to do something for its people"", said Bhawani Singh, an ex-servicemen campaigning for Mr Joshi.

""This (BJP) government has made everything digital. Not only have they increased the pension, one can also access it more easily now,"" added Hari Kang, another second generation retired soldier from the same regiment.

In neighbouring Nangnath village however, families of the faujis seemed more taken in by the Congress candidate Godawari Thapli, who enjoys the support of the Gurkha which community has an electoral base of 12 lakh and harbour a formidable reputation in the army.

""We are fauji families whose sons are still serving in the army. As of now we are with the Congress. Let's see what happens ahead,"" adds 28-year-old Anjana.

The Congress has condemned the BJP for making OROP and the surgical strikes a political issue. ""It is sad and unfortunate that the BJP has for the first time politicized our armed forces,"" said state Congress committee chief Kishor Upadhyay to NDTV. The irony however is that Chief Minister Harish Rawat himself recently declared a proposal for the opening of a ministry for soldiers and ex-servicemen by March 2017 if elected to power.

""I don't believe the promises that either government makes,"" says an irate Brig. KG Behl, former president of the Uttarakhand Ex-Servicemen League. ""Despite the fact that we constitute about 30 per cent of the state, our people are still very divided. There was once even a proposal of forming a different political a party for soldiers but it fizzled out,"" said the retired Brigadier.

""I feel that by and large people will be attracted to the amount of OROP and surgical strikes but it will be limited to ex-servicemen in urban areas. In rural areas, where people still don't know about the importance of OROP because they don't have TVs, the pattern of voting will be different,"" said Col. PL Prashar, also from the UESL."

All those who queued up till 5 pm will be allowed to vote, election officials said from Chandigarh.

Brisk voting was reported in the state's Malwa belt, south of the Sutlej river, with 69 out of the 117 assembly seats and decisive for any party's victory. The Akali Dal, Congress and new entrant Aam Aadmi Party are locked in a bitter contest.

The Majha (north of river Beas) and Doaba (area between Beas and Sutlej rivers) belts were catching up in voting percentage, election officials said. Amritsar and Ropar districts recorded the lowest turnout at less than 60 per cent till 5 pm.

For the first time, Punjab witnessed three-cornered contests on all seats, between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The enthusiasm of voters was almost equal in rural and urban areas.

First-time voters were issued certificates by district authorities in various constituencies.

Among early voters were former Army chief Gen JJ Singh (Patiala city) of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and former Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal (Badal village) of the Congress.

Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, 89, his son and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and daughter-in-law and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal cast their votes in Badal village, which is part of Mr Badal senior's Lambi assembly constituency.

""We will win easily. Punjab is looking forward to peace and development,"" the Chief Minister said after voting.

Mr Badal is being challenged for the Lambi seat by Punjab Congress President and former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and AAP's Jarnail Singh.

Sukhbir Badal is facing a challenge from two sitting MPs - Bhagwant Mann (AAP) and Ravneet Singh Bittu (Congress), for the Jalalabad assembly seat.

Amarinder Singh, accompanied by his wife and former Union Minister of State for External Affairs Preneet Kaur, and other family members, voted in Patiala city.

""I am sure that we (Congress) are winning this election comfortably,"" Mr Singh told media.

Others to cast their votes included cricketer-turned-politician and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu (Amritsar-east), former Olympian and now Congress leader Pargat Singh (Jalandhar Cantt), Sucha Singh Chhotepur (Gurdaspur) of Apna Punjab Party and Congress leaders Sunil Jakhar (Aboha) and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal (Lehra).

Cricketer Harbhajan Singh and Sufi singer Hans Raj Hans voted in polling stations in Jalandhar.

Tight security arrangements were in place across Punjab, with over 100,000 security personnel deployed, and borders with neighbouring states sealed.

"Goa Elections 2017: Why BJP's Michael Lobo, Who Once Washed Dishes, Is Sure He Will Win","http://www.ndtv.com/goa-news/goa-elections-2017-why-bjps-michael-lobo-who-once-washed-dishes-is-sure-he-will-win-1655420","Panaji:                             Michael Lobo, BJP legislator from Goa's Calangute, is the envy of voters in neighbouring constituencies. His supporters believe the ruling party, which has not named a chief ministerial candidate for Goa, will do well to project the 40-year-old for the top post.
   
""I know I'm popular because I'm a man from Goa. I interact with people and know about their problems. I'll win with full majority. You can interview me again on the March 11"", he told NDTV.


Michael Lobo's popularity in the constituency is built around his reputation as a hands-on MLA. He stands at the site to inspect all work on roads, an important agenda in Goa.

""I am a builder myself. I make sure I keep an eye on the work myself. Engineers can be lazy sometimes,"" Mr Lobo said.

Mr Lobo is also credited with getting Goa its first state-of-the-art solid waste treatment plant as garbage management has been an issue in the state.

""I started working when I was 13. My father was unwell and I had to support my family. I dropped out after first year because I didn't have enough money, but made sure my elder sister completed her graduation"", Mr Lobo said.

He washed dishes at a restaurant, became a waiter before becoming a manager. Today, he owns three resorts and six restaurants in the Baga-Calangute area.

Michael Lobo is credited with getting Goa its first state of the art solid waste treatment plant.

""He is always available for us. Other constituencies are jealous because we have an MLA like him,"" said Harry Masparenhas, 52, who owns a small eatery near Baga.

""He will be the next Chief Minister,"" said another worker.

The BJP, which hopes to get reelected in Goa, had dropped hints that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, Goa's most popular BJP man, could return if the party is elected to power again. In Calangute, residents say if Mr Parrikar does not return, Michael Lobo would be a better pick rather than Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, who took charge when Mr Parrikar was called to Delhi on national duty."
"Punjab Elections 2017: 35 Per Cent Voter Turnout Across State Till 1 PM","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-elections-2017-35-per-cent-voter-turnout-in-punjab-till-1-pm-1655999","Chandigarh:                             Brisk polling was going on as around 35 per cent of the total 1.98 crore electors exercised their franchise till 1 PM in the high-stakes Punjab Assembly elections, wherein 1,145 candidates are in the fray.

""35 per cent polling has taken place till 1 PM,"" an election office spokesman said in Chandigarh. ""Polling is going peacefully,"" Additional Director General of Police (ADGP-elections) VK Bhawra said.

Meanwhile, a technical snag was reported in voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines in Majitha and Sangrur, the spokesman said, adding that the matter had been referred to the Election Commission. Voting started around 45 minutes late at two polling booths in Jalandhar and Amritsar due to technical glitches in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).

Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia was unable to cast his vote in the morning due to the technical snag in EVM at polling station number 35, Ward number 5 in Majitha constituency in Amritsar district.

Among those who had cast their vote so far included Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, his wife and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Congress vetran Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.

Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh and his wife Preneet Kaur had also cast their votes.

""Seeking my mother's blessings before casting my vote. Let this be a new dawn for Punjab!"" Amarinder Singh tweeted.

Former Army chief General JJ Singh (retd) of the Akali Dal, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pargat Singh of Congress, Sucha Singh Chhotepur of Apna Punjab Party (APP), and Bhagwant Mann, Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi and Sukhpal Singh Khaira of the Aam Aadmi Party also cast their votes.

Cricketer Harbhajan Singh along with his mother Avtar Kaur also exercised their franchise. The polling for 117 Punjab assembly seats is being held in a single phase amid tight security.

Punjab is witnessing a three-cornered contest between ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance, opposition Congress and new entrant Aam Aadmi Party.

Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has fielded candidates in 94 seats while its ally BJP has nominated candidates in the remaining 23 seats. Congress is contesting alone on all seats. AAP, which is contesting the state polls for the first time, has fielded candidates in 112 seats while its ally Lok Insaf Party, led by Ludhiana-based Bains brothers, has fielded nominees in five seats.

Other political outfits in the fray include BSP, former AAP leader Sucha Singh Chhotepur-led Apna Punjab Party, the Left comprising CPI and CPI-M, and SAD-Amritsar.

Over 200 companies of paramilitary forces have been deputed for the fair conduct of polls.

Voting for Amritsar Lok Sabha seat by-poll is also being held amid tight security arrangements.

The total number of electors in the state is 1,98,79,069, including 93,75,546 females. There are 415 transgender voters.

The total number of candidates in the fray include 81 women and a transgender. The polling commenced at 22,615 polling stations in the entire state.

While 84 Assembly seats are of general category, 34 are reserved.

Speaking to reporters after casting his vote at Lambi, 89-year-old five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said, ""I have 70 years of experience and have fought for Punjab and India. This is a small battle.""

His comment came when asked about the electoral battle turning into a triangular contest this time with the entry of Aam Aadmi Party.

""We will have a bigger win than last time. AAP will finish at third spot,"" Sukhbir Badal claimed. ""People will vote for development, peace and communal harmony. AAP is a pack of criminals,"" he added.

Punjab Congress president and party's chief ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh said his party was leading in the state and was set to form the government. The senior Congress leader, who is contesting from Lambi, said he would defeat Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal in the latter's turf.

""This time three major parties are in the fray. I wish that whoever wins keep Punjab's interests above all,"" cricketer Harbhajan Singh told reporters in his hometown Jalandhar. He also appealed that more and more youth should come out to cast their votes.

General JJ Singh (retd) said SAD-BJP will perform a hat-trick and form the government.

Navjot Singh Sidhu, who along with his wife Navjot Kaur cast his vote, said, ""People of Punjab will give a gift to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi by ensuring party's victory here and its revival in the country.""

""Truth will prevail in Punjab...from this place Congress flag will start floating,"" he said.

The key contestants in the crucial state polls include Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh (Patiala and Lambi seats), Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal (Lambi) and his son Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal (Jalalabad).

The other prominent candidates are Congress veteran and former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal (Lehragagga), Indian Youth Congress chief Raja Amarinder Singh Warring (Gidderbaha), Badal's estranged nephew Manpreet Singh Badal, who is fighting on a Congress ticket from Bathinda Urban, and AAP MP Bhagwant Mann (Jalalabad).

Amritsar Lok Sabha seat fell vacant following the resignation of Amarinder Singh to protest the Supreme Court verdict on Punjab's river waters. The voter strength in this seat is over 14 lakhs.

Prominent among the candidates in fray for the Lok Sabha seat are BJP leader Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, who is up against Congress' Gurjit Singh Aujla and Aam Aadmi Party's Upkar Singh Sandhu.

For the Amritsar Lok Sabha by-poll, 35 per cent polling has taken place so far, an election office spokesman said here.

The counting of votes for the state polls and Amritsar Lok Sabha by-poll will take place on March 11.

Meanwhile, in Moga, the police booked Independent candidate Manjit Singh Mann under the provisions of the Representation of the People's Act and relevant sections of IPC, for allegedly campaigning even after the deadline for the same had ended, Moga's Returning Officer said.

Two ailing women voters, Raj Rani (78) and Bimla Devi (80), came in an ambulance to exercise their right of vote in Phagwara. While one was taken on a stretcher, the other was taken on wheelchair to Booth No 158 near old Dana mandi in Phagwara.

Talking to reporters later, the women said they had arranged for ambulances themselves. They urged the Election Commission to make separate and priority arrangements for the ailing voters.

In Fazilka, state police personnel gave roses to first ten voters."
"Varun Gandhi Back On BJP List Of 40 Star Attractions In UP. At Number 39","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-back-on-bjp-list-of-40-star-attractions-in-up-at-number-39-1655361","Lucknow:                             Varun Gandhi, excluded from the BJP's list of ""star campaigners"" in Uttar Pradesh for the first two phases of the assembly elections, is back on the list for the third and fourth phases. So is former state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar whose comments last week about Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and later about Smriti Irani of his own party were slammed as ""sexist.""

Varun Gandhi is number 39 on the list of 40 that every party has to submit to the Election Commission for each phase of elections, and the inclusion is seen as a conciliatory move. Mr Gandhi, 36, does not enjoy a happy equation with BJP chief Amit Shah and has been sulking with the party leadership, which he believes has not backed him after allegations were made last year that he had been honey-trapped and blackmailed into leaking crucial information.

But, said sources, after a rough time with rebellion in the ranks over the BJP fielding a number of people it has recently poached from other parties and from the supporters of another rebellious lawmaker Yogi Adityanath, the party wants no more trouble.

Varun Gandhi is the BJP lawmaker from UP's Sultanpur, which votes only in the fifth phase of the seven-part UP elections, but has considerable influence in pockets of Western UP like Saharanpur and in Pilibhit, his mother's Lok Sabha constituency, which vote in the first two phases.

Mr Gandhi's supporters are bristling at the snub to their leader, at one time talked about as a potential chief ministerial candidate, and the BJP wants to avoid a sabotage attempt when campaigning is at a peak especially in the sensitive western UP which will vote in the first phase on February 11.

The new list of key campaigners is led, like the first, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Veteran leader and the BJP's member of Parliament from Kanpur Murli Manohar Joshi makes a comeback - his omission from the first list along with that of party patriarch LK Advani for the first time ever had raised eyebrows.

Kanpur votes in the third phase. Mr Advani does not feature in this list of star campaigners either."

"AAP Has Max Chance Of Winning Punjab: Prannoy Roy's Analysis","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-has-voted-who-won-prannoy-roys-forecast-today-1656070","New Delhi:                             Around 1.4 crore people in Punjab voted for their 117-member assembly today. Some 1,100 candidates had their fates sealed in the crucial election that saw a three-way contest between the ruling Akali Dal-BJP alliance, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, which debuted in the state polls this time. The 2017 Punjab elections saw several high-octane contests with incumbent Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal taking on his predecessor, Congress' Amarinder Singh, in the former's constituency of Lambi, and AAP lawmaker Bhagwant Mann challenging Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal for the latter's Jalalabad seat. Former BJP lawmaker Navjot Singh Sidhu also contested as a Congress candidate from Amritsar East. The Congress seeks to regain the state from the SAD-BJP alliance, which has ruled Punjab for nearly a decade, while the AAP - which won all of its four Lok Sabha seats in 2014 from the state - expects to make a smashing foray.

Join Dr Prannoy Roy, Dorab Sopariwala and Shekhar Gupta as they identify and analyse the issues and mood of the voters from Punjab.

Prannoy Roy: A fascinating election to cover, one of the best I have ever done. Could this be the end of polling here too after Brexit, and US?

What pollsters say about who Punjab has chosen
 

Prannoy Roy: So we went on a trip across the state. Now we are in one the 'predictor constituencies' Bassi Pathana which seem to always pick the winner. So here is our forecast after speaking to hundreds of people.

Our first forecast said Congress had best chance now we say AAP has 55-60% chance of winning. Our first estimates were based on studying opinion polls but now we have gone around the state and spoken to more people and based on these inputs this is what we conclude.
 
Shekhar Gupta: Nobody is shy to say they are voting for change.

Prannoy Roy: There is a lot of unhappiness a lot of issues fuelling discontent. Here are the reasons

Key issues influencing the vote in Punjab
 
Prannoy Roy: Where is the AAP is going to get its vote from? AAP takes a lot of the Akali foundation away. AAP is weaker in Hindu areas, strong in Sikh areas. It did very well in East Malwa region. Here's how the political parties map looks like.

From 2012 to 2014 - How Aam Aadmi Party has changed the equation in Punjab
 
Shekhar Gupta: This is a very impatient electorate. Another reason for Akali's collapse is that over the past 10 years it has transformed from a democratic party to a dynastic party. The incidents of desecration and the fact that the guilty weren't caught angered the public.

How different regions in the state have previously voted in Punjab's assembly elections this year
 
Dorab Sopariwala: For the first time, I saw signs of despair in Punjab. Many people are voting for AAP are saying, ""What do we have to lose?""

Shekhar Gupta: But this despair is not for destitution though. It's for jobs and other issues.

Shekhar Gupta: For many people, voting for AAP is a gamble. They are willing to take a risk

Prannoy Roy: Another important factor in Punjab is the Dalit vote because they form a large part of the population.

Why the Dalit vote in crucial
 
Prannoy Roy: That's why there are 54 swing seats - very few seats are safe.
 
Shekhar Gupta: There is resentment about one family's rule in Punjab.

Prannoy Roy: People seem to trust Kejriwal. A party without a leader has come so ahead

Shekhar Gupta: AAP has gone beyond the identity. People don't care who is the party chief or who will be the chief minister they are voting for issues.

Shekhar Gupta: This election is about a CRY - Change, Revolt and Youth

Prannoy Roy to Arvind Kejriwal: How many seats will you win?

Arvind Kejriwal: More than 100 seats.
 
Dorab Sopariwala: It isn't just a support for AAP. It's a frenzy.

Shekhar Gupta: AAP seems to have co-opted patriotism. They don't have their own iconography so they have invoked people like Bhagat Singh, Rajguru.

Shekhar Gupta: I have not seen a Hindu leader get this kind of adulation in Punjab even counting Indira Gandhi in pre - Bhindranwale days

Prannoy Roy: So how does age divide, and the urban-rural divide affect the vote?
 
Prannoy Roy: People are saying there is a huge wave for the AAP in the pind or the villages but in cities there is still respect for the Congress.

Amarinder Singh to NDTV: AAP is not a problem for us. They were a problem two years ago when they were new, but their magic seems to have worn off as people have seen their functioning in Delhi. Sonia Gandhi is not Sikh but she made a Sikh party president here. AAP could have done that.
 
AAP's support comes not from Sikhs but from youth. Youth is frustrated, they want change, a new alternative. If I don't win, this is my last election. I have said that before. I am 75.

Sukhbir Singh Badal to NDTV: This a true story about us. We are not like Kejriwal who says something and does something else. Why I say Kejriwal is a useless and dangerous character because we have been through very bad terrorism. The people who are responsible are the people he is meeting. He is meeting people of Babbar Khalsa.  International people have breakfast with them because he wants to be a Chief Minister, so that he can get after PM Modi. His mission is only Modi.

He just wants to attack Mr Modi and wants that if I do that I will become a national figure.
 
(If AAP wins) It will be the worst thing in the history of Punjab because all criminal elements, all forces which are responsible to bring them to power will go back with them.

Captain Amarinder Singh will be number 3 in that (Lambi) constituency. Parkash Singh Badal will win with a majority of more 35,000 votes. Captain will be number 3.

Punjab recorded 70 per cent voter turnout today, here's how different age groups have voted in past
 
Prannoy Roy: Going by the trends, there seems to be a victory for AAP. The question is will it be a landslide."

"Uttarakhand Elections 2017: The Strategy Behind Harish Rawat Filing Nomination From 2 Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-chief-minister-harish-rawat-files-nomination-from-haridwar-rural-signalling-the-start-of-1653473","Haridwar:                             For Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, the last day of nominations brought with it a historic 'first'. After filing his nomination from Kichcha on Tuesday, the Chief Minister on Friday filed his nomination from Haridwar Rural, one of the 11 assembly seats in Haridwar district, where he won the Lok Sabha polls in 2009.

With this, Mr Rawat becomes the first state chief minister to be fielded from two assembly constituencies in Uttarakhand, something he claims, is a strategic imperative.

""These two districts (Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar) are the pillars of our states' development. Out of 70 seats, 20 seats are in these two districts so it is a sizeable share"", the chief minister told NDTV.

The last one week has seen the chief minister travel over 400 kilometres across Uttarakhand where he has been leading the Uttarakhand Swabhimaan Yatra to reclaim the spirit of the state dogged by the political instability of the past two years.

""For the last two and a half years I have had a terrible time. I have had to compromise on many counts,"" said Mr Rawat, who was made chief minister in 2014 after the untimely expulsion of Vijay Bahuguna, his predecessor, over the mishandling of relief operations in the aftermath of the 2013 Kedarnath disaster.

Mr Bahuguna, along with senior leaders like Harak Singh Rawat, Subodh Uniyal and Yashpal Arya, to name a few, form part of a group of leaders that has since defected to the BJP leaving the ruling Congress in disarray. But Mr Rawat doesn't think so.

""After these defectors I feel at least I will be able to perform to my fullest now,"" said Mr Rawat.

Vote-shares and seat distribution are major concerns for the Congress party that currently has only two elected members from the 20 seats in Haridwar and Udhum Singh Nagar. A large number of these seats were earlier held by the 'turncoat' leaders, 10 of whom have been fielded by the opposition BJP in the forthcoming elections.

Asked if he felt a threat from his own former colleagues, now rivals, Mr Rawat said, ""It is the primary duty of a CM to maintain a majority in the secretariat and I have lived up to that. People often wonder what is Harish Rawat's formula. But if the people of the state feel I should deliver, they should give me a clear mandate. This election is as much about prestige as it is about leadership"", said the 69-year-old chief minister.

According to Mr Rawat, the price of the political instability in the state in former months has been paid by the development process. ""Modiji came to Dehradun. But it seems like he finds it hard to admit our concerns in Delhi. Our proposal to develop an SEZ in the Bhagirathi valley has been stalled by the centre,"" he said.

In the same breath, the chief minister adds, ""I respect and admire Narendra Modi; I am only a small chief minister of a small state. Modiji talks about cooperative federalism, I would like to tell him that we are also part of that team.""

So what is Harish Rawat's immediate vision for the state? ""If elected, I promise a government that is 'bhrashtachar mukt aur rozgar yukt' (corruption free and employment generating),"" he says.

""The Congress has decided to include in its manifesto that by 2020, a job will be given to one member of every family. By 2020 we will also ensure that one woman of every household is linked to a bank in terms of employment. We want to create a model of human development which will make our little hill-state an ideal model,"" Mr Rawat adds.

""People should vote keeping in mind their future but also the challenges we have had to face in the past. There were so many attempts to derail us. Some would even call them sabotage. We have weathered the storms,"" he says.

Uttarakhand goes to polls on February 15 in a contest where both the ruling Congress and the BJP will contest for 70 seats. The test will be crucial for the Congress, which has been in power since 2012 but has yet produced only one chief minister who has lasted a full five year term. The last and only chief minister to have lasted a full five year term was ND Tiwari, a Congress chief minister with a term from 2002 to 2007."

""According to the party high command, Congress will contest all the 10 seats in Amethi and Raebareli,"" said Congress leader Sanjay Singh, who heads the campaign committee of the party.

Fielding of candidates in Amethi and Raebareli was one of the issues of contention between Congress and Samajwadi Party during their talks to forge the pre-poll alliance.

Mr Singh claimed that Samajwadi Party had assured Congress that it (Congress) will contest on all the 10 seats in these Lok Sabha constituencies of the Congress vice president and the party president, respectively.

""Congress will contest on all the seats and the party is firm on this resolve,"" he stressed.

To a question on BJP fielding his estranged first wife Garima Singh from Amethi, Mr Singh said the party has ""ignored its committed workers and given ticket to a candidate who is neither recognised nor has had any relation with the people of Amethi"".

He went on to add that ""Amethi has only one 'Rani' (queen) who is Amita Singh (his present wife) and had long been preparing ground for contesting from Amethi Assembly seat"".

As per its alliance pact with Samajwadi Party, the Congress will contest 105 out of 403 seats of the UP Assembly."

Earlier, the Reserve Bank of India had refused to enhance the cash withdrawal limit for election candidates despite a request from the poll commission. But today, the central bank removed cash withdrawal limits from current accounts, cash credit accounts and overdraft accounts with immediate effect. The commission's advisory came immediately after.

Earlier, the Election Commission had instructed candidates to open a separate bank account for elections. A majority of candidates had opened current accounts.

Last week, the commission had written to the central bank, asking that the weekly cash withdrawal limit, which was Rs. 24,000, be increased to Rs. 2 lakh for candidates up for election in the five states. The bank had pointed out that though the government allows candidates to spend above Rs. 20 lakh, given the withdrawal limits, they would be able to spend less than Rs. 1 lakh before the elections begin.

The expenditure limits are capped at Rs. 28 lakh for Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and Rs. 20 lakh for Manipur and Goa.

The central bank, however, turned down the Commission, saying a special provision was not possible at the moment. The Commission had hit back, saying the RBI apparently ""has not realised the gravity of the situation"". ""It is reiterated that it is the constitutional mandate of the commission to conduct free and fair elections and to provide level playing field to all candidates,"" the Commission said, insisting that its directions be complied with.

Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur begin on February 4. The results will be announced on March 11."

Mr Rana, an accused in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and the party candidate from Thana Bhawan seat in neighbouring Shamli district, had made the remarks at a gathering in his constituency on Saturday, evoking criticism from opposition.

""If I emerge as the winner (in UP polls), curfew will be imposed in Kairana, Deoband and Moradabad,"" he said.

A case was registered against Mr Rana under IPC Section 505 (Making a statement with intent to incite) and Section 125 (Promoting enmity between classes in connection with election) of The Representation of the People Act for his controversial remarks, Thana Bhawan circle officer Sunil Kumar Tyagi said.

The officer said that it was found that the MLA's statement violated the model code of conduct for elections.

Mr Rana today claimed that his remarks were meant for people who have spread terror in the state.

""What I meant was many people have planned to leave western UP fearing the terror spread by goons and robbers. There is no city in that region where people have not planned to move out due to the fear of these goons,"" Mr Rana said.

""...when BJP forms government in UP, these goons who are part of the mafia, whose actions are feared and who forced residents to flee will have to leave the state. The residents of UP won't leave due to fear. The goons will have to leave the state,"" he added.

Hitting out at Mr Rana, SP leader Juhi Singh said, ""What does he want to do by imposing a curfew, he does not seem educated even to know when a curfew is imposed"".

BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi sought to distance from the MLA's remarks saying ""the party is not responsible if a candidate says something"".

""PM Modi and Amit Shah are saying that such statements should not be made. I don't know in what context he (Rana) has said it but I understand that our party is contesting the UP elections on the development plank,"" Ms Joshi said.

Mr Rana has also been booked for allegedly violating the model code of conduct after he held a public gathering and took out a road show at Hathi Karonda village in his constituency in Shamli district yesterday without the permission of the authorities, police said."

""We are not giving (Congress) a clean chit. We are choosing the lesser evil,"" Mr Khan said, referring to the Samajwadi Party's criticism of the Congress on various issues in the past. He also said that this is not a time to discuss such things, which could be answered after the elections.

""There was an experience in Bihar of a mahagathbandhan. That experiment in Bihar succeeded and there was a view among common people that there could be a coalition of like-minded people and they should come together and contest elections,"" the senior leader said to news agency Press Trust of India.

Mr Khan added that the Congress was a prominent force in the Indian independence movement and the Muslim community has had a long association with the party.

The Samajwadi Party leader further said that he does not know what compelled the Congress to form a coalition with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and the ""very agenda of BJP is against the weak, Dalits, backward and minorities"".

Mr Khan also criticised the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party and said that her party should give all 403 seats to Muslim candidates if they want to win over the community.(with inputs from PTI)"

While releasing the manifesto, called 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra' (Pledge for People's Welfare), the BJP president said the party will form the government in Uttar Pradesh with a two-thirds majority. He attacked the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party which have ruled Uttar Pradesh for the last 15 years, accusing them of doing nothing to develop it. The BJP, he said, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would turn UP into a developed state, the way it has other states it rules. The BJP is attempting to return to power in UP after 15 years. In 2012 it had won only 47 of the state's 403 seats, but in the national election of 2014 it swept 71 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats and hopes to extend that performance to this year's assembly election.

Here are the highlights of his speech:The country's biggest state is going to polls.BJP workers have organised public meetings in corners of the state.According to the feedback, BJP is going to form the government with 2/3rd majority.We have tried to understand what people want from the next UP government.We have taken the feedback of about 30 lakh people through missed calls, letters, etc.Prime Minister after his many rallies was sure that people will being BJP in power in UP.SP and BSP have formed governments for 15 years. In that time other states, more backward than UP, have developed.We were sent to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh etc and they are not BIMAARU states anymore.I don't have any qualms in saying that I want to thank the people of UP for giving us 72 of 80 seats. We wouldn't have made a majority govt at the Centre. But it is unfortunate that even with central govt, we can't do much for UP.PM is a parliamentarian from UP. All the schemes are ready but aren't being implemented in UP.Many mafia groups have made life difficult for UP.If a state differentiates on the basis of their vote banks, they can't get justice for all citizens.The election is going to take place after the notes ban. We have faith that the kind of war BJP and PM have launched on black money. UP will show us the results.We have not indulged in politics of caste and religion, we have done the politics of performance.The BJP, after many discussions, have divided the manifesto in 9 parts.The farmer in UP is suffering. The BJP has decided to waive off all farmer loans. The farmers will get further loans with 0 per cent interest.In the next 5 years, a 150 crore fund will be set up for agricultural development.Bundelkhand will get special preference.We will follow the motto of Na Goondaraj Na Bhrashtachar. In 45 days, we will bring all criminals, who are out on paroles and committing crimes, back to jails.FIRs for all citizens will be filed without caste bias.Land mafia has troubled the entire state. We have decided to set up a task force in every district to tackle different mafias.Class 4 and class 5 employees will be hired only on the basis of merit, interviews will be quashed.We will provide a 1,000 crore start-up capital fund.90 per cent of the jobs will be given to youth of UPLaptops distributed till now have been caste-based. We will give laptops without any bias with free 1 GB internet per month.We will allocate Rs. 500 crore for the Baba Ambedkar fund.All colleges and universities will have free Wi-Fi. All students scoring about 50 per cent will get free education till graduation.Up to 6 lakh loan from permanent houses and toilets. BPL citizens to get 2 lakh life cover.24x7 electricity in all houses. PM has said before 2019, all villages will have electricity. In the next five years, we will get toilets in every house, LPG in every house and pipelines for cities.Villages will be connected with mini-bus services.People will be able to use metro at any time with their families, unlike now.There will be a Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal fund for development.Redressal system in every district to sort our trader disputes.Rs. 5,000 for every girl child born in poor families; No age bar for widow pensions.We will take the opinion of all women on Triple Talaq and place it in front of Supreme Court.On Ram Temple, we will follow the law and get the temple build as soon as possible.I hope UP will be free of caste based politics and nepotism. UP's development is necessary for country's development. We have taken feedback from the people of UP.I hope UP's 20 crore people will give its blessings and BJP will form a majority government with 300 or more seats."

This comes a day after the Prime Minister campaigned in Punjab's Jalandhar alongwith the state's Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal.

Prime Minister Modi is expected to highlight the achievements of the BJP-led government in the state over five years and criticise the Congress and the AAP - which has fielded former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate.

""The Congress is in a real bad shape. They are being opportunistic,"" the Prime Minister said yesterday in Jalandhar.

""They can go to any extent for the power of the chair,"" he further said.

Earlier during the day, the Prime Minister also addressed NCC officers and cadets at a rally in New Delhi.

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, who is currently on a three-day visit to Punjab, is expected to rally in Goa on January 30.

Former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar was inducted by PM Modi into the Union Cabinet as Defence Minister in 2014. Following Mr Parrikar's induction, the BJP appointed Laxmikant Parsekar as chief minister. Earlier this month, Mr Parrikar said that Goa's chief minister should be ""young at heart"", even if slightly ""elder"".

Rumours of the Defence Minister making a return to state politics are strong after BJP president Amit Shah announced that the next government in Goa would function under the leadership of Mr Parrikar, should the BJP retain power in the state.  

The BJP has already announced 36 contestants for the 40-member legislative assembly in Goa. The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, which - until recently- was an alliance partner in the state, has decided to sever ties with the BJP.

Exuding confidence of a ""Congress sweep"" in the polls, Mr Singh negated any threat from either the AAP or the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), saying he did not see them securing ""more than 25 and 12 seats respectively"".

""The Congress would win the remaining seats hands down,"" he said, adding that the party would emerge victorious from all the four seats in Moga district, while the SAD would ""trail heavily"" even in their strongholds of Lambi and Jalalabad -- the seats of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal respectively.

Mr Singh alleged that Mr Sukhbir's own constituency of Jalalabad was in a ""big mess"" due to ""no development"" since the deputy chief minister had been ""busy all these years looting the state"".

He came down heavily on Parkash Singh Badal for the ""growing religious intolerance and incidents of sacrilege"" in Punjab, promising to put him behind bars after getting all the cases of desecration re-investigated.

Mr Singh promised to ""free"" the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) from the ""shackles of the Badals"", who had ""transformed it into their personal fiefdom for political exploitation"" and reiterated his support for anyone standing up against the Badals in the SGPC.

Addressing public rallies in support of Congress candidates Rajwinder Kaur Bhagike and Harchand Kaur from Nihal Singh Wala and Mehal Kalan constituencies respectively, Amarinder claimed that the AAP, ""with its Haryanvi leader and outsider base"", was not in a position to provide stable governance in Punjab, which he said could not afford to experiment with a new dispensation in the midst of the ""ongoing crisis"".

The former Punjab chief minister, gearing up for the last poll battle of his long political career, referred to reports of a large number of ""outsiders"" being brought in by the AAP for its roadshow in Patiala to caution the people against being taken in by Mr Kejriwal's ""false promises"".

Mr Singh vowed to throw behind bars Akali leaders such as Bikram Singh Majithia and Tota Singh, who had ""destroyed the lives of lakhs with their drug mafia and food scams"""

""It appears that the RBI has not realised the gravity of the situation... It is reiterated that it is the constitutional mandate of the commission to conduct free and fair elections and to provide level playing field to all candidates. In order to facilitate proper conduct of elections, it is imperative that directions issued by the commission are complied with,"" the poll authority said in a fresh letter to RBI chief Urjit Patel expressing ""serious concern"" over the bank's response.

The commission had on Wednesday requested the RBI to enhance the withdrawal limit for candidates from 24,000 to 2 lakhs rupees per week to help them meet their campaign expenditure. The weekly cash withdrawal limit set after the Nov 8 notes ban - which preceded a massive cash crunch across the country - has not been increased.

Assembly elections in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - begin from February 4. The poll panel wants the facility to be provided till results are announced on March 11.

The commission said the returning officer of the constituency would issue certificate of a person's candidacy which would allow him/her to withdraw the extra cash from bank accounts opened especially to meet poll expenses, which the commission said it monitors.

The poll panel has now asked the central bank to reconsider the request.

It reminded the central bank that as per law, candidates contesting assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab can spend Rs. 28 lakh each for electioneering. The limit in Goa and Manipur is Rs. 20 lakh each.

The poll panel argued that despite paying amounts through cheques, candidates still need hard cash for petty expenses, especially in rural areas where banking facilities are limited.

Eyewitnesses said that the white Maruti 800 car, in which the blast took place, was parked at the spot for some time and no one removed it despite police making announcements to get it removed.

Some alleged that a few shots were also fired towards Mr Jassi's car.

The eyewitnesses said that a pressure cooker, filled with iron nails and other metallic things, was found lying near the car.

The car, in which the blast took place, was completely destroyed in the incident.

Police officials rushed to the spot and were investigating the incident. They did not rule out conspiracy behind the incident.

Punjab will vote for a new government on Friday."
"Battleground Punjab With Prannoy Roy: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-battleground-punjab-with-prannoy-roy-1655069","The upcoming Punjab assembly election, scheduled for February 4, is expected to be an intense three-way battle between the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance, the Congress and the debutante Aam Aadmi Party. The state will witness several high-octane contests wherein incumbent Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal will take on his predecessor, Congress' Amarinder Singh, in the former's constituency of Lambi, and AAP MP Bhagwant Mann will challenge Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal for the latter's Jalalabad seat. Former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu will also contest as a Congress candidate from Amritsar East. The Congress seeks to regain the state from the SAD-BJP alliance, which has ruled Punjab for nearly a decade, while the AAP - which won all of its four Lok Sabha seats in 2014 from the state - expects to make quite a debut.

Join Dr Prannoy Roy, Dorab Sopariwala, Shekhar Gupta and Amitoj Singh as they identify and analyse the issues and mood of the voters from the Golden Temple in Punjab.Here are the highlights from the show:

Prannoy Roy: Welcome to Battleground Punjab. You might be wondering why I am wearing a turban. It's because I am sardar at heart.The AAP got 24 per cent votes in 2014.
 
Prannoy Roy: There are four regions : East Malwa, West Malwa, Dwab and Majha. Hindus are in the northeast and Sikhs in the rest of the state. But it is not a communal state. It is a harmonious state.
 Shekhar Gupta: It is a very urbanised state.
 
Prannoy Roy: The Sikh vote leans for Akalis. For Hindus, it is exactly the other way round.
Amitoj Singh: I think the AAP floundered a bit. They realised they will need Sikh leadership if they want to fight elections in Punjab.
Prannoy Roy: Rural Sikhs vote quite a bit more for the Akalis than the urban Sikh.
 
Shekhar Gupta: East Malwa (where AAP has gained) has always been a rebellious region.
 
Dorab Sopariwala: The incumbent has got the support of the Dera Sacha Sauda.
Prannoy Roy: There is a huge urban rural divide.
 Amitoj Singh: You can see the age difference in the AAP and Akali rallies. AAP voters are young.
Shekhar Gupta: The most anti-Congress party in the country is the Akali Dal.
Prannoy Roy: The Congress vote goes up as Hindu population goes up. Where does the AAP get its vote from? 45 per cent from Akalis, 35 per cent from Congress and 20 per cent from others.Dorab Sopariwala: Poverty in Punjab is very different. Its mostly about the lack of jobs.

Shekhar Gupta: It's very credible how quickly AAP has been able to set up a party organisation and a cadre in Punjab.

Amitoj Singh: Drugs doesn't really come up in Akali campaigning. They just say some people are trying to give Punjab a bad name.

Shekhar Gupta: Congress hopes that Akalis can hold on to their base because those votes will go to AAP.
Prannoy Roy: Who will win Punjab? Congress 45 per cent, AAP 35 per cent, Akali+ 20 per cent.
 Dorab Sopariwala: There seems to be an anger in Punjab against the government that we haven't seen before.

Prannoy Roy: There is a 32 per cent Dalit vote here. Dalit Sikhs vote much more for Akalis. Hindu Dalits vote a little more for the Congress. It's great to see the election here is not about hatred. Religion plays a very small role in politics here.
 Amitoj Singh: The seat in Majitha is one to watch out for. AAP's candidate there may be their CM candidate. Sources say there is not a single constituency that AAP wants more than Majitha.
 Prannoy Roy: It is a fascinating election."
"Bathinda Blast: Death Toll Rises To 6, Police Seek NSG Help","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bathinda-blast-death-toll-rises-to-6-police-seek-nsg-help-1655084","Bathinda:                             The death toll in the Maur Mandi blast rose to six today with three children succumbing to injuries, even as police suspected the use of IED and sought NSG support in probe into the explosion which has triggered a political blame game just days ahead of Assembly polls, scheduled for February 4.

Three persons were killed yesterday in the explosion near the venue of the poll campaign of Congress candidate Harminder Singh Jassi at Maur Mandi.

""One more child has succumbed to injuries at CMC hospital in Ludhiana,"" Bathinda Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said today, adding, the victim has been identified as 13-year-old Saurabh Singla.

Earlier, Ripandeep, 9, and Japsimran, 14, died at the CMC hospital where they were admitted. Thirteen injured - three of them critical - are undergoing treatment at different hospitals.

Punjab DGP Suresh Arora along with other senior police officials today inspected the blast site. He said it was an ""unfortunate incident"".

Mr Arora said the Home Ministry has been requested to send experts of NSG to identify the material used in the explosion.

Asked whether the IED was used to carry out the blast, the DGP said one pressure cooker exploded in this incident while another was found at the spot. A forensic team has reached the site to probe the matter, he said.

On ""terror angle"", he said, ""Stating that this (terror) angle is not possible, it will be wrong to say at this moment. We are not ruling this possibility.""

Asked whether there was any input on the possibility of such a blast, the DGP said, ""In the context of Punjab, there is always suspicion that anything could happen. That is why strict security arrangements were done... And now this incident happened.""

Meanwhile, the Election Commission has sought a report from Punjab Police on the car explosion.

Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal condemned the blast and urged people to exercise calm and said those involved in it would be dealt with severely.

""Nobody would be allowed to disturb the hard-earned peace and communal harmony in the state,"" he had said earlier in the day.

AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal demanded immediate arrest of SAD chief and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal to ensure peaceful elections.

""To ensure peaceful elections, Sukhbir Badal should be immediately arrested. His role in yesterday's blast be probed. He'll cause more violence,"" Kejriwal tweeted.

Meanwhile, Congress Punjab chief Amarinder Singh blamed Mr Kejriwal for the explosion alleging that he had been promoting extremist forces like Khalistan Commando Force in the state."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: Sidelined By Akhilesh Yadav, Uncle Shivpal Yadav Plans New Party","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sidelined-by-akhilesh-yadav-uncle-shivpal-yadav-says-will-form-new-party-1654535","Lucknow:                             Shivpal Yadav, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's estranged uncle, will contest the Uttar Pradesh elections as a candidate of the Samajwadi Party, but said he would reserve his campaigning for his supporters forced to contest as rebels and independents after being denied ticket by the party. Shivpal Yadav has also vowed to launch his own party after results for the UP assembly elections are announced on March 11.

The Chief Minister's uncle, isolated after Akhilesh Yadav took control of the party ahead of the crucial elections, was in Jaswant Nagar to file his nomination papers. While Akhilesh Yadav gave in to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav's request that Shivpal be fielded by the party, most of his supporters - many strong candidates, he said - have not been fielded.

""They were struck off the list of candidates to make me weak,"" Shivpal Yadav, 61, alleged in an attack on his nephew, who is now party president and is taking all the crucial decisions on the UP elections including sealing an alliance with the Congress.

Akhilesh Yadav's father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, has made it clear that he does not approve of the new partnership but his opinion is moot. Akhilesh Yadav has handed his father, who launched the Samajwadi Party 25 years ago, an advisory role as mentor.

For months before the elections, Shivpal Yadav needled and undermined the Chief Minister and was consistently backed by Mulayam SIngh, who is Shivpal Yadav's older brother.

""Netaji was attacked because he and I were speaking out against those who were doing wrong. I repeatedly requested Akhilesh not to insult Mulayam Singh but he didn't listen,"" a bitter Shivpal Yadav alleged today.

Shivpal Yadav said if the party had not fielded him, he would have contested as an independent candidate from the Jaswant Nagar constituency, which he represents."
"Union Budget 2017: Arun Jaitley's Budget Balm For Poor Skips Election Freebies","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-jaitley-budget-balm-for-poor-has-no-election-freebies-1655092","New Delhi: HighlightsBudget comes just just ahead of key elections in five states
It sought to ease pain of notes ban, gave tax breaks to the middle class
Also reached out to farmers, poor with special schemesFinance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Union Budget 2017 pledged to hike government spending on the rural poor and cut taxes on Wednesday, seeking to ease the pain of the notes ban in what he called it a ""budget for the poor"". He promised to double the income of farmers in the next five years and also to bring 10 million households out of poverty by 2019, seeking to reassure people that the slowdown of the economy caused by demonetisation would not spill over to the next year.

The Finance Minister promised more affordable housing for the poor, halved the basic rate of income tax to 5 per cent and cut taxes on small firms which make up 96 per cent of India's businesses, imposing an income-tax surcharge on those who earn more to offset the losses.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ban on 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, announced on November 8 with an aim to uproot corruption and black money, took out 86 per cent of the cash in circulation at the time. It resulted in a currency crunch that was seen to hit farmers, the rural poor and small traders the most.
 Arun Jaitley's Budget included special concessions for small businesses.Analysts said the Budget was in line with expectations that the government would target communities worst hit by the notes ban. But with elections beginning soon in five states, including in the crucial Uttar Pradesh, Mr Jaitley was expected to splurge on freebies which did not happen.  

The Budget was presented only three days before polling is held in Goa and Punjab, much to the chagrin of opposition parties who had alleged that the government advanced the Budget by a whole month only to be able to offer sops to voters. After it was presented, however, no major rival party called it an election budget, though they criticised it as presenting no vision.   

Congress leader and former union minister Anand Sharma said the budget ""misleading and directionless"" and alleged that the government had shifted it to avoid presenting the ""ill-effects of demonetisation.""

""I call this budget misleading because it is based on the data of just six months. The data from the third fiscal quarter, where the ill-effects of demonetisation will be visible, is not included in it...The budget, and all the rosy figures the Finance Minister is showing, is based on data prior to November 8, when demonetisation was announced. The estimates and projections are thus wrong,"" Mr Sharma said.

In his speech, Arun Jaitley defended demonetisation, saying it would increase revenues by forcing people to declare untaxed wealth, but conceded that it had hit the economy. On Tuesday the government lowered its growth forecast for the year ending in March 2017 to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.6 per cent in the previous year.

The ruling BJP says its recent gains in by-elections and civic polls are a signal that the people support PM Modi on the notes ban, despite the inconvenience that it has caused them. Opposition parties however allege that demonetisation has been a disaster, punishing the poor instead the corrupt, and have made it one of their main election agendas in the coming elections.  
 For the first time, the annual budget included expenditure on railways. (AFP)The battle for Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, is not only seen as a semi-final before national elections in 2019, but also offers parties the chance to win more Rajya Sabha seats, since most members of the upper house of Parliament are indirectly elected by state legislatures.

Rahul Gandhi:This alliance is against PM Modi's politics.The alliance is the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, out of which the Saraswati of development will come out.In PM Modi's words, this is 3Ps. This alliance is about progress, prosperity and peace.Akhilesh (Yadav) and I have a personal as well as a political relationship.I had said Akhilesh is a good boy, but he wasn't allowed to work (When asked about Congress' earlier slogan 27 Saal UP Behal)We want to stop the aggression that RSS-BJP is spreading and the false promises they are giving.We want to give the youth of UP a new path, a new politics.Won't reveal the campaign strategy.

But my respect for her is still intact.BJP makes one Indian fight against the other. Their ideology is dangerous for our country. But Mayawati's ideology is not of any danger to us. My point is - you can't compare BJP and BSP.This alliance isn't opportunistic. We will explain to Modiji, the BJP and the RSS that UP and its people are one. We will not let them create a divide.During negotiations there was posturing. He (Akhilesh) said something I said something, he pretended to be angry and so did I. it's a part of negotiations. Media should not take this too seriously.We have discussed the minimums of Congress that we believe in the politics of the poor. They should benefit from this.This is dil ka alliance hai, mil ke jeetenge (It is an alliance of heart, we will win together)The message to PM Modi through this alliance is that Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christians are one. We won't let Modi divide the nation.
Akhilesh Yadav:It is a people's alliance. There is no doubt, we will win all the seats. Development work will be faster now. Cycle and Hand is a great combination.Rahul (Gandhi) and I are like the two wheels of the same cycle.We were together in the Lok Sabha, we know each other. Now we are glad that we have to work together.There was a mention of 3P.

"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: In BJP's Manifesto, Ram Temple And 'Exodus' In Western UP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-bjp-will-win-with-two-thirds-majority-says-amit-shah-1653616","Lucknow: HighlightsAmit Shah releases BJP's manifesto for Uttar Pradesh polls
Says will form inclusive government, no discrimination over caste
Promises Ram temple in Ayodhya, laptops with 1 GB internet for students
                                Promising inclusive development if the BJP is elected, the party's chief Amit Shah on Saturday launched its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections will be held in multiple phases from February 11. Mr Shah also said the BJP was committed to exploring all constitutional options to ensure that the Ram temple is constructed in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya - emphasising that this marks no shift in the party's stand.

But a Hindutva push, subdued for the last few elections as the BJP has pitched development, was seen in it. Mr Shah said there was no contradiction, stating, ""Temple and development can co-exist.""

Among the promises that Mr Shah highlighted was closing down slaughter houses and he said the BJP, if elected, would seek the opinion of the state's Muslim women and then approach the Supreme Court on the issue of the Islamic divorce triple talaq. He also brought up the alleged mass migration of Hindu families from riot-hit towns in western UP that have a Muslim majority, saying the BJP would form teams to ensure to check the exodus of people from their homes because of communal tension and would put the onus on senior government officials to ensure it does not happen.

In its manifesto, the BJP has unveiled a 'zero-poverty plan', promised to waive loans for small farmers, free education and scholarships for the poor and, in what Mr Shah said tops the offer of Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, free laptops with 1 GB free internet for the young.

The BJP's laptops would be given to all regardless of caste or religion unlike the Samajwadi Party's, said Mr Shah, accusing Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's party and also Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party of neglecting UP's development for the last 15 years that they have in turns ruled the state. The BJP, if given a chance to return to power, would bring to UP the kind of development it has to other states it rules, Mr Shah pledged.

""If a state differentiates on the basis of their vote banks, there can't be justice for all citizens. We promise a government that will not discriminate on the basis of caste or creed,"" Mr Shah said in Lucknow, adding, ""Once the BJP comes to power, we work for development of all citizens unlike the SP and the BSP.""

In the 2014 election the BJP had swept 71 of UP's 80 seats. Amit Shah said he had feedback that the BJP would win the state by a two-thirds majority in these assembly elections. He hopes for more than 300 seats, Mr Shah said, adding, ""We have taken the feedback of about 30 lakh people through missed calls, letters, etc. We have done 5,000 public meetings.""

The BSP's Mayawati hit back at the BJP almost immediately saying the BJP has no ""moral right"" to issue another manifesto, when it had ""failed to fulfil any promises made in 2014"".

She also attacked Amit Shah on his remarks on the Ram temple at Ayodhya saying, ""The BJP's national president should know that is it a new thing they are saying that they will construct the Ram Mandir when they come to power here. The matter is in the Supreme Court. Till there is a decision, they can say what they want, the people will never let them do anything wrong here. This is Uttar Pradesh, not Gujarat."""

"PM Narendra Modi's Speech In Panjim Ahead Of Goa Elections 2017: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-pm-narendra-modi-addresses-public-rally-in-goas-panjim-1653603","Panjim, Goa:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi is addressing a public meeting today in Panjim ahead of the Goa assembly elections, scheduled for February 4. This comes a day after the Prime Minister campaigned in Punjab's Jalandhar alongwith the state's Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. Prime Minister Modi is expected to highlight the achievements of the BJP-led government in the state over five years and criticise the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party - which has fielded former Inspector General of Prisons Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate. ""The Congress is in a real bad shape. They are being opportunistic,"" the Prime Minister said yesterday in Jalandhar. Earlier during the day, the Prime Minister also addressed NCC officers and cadets at a rally in New Delhi.

Following are the highlights of PM Narendra Modi's speech:The last five years have been an era of development.On this foundation, we want to take the progress forward.In a survey of all small states, they found Goa was the shining star.Infrastructure, social schemes - the Goa government set an example for even the bigger states.I see from Delhi how much work has been done in Goa, I feel very happy about it.For years, Goa has suffered from a disease. This election is to rid Goa of that disease.What is that disease? It is the disease of instability.Political turmoil has hindered Goa's progress.There was a time in Goa's recent history when it saw a dozen chief ministers in 10 years.This slowed down Goa. This instability suited the Congress very well. They managed to shirk accountability.But then people of Goa decided to give five years to a single government. However, even then, for their own benefit they ran away.I appeal to people of Goa to give us a comfortable majority. If you do that I promise you, we will make Goa India's most comfortable state.Today, the Centre is stressing on tourism.People said tourism will dry up - notes ban will affect tourism.Today, they have been silenced.The old government did not understand that to bring tourists from abroad, you have to focus on the international audience. We did that.The government's efforts to encourage tourism benefits Goa the most.This is an industry which can give huge returns even with small investment. The poorest of the poor can earn from it.For 10 years, there was a government at the Centre which had no interest in building any bridges in Goa.This would adversely affect the state's economy. That's why we have focused on infrastructure in Goa.We are building a bridge which will be a convenience for the people and an attraction for the tourists.I can say proudly our government at the Centre has helped Goa more in 25 months than in the last 50 years.This is our speed; this is our direction.Some people don't progress and don't let others progress.  These people are the pickpockets of democracy. They show the country in a poor light.The government is going to release its budget on February 1.Some parties have already started calling economists and intellectuals. They are making drafts of messages to criticise us in Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab.They are working harder than the Finance Minister in their efforts to malign the budget.They are like those parents who blame teachers, schools for their children's poor performance in exams.Some parties have questioned why the Election Commission scheduled Goa and Punjab elections on the same date.This means they are prepping for losing. If you don't have faith in the umpire, why have you come to play?People are trying to drag politics to such levels and they feel proud of it.Tell me, aren't Indians smart? Why is the Congress being defeated across the country?Well, Goans are smarter than the rest of India.They have seen Congress's misrule and corruption. So they will not vote for the Congress.There can be political differences, ideological differences - this is normal in a democracy.But it pains me when political leaders run away from debates about development.Governments should be measured by the development they bring.Today the world, after many years, is watching a government which can take strong, decisive decisions.Tell me, isn't the whole world hailing India or not? In America? In Japan? In China? In Sri Lanka? In Nepal?What is the reason for this? Not because of Modi. This is happening because 125 crore Indians picked a government with complete majority after 30 years.Shouldn't Goa too have a stable government with a comfortable majority? Shouldn't Goa be hailed across India?That's why I appeal to you to give us a comfortable majority.There is a time constraint. I have to leave before the sun sets, I cannot break rules of the armed forces. The Defence Minister is sitting here.Goa has given such a strong Defence Minister. The world is still talking about surgical strikes.Once Indian soldiers decide something, they prove their valour.February 4 is voting day. Please vote in large numbers. Let Goa bloom like the lotus."

Here are the live updates of Mayawati's press conference:The BJP has no right to announce a political manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.PM Modi in 2014 had promised a lot in the Lok Sabha elections in UP. He had said that he wanted to provide electricity to all the people of Uttar Pradesh, he said we will do a lot in 20 days and 30 days.In 2014, he had promised that he will bring all the black money from the foreign countries to India.He has not finished even one fourth of his work.

The data analysis, released by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) on Tuesday, showed that 97 per cent of candidates of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are multi-millionaires, followed by the Congress at 92 per cent and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) with 52 per cent.

The percentage of candidates with pending criminal cases is quite low. Only 38 out of the 251 candidates (15 per cent) have declared criminal cases against them. A total of 19 candidates (8 per cent) have serious criminal charges against them.

Party-wise, most candidates with criminal cases are from the Congress (9 of 37, or 24 per cent), followed by the BJP (17 per cent) and the AAP (8 per cent).

                                Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has been asked by the Election Commission to explain by Friday his controversial remarks during campaigning for the upcoming elections in Goa in which he appeared to tell people that they could accept money from any political party but should vote for the BJP.

On Sunday, the minister had told a small crowd at Chimbel near Panaji: ""...I understand if someone organises a rally and you take Rs. 500 for moving around with (the candidate), that is not a problem. But when you vote, choose the lotus (BJP's poll symbol). This you must remember.""

The Election Commission had ordered the police to file a First Information Report or FIR against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party, after he stoked row with a similar statement.

At a rally in Goa's Benaulim earlier this month, Mr Kejriwal had said: ""If Congress or BJP candidates offer money, do not refuse it. Accept it as your own money. But when it comes to voting, press the button against the name of the AAP candidate.""

But in an apparent correction on Monday, Mr Parrikar said, ""I want to say this to you: please do not fall for any greed. Voting is a pure deed... The government is for the next generation. So, while electing a government, you have to decide what the coming government will give us.""

Regional party Goa Forward however registered a complaint with the Election Commission, saying that if action is being taken against Mr Kejriwal for similar comments, the Defence Minister should not be spared.

In several tweets, the Delhi Chief Minister also dared the Election Commission to take action against Mr Parrikar. On Tuesday, he also posted a video of the minister's comments.

""Will EC dare take action against Manohar Parrikar?"" Mr Kejriwal said in tweets, adding, ""I urge PMO to allow EC to act against Parrikar.""

The Congress also demanded action against Mr Parrikar.

Goa will vote on February 4 for a new 40-seat assembly."
"Punjab Elections 2017: Candidates Visit Sirsa Dera To Seek 'Blessings'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-elections-2017-candidates-visit-sirsa-dera-to-seek-blessings-1653496","Chandigarh:                             Several assembly election candidates from ruling SAD-BJP and the Congress in Punjab today visited the Sirsa-headquarted Dera Sacha Sauda to ""seek blessings"" of the sect chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh ahead of the February 4 polls in the state.

Over 20 candidates, including Akali Dal leader and finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa, former Punjab chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and Congress youth leader Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, reached Sirsa to meet the sect chief.

Notably, the Election Commission strictly prohibits the use of temples, mosques, churches, gurudwaras or any place of worship for election propaganda, including speeches, posters, music etc, on electioneering.

 However, many of those who met the Dera chief, tried to downplay their meeting, saying there was nothing political about their visit.

After meeting Mr Singh, Mr Dhindsa told reporters that it was not the question of Dera support or otherwise. He asserted that there was ""nothing political"" about his visit.

Some others said they do visit the Dera once in a while and the timing should not be linked with the Punjab elections.

Mr Bhattal said the Dera, like Congress, supports causes like drug de-addiction and sends out a message to wean away the youths from the drug menace.

The Dera has a number of followers in many areas of Punjab, especially in the Malwa region which accounts for bulk of the assembly seats in the 117-member Punjab Assembly.

Ram Singh, chairperson of the Dera's political wing, told reporters that no decision had been taken so far, when asked if the political wing had decided to extend support to any particular political outfit."

The BJP had expelled Dayashankar Singh, who was once deputy chief of the party's UP unit, for allegedly using derogatory words against BSP chief Mayawati.

Swati Singh, a teacher by profession, was appointed the state president of the BJP's women wing in October last year. She had come to prominence after she launched a campaign against BSP leaders who had raised slogans against her minor daughter following her husband's use of derogatory words for Ms Mayawati.

BJP state media incharge Harish Chandra Srivastava informed that Ms Singh;s candidacy was announced after being approved by party national president Amit Shah.

In July 2016, the BJP expelled then Dayashankar Singh from the party over his use of derogatory words directed toward former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Ms Mayawati, which created a national controversy. The opposition parties stood united and unanimously condemned Mr Singh.  A police case was also filed by BSP leaders.

Senior BJP lawmaker and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley issued a statement in the Parliament, ""It is not right and I condemn the use of this word. If a person has said this, we will investigate.

""I express personal regret. I associate with your dignity and stand with you,"" he said, addressing Ms Mayawati.

Mr Singh, eventually, issued an apology and said, ""She (Mayawati) has come up after a lot of struggle.""

"Goa Elections 2017: Dare Parties To Fight Polls Over Progress, Says PM Narendra Modi","http://www.ndtv.com/goa-news/goa-elections-2017-pm-narendra-modi-dares-opposition-to-fight-goa-polls-on-development-plank-1653666","Panaji:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today dared opposition parties to fight the upcoming Assembly polls on the over development ushered instead of raking up minor issues like advancement of the Union budget and election dates.

""The opposition parties are working overtime, more than the efforts put in by Finance Minister to prepare the Budget, to criticise the advancement of budget date. It is an indication that these parties have accepted defeat in the forthcoming polls,"" he said, addressing an election rally in Goa's capital Panaji.

""Though the union budget is going to be presented on February 1, some political parties are already making graphs to criticise the government, without even having an idea of the budgetary provisions,"" PM Modi said.

The PM appealed to the voters of Goa to give a comfortable majority to the BJP in the election for ""growth"" and stability of the state, which had suffered due to instability in the past.

Goa is going to polls on February 4.

PM Modi also made a reference to the objection raised for holding elections in Punjab and Goa on the same day.

""A political party (referring to AAP) even went ahead and alleged that PMO pressurised the Election Commission for holding elections on the same day for these two states. The system has to be respected and strengthened. But some people take pride in devaluing it,"" said the Prime Minister.

While appealing to the voters to give comfortable majority to BJP, PM Modi said, ""My government in New Delhi has given more to Goa in last 25 months than what the state received from the Centre in last 50 years. There have been some facilities provided such as visa on arrival and Goa is major beneficiary of such facilities.""

""With minimum investment, tourism sector can prosper. Tourism also helps a cross-section of the society by creation of jobs. My government will work with the state government -- shoulder to shoulder for the betterment of Goa,"" he said. PM Modi said BJP will create the best infrastructure in Goa for the tourists as well as locals

Blaming the previous UPA government at the centre, he said ""In the 10-year rule (of UPA government) there were no funds for Goa for construction of even a bridge.""

""More than development of the state, some political parties get pleasure in hurting others,"" he said.

""People of the country are wise; hence Congress is being defeated everywhere. People of Goa are wiser; hence they should vote for BJP and give a comfortable mandate,"" he said.

This comes amidst the strong speculation that Mr Parrikar could make a return to state politics if the BJP retains its control in Goa.

""The chief minister, whoever he is, has to be young at heart,"" Mr Parrikar said, replying to a voter's question at a BJP youth convention in Panaji.

""Though there is a requirement of youth to be the chief minister, I feel that the chief minister can be a slightly elder person who can understand the aspirations of the youth,"" he added.

The Union Minister also said that political stability is a compulsion for the development of a state like Goa.

""I remember, in 1989, I never thought I was destined to be in politics. In those 10 years, I saw at least 12 chief ministers.. If you want to have a comprehensive development of Goa, the plan needs to be worked out. But during that time, there was no plan,"" Mr Parrikar said.

 At a rally yesterday, BJP president Amit Shah had announced that should the party retain power in Goa, the next government would function under Mr Parrikar's leadership - which fuelled strong rumours of the Defence Minister's return to the coastal state.

Even Union Minister Nitin Gadkari hinted that the chief minister could either be someone from the legislators, or could be sent to the state from the Centre.

Manohar Parrikar, then Chief Minister of Goa, was inducted into the Union government as Defence Minister in 2014. He was succeeded by Laxmikant Parsekar as Goa Chief Minister.

Legislators Nemcha Kipgen and Vungzagin Valte submitted their resignation letters to party President TN Haokip as well as to Speaker Th Lokeshwor, they said. With the resignation, the strength of Congress has gone down to 45 seats in the 60-member House.

Kipgen had been elected in the last assembly polls from Kangpokpi constituency which had recently been upgraded into Kangpokpi district.

Valte was elected from Thanlon assembly constituency. Vice-president of Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) S Achouba also resigned from the primary membership of the party.

Incidentally, the state's move to carve out seven new districts has triggered protests by Manipur's apex Naga organisation United Naga Council (UNC).

Last year, three veteran Congress heavyweights N Biren, Y Erabot and Francis Ngajokpa had resigned and joined the BJP.

Elections for the 60-member Manipur Assembly will be held in two phases, on March 4 and March 8.

BJP, which is in direct fight with the Congress in the state, is unlikely to project any chief ministerial candidate.

Many Congress leaders have resigned from the party and joined the BJP ahead of the polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Punjab including stalwarts like Vijay Bahuguna and Rita Bahuguna Joshi among others."

JD(U) national General Secretary KC Tyagi told reporters in Patna that the decision to pull out of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections was taken at the party's core committee meeting yesterday.

""The decision has been taken to defeat the communal forces and also to ensure no further division in secular votes takes place,"" Mr Tyagi said. He also expressed disappointment that a comprehensive alliance on the lines of grand-alliance in Bihar, where all ""secular forces"" joined hands to defeat the BJP, could not be formed. Samajwadi Party and Congress have, however, formed a pre-poll alliance in UP.

""We are disappointed, surprised and hurt that both SP and Congress failed to form a grand alliance on the lines of Bihar that proved to be a milestone in nation's politics. Bihar's grand alliance was formed by the efforts of both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad who buried their differences for a bigger objective,"" Mr Tyagi said.

""If we have to win the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then it is necessary that BJP must be defeated in UP polls,"" he said.

Mr Tyagi also said, that had Ajit Singh's party Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and JD(U) been accommodated in the grand alliance, it would have won 300 seats in the UP assembly.

He was accompanied by Water Resources Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh, party National General Secretaries RCP Singh, Shyam Rajak, Sanjay Jha and others.

Asked if Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is also JD(U)'s national president, would go to Uttar Pradesh if invited by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for campaigning, Ranjan Singh said ""he (Nitish Kumar) would not go to UP for campaigning"".

""We don't have much stake in UP, so we will pray from here (sitting in Patna) for them to win,"" Mr Singh said.

Mr Tyagi further expressed his disappointment that hard work put in by party workers in preparing grounds for UP assembly polls in five divisions where Nitish Kumar addressed some public meetings could not fructify."

Incumbent legislators Nemcha Kipgen and Vungzagin Valte tendered their resignation letters to state party chief TN Haokip as well as assembly Speaker Th Lokeshwor. With their resignations, the strength of the Congress in the assembly has reduced to 45.

The vice president of the Congress' Manipur unit S Achouba also resigned from primary membership of the party.

Last year, three senior legislators - N Biren Singh, Y Erabot Singh and Francis Ngajokpa - had quit the Congress and joined the BJP. Sources said that Mr Kipgen, Mr Valte and Mr Achouba might also join the BJP.

The BJP has claimed that several senior ministers would also quit the Congress ahead of the polls.

Mr Kipgen had been elected from the Kangpokpi assembly seat in the last elections whereas Mr Valte was elected from the Thanlon constituency.The Congress has been ruling in the state of Manipur for the last 15 years.

Manipur is facing a crisis after the United Naga Council called for an economic blockade on November 1 to protest against the state government's decision to bifurcate Naga dominated areas and create seven new districts. The economic blockade has affected the key road links to the state, including National Highway-2 and National Highway-37, which in turn has created an acute shortage of essential goods and supplies."

Mr Mann to contest from Jalalabad seat against Akali Dal's Sukhbir Badal
                                Bhagwant Mann for Punjab Chief Minister? The Aam Aadmi Party lawmaker who made headlines and earned the wrath of his colleagues last year by live-streaming his arrival at parliament, is drawing massive crowds while campaigning across the state and his party's leaders are reportedly weighing projecting him for the state's top job.

AAP's Manish Sisodia recently said only someone from Punjab will be Chief Minister if the party wins the assembly elections, a disclaimer prompted by speculation that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal could shift to that state. Delhi lawmaker and Lambi candidate Jarnail Singh told NDTV that AAP's Chief Minister will be a ""turban-wearing Sikh.""

Bhagwant Mann, 44, a former comic and very popular in Punjab, fits the bill. In a measure of his party's faith in him, he is also taking on Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal of the Akali Dal for the Jalalabad assembly seat, in what is pegged as the biggest battle in Punjab.  

On the campaign trail Mr Mann is now definitely keen to project that he is ready for a larger role. He refuses to crack jokes on cue or perform the limericks which made him a hit with the media.

When asked by this reporter whether he could be projected by the party as presumptive Chief Minister, Mr Mann did not reject the possibility. ""I never said I will be Chief Minister but the public is there. They are saying..what they want. Our leadership has said they will decide later. Let us wait.""

""Nothing has been decided yet,"" a senior AAP leader said in Delhi, but admitted, ""there is amazing craze for Mann among voters.""

What may be holding the AAP leadership back from announcing Bhagwant Mann as its Chief Ministerial candidate is the negative impact of his parliament live stream. He was suspended for a day and faced ferocious attacks from rival parties like the Akali Dal and Congress for exposing parliament to a security threat. His party, however, stood by him through the entire episode.

Bhagwant Mann's Sangrur parliamentary seat was one of four that Arvind Kejriwal's party won in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The party had won all its Lok Sabha seats from Punjab and now hopes to replicate there, its sweep of Delhi in 2015."

A team of excise officials conducted raids at two wine shops in Samrala assembly constituency in the Ludhiana district and seized bundles of such slips from them.

VK Singh, Chief Electoral Officer of Punjab, told NDTV, ""It is the first of its kind seizure by our raiding team. We were getting inputs about the new tactics to distribute liquor among voters through slips.""

After receiving a tip off, a team of excise officials, led by Additional excise and taxation commissioner Kumar Saurabh Raj, conducted raid at two wine shops in Bhattian and Mand Jharaudi villages of Samrala on Wednesday morning. To its surprise the team found eight bundles, each containing 90-100 liquor distribution slips, and a stamp from the stores. This is first such seizure after the model code of conduct came into effect in Punjab, which votes for a new government next month.

""With poll date round the corner, certain elements were planning to use these slips to distribute liquor to influence voters, we are interrogating the staff of wine shops to find out if they were meant for any particular candidate,"" said Mr Singh.  

Slips mentioned 'two bottle Royal Arm', 'two bottle McD Rum', 'One bottle Hamira' and 'one C/S McD Rum'.

""The reports doing rounds of my joining BJP are nothing but rumours and only show the fear of BJP which is spreading them... this is an attempt to malign my image and I will go to court against it,"" Mr Agarwal, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP, told the media in Lucknow.

""BJP knows that when they will come out to campaign they will not get the votes of traders and so are resorting to such rumours,"" he alleged.

He was reacting to media reports that he might soon join the BJP soon.

Mr Agarwal said he was with Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav.

To a question on chances of party lawmaker Beni Prasad Verma's son joining the BJP after he was denied a Samajwadi Party ticket from the constituency of his choice, Mr Agarwal said ""Beni should resign from his membership of the Upper House that would be more courageous of him... harming the party from inside will only harm him"".

The party's chief ministerial candidate Elvis Gomes addressing a public gathering in Cuncolim constituency said, ""Corruption is one of the main issues as far as Goa is concerned. In Goa, superficially it may look everything is hinky dory but deep inside, these processes are not functioning and the local population is affected.""

Mr Gomes, a former Inspector General of Prisons, will contest the election from Cuncolim constituency. He said that the AAP will focus on improving governance as well as removing casinos from the state.

""Improve the governance structure, streamline them, give them necessary training, making them efficient, put good people on the job and see that all your policies start percolating at grassroot level; that is the first priority,"" Mr Gomes said.

Punjab votes for a new government next week and PM Modi asked the state to return the Akali Dal-BJP for an unprecedented third straight term.

""You all can see how the Congress is collapsing across the country...They are desperate for power, their desperation is like that of a fish out of water,"" PM Modi said at a rally in Punjab's Jalandhar, a few hours after the Congress' Rahul Gandhi launched a big attack on the Badals at Majitha, about 80 km away.
 PM Narendra Modi asked people to bring the Badal family back to power in the Punjab elections 2017.So badly off is the Congress, PM Modi said, that it ""can go to any extent for the power of the chair,"" pointing to the rival party's election tie-ups in states like Bengal, Bihar and now Uttar Pradesh, where it is ready to play junior partner to regional heavyweights.

PM Modi credited Chief Minister Badal with working ""night and day for the unity of Hindus and Sikhs"" and said that in their many meetings all that the 89-year-old chief minister has discussed with him is the welfare of Punjab's farmers and its poor.

""Badal Sahab has always been true to Punjab, he has always given his best and Punjab would love to see him lead it towards development and a better future,"" the Prime Minister said, accusing rival parties of ""going to any extent in their selfishness and greed for power to ruin Punjab's image"" and asking the state to ""punish them all for speaking about this great land in bad light"".
 Rahul Gandhi attacked the Badal family in his speech today ahead of Punjab elections 2017.In his speech at Majitha, Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Badal family has ""taken away everything from Punjab"" accusing them of forcing the people of the state to pay a ""Badal tax."" Mr Gandhi is on a three-day tour of Punjab that will see him travel to all the seats that the immediate and extended family of the chief minister is contesting. He began his visit in Majitha, the constituency of powerful Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia, the brother in law of Sukhbir Badal, who is deputy chief minister and the Chief Minister's son. He will also campaign in Mr Badal senior's Lambi constituency and his son's Jalalabad constituency.

The PM mocked the Congress' efforts saying the party was so sure it was winning the 2012 election that it had begun practicing taking oath. But for the first time ever Punjab had re-elected a government, voting the Akali-Dal BJP back in power. It would happen again this time, PM Modi said."

Sanjay Sinh's second wife Ameeta Sinh, 54, wanted to contest the Amethi assembly seat as the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance's official candidate. But in his half-half division of the 10 seats in Amethi and adjacent Raebareli, Gandhi turf, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav chose to retain Amethi for his Samajwadi Party to contest. Sitting legislator and minister Gayatri Prajapati is the alliance's candidate.

""Amethi is my family and my home and I cannot leave it... I will contest from here,"" said Ameeta Sinh, a three-time MLA and former state minister who claims she has worked hard in the constituency and is a strong candidate. Ms Sinh said she was talking to senior Congress leaders.  

She accused the BJP of ""petty politics"" for picking Garima Sinh, a political novice, to contest in Amethi. ""They have given ticket to someone who has no recognition in the region... people here have neither seen her nor has she seen them for years,"" Ameeta Sinh alleged.

The BJP is betting on Garima Sinh coming out on top as palace intrigue plays out politically - in Amethi, both are called Rani or Queen.

Garima Sinh, who calls Sanjay Sinh's marriage to Ameeta illegal, had in 2014 moved into a portion of the Bhupati Bhawan Palace in Amethi that Sanjay and Ameeta live in, along with her son and three daughters, laying claim to the considerable family fortune. She is the niece of former Prime Minister VP Singh and is said to have a fair amount of support among locals despite having been away from Amethi for many years.

Ameeta Sinh was earlier married to national badminton champ Syed Modi who was shot dead in 1988. Sanjay Sinh and Ameeta were charged with murder but were later acquitted by courts.

The battle of the Ranis may draw attention, but Samajwadi Party's Gayatri Prajapati, a backward caste leader, is still seen to have the edge in Amethi. He had defeated Ameeta Singh in 2012 by almost 10,000 votes. The BJP's candidate had polled less than 10,000 votes.

Amethi will vote on February 27, in phase five of the seven-phase UP election.  Results will be announced on March 11."
"Punjab Elections 2017: Meet Nirvaan Singh, The Man Behind Captain Amarinder Singh's New Twitter Skills","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-elections-2017-meet-nirvaan-singh-the-man-behind-captain-amarinder-singhs-new-twitter-skills-1653156","Macchiwara, Punjab:                             Nirvaan Singh, an unassuming young man of 27, goes everywhere that Captain Amarinder Singh does on his campaign trail, between rallies engaging the 75-year-old Congressman on his smartphone as he explains social media tools, prepares him for a Facebook Live or just asks him to respond to a query.

Nirvaan Singh is Captain's grandson and runs his social media campaign. He has his task cut out as his grandfather, an old-style politician, takes on the likes of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, famous for its use of social media for election campaigns.

He says Captain's eagerness to learn new skills for canvassing is an advantage and he provides the bridge between the Congress' state chief and the election strategist Prashan Kishore and his team of number-crunching professionals deployed by the party for next week's assembly elections.

""Before putting anything out on social media, we discuss it with Prashant Kishore and his team and the rest he does,"" Nirvan said, referring to his grandfather. Unlike the last election where the social media teams needed laptops, now it's all on smartphones and Nirvaan only needs his iPhone 7.

""I think it's great,"" said Amarinder Singh to NDTV. ""I look at what people are saying till about 1 am, so it is great fun."" Captain, who is leading his party's attempt to wrest Punjab back from the Akali Dal-BJP after 10 years, says he prefers Facebook to Twitter which Nirvaan scopes out for him.

So are the recent Twitter battles that Amrinder Singh has waged with Delhi Chief Minister and AAP boss Arvind Kejriwal all Nirvaan's doing? No, says the grandson, fully crediting his grandfather. ""That was all him. I was reading what his opponents said about him and he said 'sneaky little fellow' and the other stuff, and I said well, you have to put it out there, all that you think,"" Nirvaan said smiling.

The rest, was headlines.

In the latest edition earlier this month, Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted after touring Patiala the constituency that Captain Amrinder Singh is contesting, ""Huge public support. Captain will lose his own election this time."" Captain had shot back, ""If you are so sure, why don't you come and fight me? You sneaky little fellow!""

Nirvan's millennial status is probably his best qualification for this job, more than his History Honours degree from St Stephen's. But its a job that lasts only till March 11, when votes will be counted in five states, including Punjab, where elections will be held in a single phase on February 4.

""After that, I'm getting married,"" said Nirvaan, who has worked in a media company before going full time with his granded a year ago"
"Goa Elections 2017: Congress Promises Free 5 Litres Of Petrol Per Month To Students","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-elections-2017-congress-promises-free-5-litres-of-petrol-per-month-to-students-1651822","Panaji:                             The Congress released its manifesto for the upcoming assembly elections in Goa, scheduled for February 4, in the presence of party MP Jyotiraditya Scindia in Panaji. According to the manifesto, the party has vowed to permanently close all casinos - including floating vessels mounted with gambling dens - in the state as well as free petrol upto five litres per month to every college student.

On the issue of casinos, Goa Congress chief Luizinho Faleiro proposed that the implementation of the ban would take place in phases. Offshore casinos, which are currently in river Mandovi, will be shut down in the first phase whereas onshore casinos would be banned in the second.

""Those on the shore too will be closed at a later stage,"" Mr Falerio added.

When asked if such a move would hamper employment in the state, he said, ""I don't think that there are many Goans working at these casinos.""

The Congress party also promises five litres of free petrol per month to every college student with a valid driving license in the state.

The Congress manifesto also states that the party ""strongly opposes holding defence expo in Goa or give permanent rights to the Defence Ministry to hold the land on lease or on ownership basis anywhere in the state."" It further assures the citizens of a thorough probe into permissions granted the state's Investment Promotion Board for establishing industries in Goa.

At the event, Mr Scindia also accused Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal of ""selling dreams"" to the people of Goa.

""It is the party that believes in building a castle of dreams... Macimum number of their MLAs are being questioned for their own corruption-related matters. I don't any paradigm that would be different about Goa,"" the Lok Sabha MP from Guna told reporters.

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had earlier stated that the party would contest 36 of the 40 constituencies in Goa. The remaining four will be accommodated to others under a seat-sharing agreement.

"UP Elections 2017: BJP's Keshav Prasad Maurya, After Promising Ram Temple, Does U-Turn","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjps-keshav-prasad-maurya-after-promising-ram-temple-does-u-turn-1652769","New Delhi:                             Keshav Prasad Maurya, the BJP's Uttar Pradesh president, had on Tuesday sent shockwaves when he promised a Ram Temple in Ayodhya should the BJP come to power. He did a complete u-turn today, saying his statements have been ""misconstrued"".

The temple issue, the 47-year-old leader told NDTV, is ""a personal matter of faith"" for him, but not an issue in this time's assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, which will vote in seven phases beginning next week.

The Election Commission has, citing a recent Supreme Court order, warned political parties to desist from seeking votes in the name of religion.

The ""main issue in the election is of lawlessness, murders, rapes, loots and caste based politics"" Mr Maurya said today, adding that if the BJP comes to power, ""goons will rot in jail.""

Keshav Prasad Maurya, who took over as the BJP's UP president in April last year, has an RSS or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh background. He was also a member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad or VHP, which led has led the demand for a Ram temple in Ayodhya. The RSS is the ideological mentor of both the BJP and the VHP.

The BJP has for many years now not included the Ayodhya temple as an election issue.

Mr Maurya is an Other Backward Caste or OBC leader and his appointment as state chief last year was seen as part of the party's strategy to woo that the BC vote bank in the state.

The BJP, which had won only 47 seats in the 2012 assembly elections, hopes to extend its performance in the 2104 national election in UP to this year's assembly election. The party had swept the state then winning 71 of UP's 80 seats.

Elections are being held in UP along with four others states - Punjab, Goa, Uttarkhand and Manipur - and votes will be counted in all them on March 11."
"Uttarakhand Elections 2017: BJP Leader Attacks Ex-Boss, Chief Minister Harish Rawat, Over Firing At Rally","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-elections-2017-bjp-leader-attacks-ex-boss-chief-minister-harish-rawat-over-firing-at-ral-1653096","Yashpal Arya, 10 days old in the BJP, had a close shave on Wednesday when clashes broke out while he was addressing a public meeting in Uttarakhand's Bajpur, the assembly seat he is contesting in next month's election in the state. Someone fired shots and there was also a stampede and Mr Arya, unhurt in the incident, has accused Chief Minister Harish Rawat of the Congress of sanctioning an attack on him.

Mr Arya is a prominent Dalit leader of the Uttarakhand and was a minister in the Rawat government before he became Congress leader number 12 to rebel against the Chief Minister. He is what is being called a ""turncoat"" in this year's election - politicians who have just defected to the BJP but have already been fielded by it in the elections, causing immense heartburn in their new party.

The BJP has 10 such candidates in Uttarakhand, where it is contesting all 70 assembly seats.         

On January 16, Mr Arya along with his son, Sanjiv, was inducted into the BJP in the presence of party chief Amit Shah. Within hours the BJP confirmed that it would field both father and son in this year's election.

The BJP has alleged that Yashpal Arya was attacked in vendetta politics. ""There is a conspiracy underway to kill me. I was not only fired at. Even my vehicle was pelted with stones,"" Mr Arya alleged.

""It reflects the frustration of the Congress and the Chief Minister,"" said BJP's Uttarakhand president Ajay Bhatt.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat, known to take swiftly to social media to respond to his detractors hasn't issued a statement yet, nor has his party said anything.

The BJP acquired Mr Arya as it attempts to woo the Dalit community in Uttarakhand which it hopes to wrest from the Congress. In the last election, the Congress had won 32 seats, while the BJP had won 31 in a photo-finish. The Congress formed government and Harish Rawat also managed to survive a trust vote last year.

But 10 Congress legislators who commanded power and authority in the state unit are now in the BJP."
"Church Opposing BJP Is A False Perception During Polls: Laxmikant Parsekar","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/church-opposing-bjp-is-a-false-perception-during-polls-laxmikant-parsekar-1651851","Panaji:                             Minority community in Goa has shed its inhibitions towards the BJP and is no more averse to support the saffron party in elections, Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar said today.

He also said a ""false perception"" is being deliberately created during every election that Church has opposed BJP.

""During every election, an impression is created that Church is against us. Church is a religious institution and I would not like to comment on it. But one thing is sure that a few years back, minority brethren were suspicious about BJP and were staying away,"" Mr Parsekar told reporters in Goa.

Interestingly, the Goa Church yesterday expressed its concern over the government's push for cashless transactions, saying the Centre has ""shifted"" from its social policy of uplift of the poor by insisting on the digital transition.

The CM, contesting the February 4 elections from his pocket borough Mandrem, said the minorities have started having a ""positive outlook"" towards BJP.

""In the past, I had a personal experience in my own constituency. Initially, I failed to even open an account in the booths in minority-dominated wards. But it has changed. The situation was different in 2007...I got majority on those booths,"" he said, adding the minorities have started trusting the saffron party.

For total 40 seats going to polls on February 4, the BJP has fielded its candidates on 36 seats and is supporting Independent nominees in two constituencies.

Mr Parsekar said incumbent deputy Chief Minister Francis D'Souza was the first candidate from minority community to accept our candidature and became part of the government.

""After that several leaders from minority accepted our candidature. They were even with us in the government for five years,"" he said.

On the BJP refraining from projecting him as the Chief Ministerial face for the polls, Parsekar said he was never projected as the probable candidate even during the past.

Mr Parsekar replaced Manohar Parrikar as CM after the latter was made Defence Minister.

""I became CM and ran the government for more than two years. I don't want to answer someone's criticism. The election for the post of CM would be held democratically. Let us get the majority after that the elected representatives will decide on the CM candidate,"" he said.

Union minister and BJP's election in-charge in Goa, Nitin Gadkari recently caused a flutter when he said the next chief minister of Goa would be either from elected representatives or would be sent from the Centre, triggering speculations that he was pointing at Mr Parrikar, a Goan."

The request of the Election Commission comes ahead of the assembly elections in five states, which begin on February 8. According to the last rule of the Central Bank, one can withdraw Rs. 24,000 a week from banks. But no special provision has been made for the candidates contesting the assembly elections.

In its letter to the Reserve Bank, the Commission said it has been ""apprised of the problems"" the candidates are facing. The government, it said, has fixed a limit of expenditure, which is 28 lakh for Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and Rs. 20 lakh for Manipur and Goa. But given the cap of Rs. 24,000 on withdrawal per week, the candidates can withdraw only Rs. 96,000 over the three to four weeks left, the Commission pointed pointed out.

""Even considering that part of the expenditure will be incurred through cheque, petty and recurring expenditure is generally incurred in cash,"" the letter read. ""The issue is further compounded in rural areas, where banking facilities are not available or are negligible.""

The ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which came within a few hours of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise announcement on November 8, has been followed by a huge cash crunch as nearly 86 per cent of currency suddenly went out of circulation. The Reserve Bank imposed withdrawal limits from banks and ATMs. While the situation has eased as the new notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 2000 trickled into circulation, the RBI is relaxing the cash withdrawal rules in phrases.

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the central bank will remove restrictions on cash withdrawals only after assessing market situation and the government will not interfere in the process.

The elections, which will begin on February 8, will end in March. The results will be announced on March 11."

The BJP list had names of defectors from other parties, including former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Swami Prasad Maurya, who is contesting from Padrauna assembly seat in Kushinagar district.

BJP's senior leader in Uttar Pradesh Surya Pratap Shahi has been fielded from Pathardeva constituency in Deoria district.

With the third list of 67 candidates, the saffron party has so far announced a total of 371 candidates out of 403. Now, 32 seats are left, some of which will go to BJP's alliance partners Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).

BJP National Secretary Arun Singh, who announced the list, said the party has tried to give representation to every section of people in its list.

On being asked why there is not even a single Muslim candidate in BJP's list, Mr Singh said the party would field one as soon as it finds a ""suitable candidate"".

""We will give ticket to Muslims whenever we find a suitable candidate,"" he said.

To a question of many ""star-kids"" in the BJP list though the party openly criticises nepotism, Arun Singh said there is nothing wrong if a family member of a leader gets ticket on the basis of their work.

""If a person has been working for the party for several years, he can ask for a ticket even if he/she is a family member of an existing leader,"" Mr Singh said.

He said the BJP's ""approach is different"" from parties like Samajwadi Party and Congress which are ""run by one family only""."
"Election Commission Bars Schemes For Poll-Bound States In Union Budget","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/election-commission-bars-schemes-for-poll-bound-states-in-union-budget-1651904","New Delhi: HighlightsOpposition parties had challenged Budget announcement ahead of polls
Supreme Court ruled that Budget need not be delayed
Poll body says budget cannot have schemes specific for poll-bound states
                                No specific schemes can be announced in the union budget for the five states where assembly elections are due this year, the Election Commission has said. The Commission said, ""in the interest of free and fair elections"" and to maintain ""level playing field during elections"", no state specific schemes should be announced in the national budget, which may influence the voters in the five poll-bound states ""in favour of the ruling party"".

The Commission also said it should be ensured that in the Budget speech, ""the government's achievements in respect of the five states will also not be highlighted in any manner"".

The top election body's comments came after opposition parties complained to poll panel and wanted the budget to be postponed.

""We hope and we clearly say that it is the responsibility of the Election Commission and they must abide by their constitutional duty to ensure that polls are free and fair, that no kind of inducements which will impress upon the voter in the election in the five states would happen,"" news agency Press Trust of India had quoted Congress spokesperson Ajoy Kumar as saying.

Earlier on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the budget will be held on February 1. The order came in response to a petition that sought the budget be pushed back in view of the assembly elections in five states, so it would not influence the voters.

The court, however, said the union budget has ""nothing to do with states"". ""Throughout the year, there may be elections in different states, so should the centre not present the budget?"" the judges questioned.

Last year, the centre had announced that it would present the budget earlier than usual so it does not clash with the election schedule. Ending a practice that had started in the British era, the government also said the railway budget would be merged with the annual budget.

The elections in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur will begin on February 4. The results for all states will be announced on March 11."

He kickstarted his three-day visit of the state from Amritsar's Majitha where he attacked the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance as well as the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party. He will also address the public later today in Bathinda. While the Congress seeks to regain power in the state after a decade, the AAP - which won four seats in the 2014 Union elections - is contesting its first Assembly polls in the state. The Congress also managed to convince former BJP lawmaker Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife to join the party as its star campaigners in Punjab. After his three-day visit to Punjab, the Congress vice president will travel to the poll-bound state of Goa.

Here are the main highlights from Rahul Gandhi's speech:Punjab, the land of 5 rivers, used to support the entire nation.The state which not only used to fill the country's stomachs, but also fund the country's economy to a great extent.It was raining here yesterday. But Punjab's Badals don't rain down on its people.Despite Badals, the people of this state don't get water. They are deprived.Today, Punjab has a massive drug problem.Business and industry is shrinking - be it textile or manufacturing, industries are leaving the state.When you look around, only one family has a monopoly.Other states are progressing rapidly, but Punjab stands where it has been for decades. No improvement at all.If the Congress is voted to power, we will ensure strict action is taken against those involved in the drug racket. The Congress will show you all how we will defeat drugs.We will ensure farmers are benefitted. We will ensure the poor get their due.Punjab will get back the money it has lost over these years.The people of Punjab are being looted everyday. It is happening in one way or another. The Congress will ensure that this money returns to the people.Ask you brothers and sisters in Delhi, ask the Punjabis in Delhi if AAP has delivered anything.All they do is make false promises. Nothing is being done in Delhi. Ask the people of Delhi and they will tell you what the Congress did when we were in Delhi. We delivered. Delhi was progressing under Congress.Amarinder Singh has given his blood and sweat for Punjab.He has worked day and night for the betterment of Punjab.He has always worked for Punjabis, for Sardars. He is going to be our chief minister.Punjab has 'seva' in their tradition and culture.Guru Nanak ji spoke of seva and tera.  Guru Nanak ji had said sab ka sab tera.The Badals have converted that to sab ka sab mera.Modi ji says he is fighting corruption. He says he has done demonetisation.He says he will punish the corrupt. If that be the case, then please tell me how is he joining hands with the Badals? How can someone who says he's fighting the corrupt stand together with the Badals?People come here and say we'll solve Punjab's problems in 2 days, we'll find solutions in weeks and months.Tell me how that is possible? Do not believe them.Punjab's  problems will have to be solved with a lot of hard work by Amarinder Singh, by me, by us all. We all have to give our blood and sweat.Congress will deliver, not just make false promises of quick solutions.I told you all that Amarinder Singh will be the chief minister of Punjab.

State Congress chief Luizinho Faleiro said that in the first phase, casino boats that float in the Mandovi river would be shut down and in the second, onshore casinos would be targeted. The manifesto was released by former Congress Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in Panaji today.

Mr Faleiro said he did not fear that closing down casinos would affect jobs in the tiny tourist state. ""I don't think that there are many Goans working at these casinos,"" the Congress leader said.

Goa has six casino vessels and about a dozen onshore casinos that operate out of five star resorts. Together they contribute about 200 crore a year to the state revenue.

The Congress has earlier crossed swords with the state's ruling BJP over casinos which has asked why the party did not act against them when it was in power for two terms before the BJP returned.

The BJP had promised to shut down casinos when it was in the opposition and had floated that as a poll promise in 2012. After winning, however, it cited loss of revenue from a ban on mining for not closing casinos, but says that they ""haven't allowed any new casinos to come up and have not renewed any contracts."" All casinos, the BJP says, came up during Congress rule, but has been ambiguous on casinos in this election.

Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which makes its Goa debut, has taken a clear stance in its manifesto stating that it will shut down all casinos and will also provide alternative employment to close to 10,000 people employed by these.

All the parties peg their anti-casino stance on the ""degeneration of Goan culture"" that they allege these promote.

Goa votes on February 4 and after weeks of attempting an alliance with regional party Goa Forward, the Congress has announced that it will contest the assembly elections alone. It said on Saturday that it would contest 37 of the state's 40 seats.

In 2012, Goa threw out the Congress, with the party winning only seven seats. The BJP had won 21 of the 28 seats it had contested, a majority on its own. Then partner, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP had won three seats.

The MGP parted ways with the BJP earlier month soon after elections were announced."

Though she looks frail, and can't walk without a stick, Jal Devi has been working for her village, trying to get build concrete roads. Two years ago, she won the panchayat elections from Jagner block, defeating her 32-year-old rival by more than 9,000 votes.

""Our village and area has very bad roads and the officials don't care,"" she said.

The former PWD Minister, who enjoyed the number two status in the state government, has since fallen from grace of his nephew and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav after a bitter power struggle in the party and the first family.

He has been already axed as the state unit chief and replaced by Akhilesh loyalist Naresh Uttam and been relegated to a virtual nobody in the party.

What is set to add injury to insult is the fact that barring Shivpal Singh Yadav, all other members of the Yadav clan who are in active politics have been named in the list.

This includes party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, Rajya Sabha member Ram Gopal Yadav, Kannauj MP and wife of the Chief Minister Dimple Yadav, Budayun MP Dharmendra Yadav, Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Singh and Lok Sabha member from Firozabad Akshay Yadav. Others in the list are Kironmoy Nanda, Naresh Agarwal, Mohd Azam Khan, Surendra Nagar, Sanjay Lathar, Udayveer Singh, Kamaal Akhtar and Neeraj Shekhar.

Under pressure from the party's mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav, Shivpal Singh has however been given ticket from his traditional Jaswantnagar seat in Etawah.

Ms Singh is the daughter of Hukum Singh, a seven-time BJP legislator from the Kairana seat and presently its MP.

Her nomination, one of several seats given by the BJP to the children of its leaders, has raised eyebrows given the BJP's biting criticism of the dynastic Politics practised by its rivals.

Ms Singh is a political novice; she lives in Ghaziabad where she runs a school.

But she thinks she has a chance. ""The party may have assessed winnability factor as well,"" she tells NDTV.

Her father admits that his service to the party is one of the reasons why his daughter was selected.

""We never liked family in politics, but we can't deny them the rights also. If a member of the family deserves a political standing, then we shouldn't ignore him,"" said Hukum Singh.

But the Singh family may face an internal battle. The ticket to Mriganka has come at the cost of her own cousin, Anil Chauhan who contested the 2014 by-elections from a BJP ticket in Kairana but had lost with a very close margin.

Mr Chauhan has now joined the rival Rashtriya Lok Dal. He will be fighting against Ms Singh.

Both father and daughter however claim family politics is not the key issue. Law and order is, specifically the hounding out of mostly Hindu families from Kairana.

With these words Mr Singh has revived a controversy he had sparked last year by releasing lists of Hindu families, whom he claimed had left Kairana because of local Muslim criminal gangs. Kairana has a 50 per cent Muslim population.

Later, after the media had poked holes in those claims, Mr Singh said it was not a communal issue merely one of law and order.

He told NDTV on Wednesday that the list may have contained errors, but in election season that doesn't seem to have deterred him from reviving it.

""It (exodus) just happened because the entire business is in the hands of the Hindus: Vaishya, Jains, Brahmins. They are the easiest targets. They are peace loving. Some criminals who happen to be Muslims were terrorising them,"" said Mr Singh.

But are there no Muslim-run businesses in the area, similarly targeted? ""Muslims who are rich and who are running businesses were also targeted"", he added as an afterthought."
"'Don't Seek Votes In Name Of Religion, Caste': Election Commission To Parties","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dont-seek-votes-in-name-of-religion-caste-election-commission-to-parties-1652296","New Delhi:                             Don't seek votes in the name of religion and caste, the Election Commission warned political parties today ahead of polls in five states from February 4.

""Strictly follow the Supreme Court verdict, which said seeking votes in the name of religion, caste is a corrupt practice,"" the powerful election body said in a letter to all parties, directing them to ""instruct cadre to desist from soliciting votes in the name of religion and caste.""

The letter quotes extracts of the top court judgment.

In a separate letter to chief electoral officers of all states, the Commission said any activity of seeking votes in the name of religion and caste by or on behalf of any candidate or political party would now amount to violation of the provisions of the Mode Code of Conduct. The CEOs have been asked to inform the grassroots level election officials and ensure the compliance of the Supreme Court orders during elections.

Earlier this month, in a majority verdict, the Supreme Court held that appeal for votes on the ground of ""religion, race, caste, community or language"" amounted to ""corrupt practice"".

Referring to that order, the Election Commission said all parties should take note of it for ""strict compliance"".

""The political parties may also suitably brief and inform their lower formations and party cadres and all their candidates about the ruling of the Supreme Court and ask them to desist from any activities that would amount to soliciting votes in the name of religion, caste, etc in any manner, in their own interest and in the interest of the party. Such appeals may also fall within the ambit of... Model Code of Conduct,"" the letter to top bosses of all recognised national and state political parties said.

Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur will vote in assembly elections to be held in multiple phases between February 4 and March 8. The results will be announced on March 11.

"Uttarakhand Elections 2017: A Twist In The Tale As Chief Minister Harish Rawat Files Nomination For Kumaon Seat","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-elections-2017-a-twist-in-the-tale-as-chief-minister-harish-rawat-files-nomination-for-k-1653066","Dehradun:                             In the season of rebellion in the Congress ranks in Uttarakhand, Chief Minister Harish Rawat faced a peculiar situation as he filed nomination from the Kichcha Assembly constituency in Kumaon on Wednesday. A senior Congress leader, Shilpi Arora, resigned from the party with a tweet explaining why she was quitting and launching a ferocious attack on the Chief Minister.

""I was forced to leave party and left with no option except fighting against @harishrawatcmuk from Kichcha as Independent Candidate,"" Ms Arora, who has been with the Congress for over 20 years, tweeted. She alleges she was promised that the party would nominate her from one of the nine assembly constituencies in Udhum Singh Nagar and that she had even begun groundwork there. However, after her name did not feature in the list of Congress candidates she felt ""betrayed by the false promises"".

The 44-year-old entrepreneur-turned-politician has now vowed to ""turn into Goddess Durga in order to defeat such demons,"" referring to Mr Rawat, who she described as ""Mahishasura,"" a dreaded demon killed by the Goddess in mythology, for ""backtracking on his commitment.""

Shilpi Arora said she would file  her nomination from Kichcha on Friday, the same day that Harish Rawat files nomination from the second seat he in contesting - Haridwar Rural in Garhwal.

Party insiders say Ms Arora, a state general secretary of the Congress, is from Gadarpur in Udhum Singh Nagar district and had been eyeing a ticket from the region for some time now. In place of her, the Congress fielded Rajendra Singh from Gadarpur.

As an Independent candidate from Kichcha, Ms Arora could use her popularity and sympathy wave to wrest a significant amount of vote-share from Rawat, leading to a tough competition, if not a loss of face for the Chief Minister. As an Independent, Ms Arora even stands a chance of joining ranks with any political party that may choose to solicit her support to form government in case she wins.

The BJP has reposed faith in its sitting lawmaker Rajesh Shukla, from Kichcha, to take on the Chief Minister. The saffron party hopes to capitalise on the wave of anti-incumbency against the current government to return to power in the state after five years.

Disgruntled Congress leaders across the state are either joining other parties or turning rebel as ""Independent"" candidates just before the assembly elections hitting the party's prospect of returning to power.

Sarika Pardhan, who was a minister in the ND Tiwari government of 2002 has also decided to fight the elections as an Independent candidate after the Congress fielded Godavari Thapli from Mussoorie. In all such instances, unhappy leaders have blamed the Chief Minister for their being denied ticket.

Reacting to Ms Arora's allegations, Surendra Kumar, the Chief Minister's media advisor, said, ""Shilpi Arora is a long-time member of the party and a valued leader. She may have made the outburst in an emotional moment. But we are in talks with her and will resolve all her grievances"".

Uttarakhand votes on February 15. Votes will be counted on March 11."

At a high-level meeting recently, the Union Home Ministry has committed to provide 850 companies for the polls, official sources said.

A company of paramilitary force comprises around 100 personnel.

In addition to the central forces, a few lakh personnel belonging to state police forces and home guards of the respective state will also be deployed for election duties.

The Home Ministry is accumulating 150 companies, most of them from State Armed Police forces and India Reserve Battalions, from different states for election duties. Rest of the forces will be from central paramilitary forces, the sources said.

While majority of the forces will be deployed in Uttar Pradesh, where polling will be held in seven phases, a sizeable number will also be deployed in Manipur which continues to be on edge due to a blockade on a major national highway, the sources said.

Assembly elections in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa will be held in single phase and Manipur in two phases from February 4.

The list includes former Union minister Jitin Prasad and controversial leader Imran Masood. The party may come out with a second list soon.

Out of 41 candidates on the Congress list, eight are Muslims, which translates roughly to 20 per cent. This is in direct contrast to the two BJP lists, which do not any Muslim candidate so far.

Imran Masood, who was in the eye of a storm during 2014 Lok Sabha elections when a video clip emerged that allegedly showed him saying he would cut Narendra Modi into pieces if he ever came to his constituency. Masood was jailed for his alleged hate speech.

After an initial list of 41 candidates, the party's general secretary Madhusudan Mistry later released a list of two additional nominees cleared by the party's Central Election Committee (CEC), which includes Masud Akhtar from Saharanpur Nagar and Sherbaz Khan from Chandpur Assembly constituency.
 
The first list included these names:
 
Samajwadi Party and Congress sealed a pre-poll pact to contest the UP Assembly elections on Sunday, ending days of suspense and feverish parleys.

The alliance, which at one stage looked doomed with both sides driving a hard bargain, was announced by the chiefs of the state units of the two parties who declared while SP will have the lion's share of 298 of 403 seats, Congress will contest the remaining 105.

Uttar Pradesh goes to polls on February 11. Voting will be carried out in seven phases and will last till March 8.

"Arun Jaitley's 3 Reasons For BJP-Akali Winning Punjab Factors In AAP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-jaitleys-3-reasons-for-bjp-akali-winning-punjab-factors-in-aap-1651332","Amritsar:                             The addition of the Aam Aadmi Party in a traditionally bipolar contest will help the ruling BJP-Akali Dal alliance in the upcoming Punjab assembly elections next month, Union Minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said, also taking shots at ""absentee"" representatives in an apparent jab at cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu who defected to the Congress from his party.

Speaking in Amritsar on the campaign trail, Mr Jaitley, ""I have kept in touch with this city for a very long time not withstanding any election result. I do believe that Amritsar has had a very unfortunate experience over the past 12-and-a-half years of suffering from absentee MPs.""

The reference appeared to be a shot at Mr Sidhu, a three-time lawmaker elected from Amritsar who is often criticised by his opponents of abandoning the city for commercial interests in Mumbai. But countered over the 53-year-old's only recent separation from the BJP, Mr Jaitley said, ""Yes, we share the guilt for that and I'm not referring to only one, I'm referring to at least two who abstained from the city, and the constituency, who also abstained from parliament.""

Despite the 10-year-old regime fuelling anti-incumbency sentiments, Mr Jaitley said, he had three strong reasons to believe why the BJP-Akali combine would return to power. Besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi's continuing appeal and a general appreciation for the state government's performance, the entry of the Aam Aadmi Party would also help them divvying up the opposition to the ruling alliance, he said.

""Conventionally Punjab saw a direct election between Congress and the NDA (BJP-led National Democratic Alliance). This time there is a divided opposition to the NDA. Both the arithmetic and the chemistry will certainly dictate the election result,"" he said."

Union minister Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj Singh, the BJP's candidate from Noida, is ""200 per cent eligible,"" Mr Mathur said. 

After its multiple attacks on rivals like the Samajwadi Party and Congress for what it calls their ""dynastic politics,"" questions have been raised over the BJP's claim to being a party with a difference, given the number of relatives it is fielding in UP. This, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's firm no to family members of leaders contesting elections.

Mr Mathur told NDTV in an exclusive interview that reports of Rajnath Singh being upset at his son being overlooked as a BJP candidate in earlier elections were untrue. ""It is absolutely wrong to say that Rajnath Singh was angry and put pressure for a ticket for Pankaj Singh. I have seen Pankaj working for the party for 15 years now, he is an office-bearer. Pankaj Singh is 200% eligible to get a BJP ticket,"" the senior leader said. 

 As this reporter reeled off names of other sons and daughters that the BJP has announced as candidates in its first two UP lists - including the children and grandchildren of BJP leaders Lalji Tandon, Hukum Singh And Kalyan Singh - Mr Mathur said, ""All relatives given BJP tickets have worked for years - Lalji Tandon's son Gopal is a sitting lawmaker and has been fielded again.""The party also faces protests against new imports in the BJP being chosen as candidates over people who have worked in the party for years.  

Mr Mathur said the BJP has only allotted about 30 to 40 seats to those who have recently joined the party, roughly 10 per cent of the total seats announced, he said.  

Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who joined the BJP only three months ago after 24 years in the Congress, features in the list of 155 candidates declared yesterday, as does Brijesh Pathak, who recently joined the BJP after quitting Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party. Both will contest prestigious constituencies in state capital Lucknow.
  
About two dozen people who joined the party only recently had featured in the first list of 149 too, sparking protests. ""Outsiders are being given tickets only after pacifying BJP workers,"" insisted Mr Mathur."

"Nicknames Like Bhau, Boss, Baba, Babush, Miccky Rule Goa's Political Canvas","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nicknames-like-bhau-boss-baba-babush-miccky-rule-goas-political-canvas-1651592","Panaji:                             As Goa gears up for Assembly elections on February 4, candidate nicknames like 'Babush', 'Baba', 'Patrao', 'Bhau', 'Miccky', 'Boss' and 'Khashe' have made a splash on the political canvas in the state.

The nickname 'Babush' which means baby boy in Portuguese language is shared by two prominent politicians - Deputy Chief Minister Fransic D'Souza and controversial former minister Atanasio Monserratte.

Mr D'Souza is contesting on a BJP ticket from Mapusa constituency and Mr Monserratte is challenging Manohar Parrikar-led BJP in his fiefdom of Panaji constituency.

Mr Monserratte who was expelled from the Congress has formed his own political outfit - United Goans Party.

'Babu', which also means baby boy, is associated with two prominent politicians who are famous more for their nicknames than their real names.

Congress legislator Chandrakant Kavlekar is known as Babu Kavlekar in his constituency. Similarly, former minister Manohar Asgaonkar is also known as Babu or Babu Asgaonkar.

Mr Asgaonkar, a former Congress legislator, had switched party loyalties in the last minute to join the MGP. He is now contesting from Pernem constituency against BJP minister Rajendra Arlekar. The constituency is reserved for Scheduled Castes.

In the remote Sattari taluka, Baba and Khashe are two names which are taken with due respect. 'Baba' is a nickname for Congress legislator Vishwajit Rane contesting from Valpoi constituency while his father and former Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane is referred to as 'Khashe'.

'Khashe' is usually a name for referring to a person who owns large tracts of land in Sattari taluka, located in the North Eastern part of the State.

'Bhau' and 'Bhayi' are two common names uttered in BJP circles. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar is known as 'Bhayi' meaning brother across the state amongst BJP cadres, while Union AYUSH minister Shripad Naik is referred to as 'Bhau' meaning elder brother.

Incidentally, former Congress legislator Pandurang Madkaikar who recently joined the BJP is also known as 'Bhau' in his constituency.

Former State Home Minister Ravi Naik who is contesting on Congress ticket in Ponda constituency is popularly known as 'Patrao', which in Portuguese means 'owner'.

Congress candidate from Canacona Isidore Fernandes is referred to as 'Boss', the nickname which he prominently displays on his vehicles.

Controversial former minister Fransisco Pacheco who is now contesting on Goa Su Raj party ticket from Nuvem constituency is famous as 'Miccky', the nickname which he shares with AAP Panaji candidate Walmiki Naik."
"Akhilesh Yadav's List Of 191 Samajwadi Party Candidates Includes Uncle Shivpal Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadavs-list-of-190-candidates-includes-uncle-shivpal-yadav-1650828","New Delhi: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav was declared party chief over father by poll authority
Mulayam Singh in meetings with Akhilesh Yadav had sought seats for 38
Akhilesh's list includes Shivpal, leaves out Mulayam's other close aides
                                Estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav has made Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's first list of 191 Samajwadi Party candidates, but several other close associates of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav have been left out. The candidates were announced today ahead of a formal announcement of the party's alliance for the Uttar Pradesh election with the Congress. The ruling party's first list of candidates covers the first three phases of the UP elections, which will be held in seven phases beginning February 11. The Samajwadi Party has said it will contest 300 of UP's 403 seats, with the balance being allotted to the Congress.

Akhilesh Yadav's list corrects an earlier list of candidates that his father Mulayam Singh Yadav had released last month, which left out several of the chief minister's key aides. Those associates like Atul Pradhan and Arvind Singh Gope are being fielded by the party now.

Senior minister Azam Khan, who played mediator between father and son in their bitter power struggle in the last few weeks, will contest again from his constituency Rampur. His son Abdullah Azam makes his debut as a Samajwadi Party candidate from Swaar. Both had also featured in Mulayam Singh's list of candidates.

But Shivpal Yadav's son Aditya has not been given a ticket by cousin Akhilesh Yadav. Mulyam Singh loyalists like current lawmakers Raghuraj Shakhya and Sukh Devi Verma have been dropped.

Today's list also leaves out candidates like Atiq Ahmed, a gangster-turned-politician with multiple criminal cases against him. He had earlier been announced as a Samajwadi Party candidate by Mulayam Singh at the behest of Shivpal Yadav, even though Akhilesh Yadav had strongly opposed fielding him.

Shivpal Yadav, who will contest Jaswantnagar, the constituency he represents, is in many ways the crux of the feud between the Chief Minister and his father Mulayam Singh. In the months before the crucial UP elections, Shivpal Yadav had challenged the Chief Minister on key decisions and was consistently backed by Mulayam Singh.

Last month, Akhilesh Yadav had announced his own candidates in defiance of his father's list and was later declared Samajwadi Party president by his supporters in place of his father at a party meeting.  

Earlier this week, the Election Commission recognised Mr Yadav as the party's president and granted him use of the party's cycle symbol rejecting his father's claim. After the poll panel's order, Mulayam Singh had handed his son a list of 38 candidates that he wants the party to field, among them Shivpal Yadav."
"Samajwadi-Congress Alliance In Trouble, Tussle Over Minority-Dominated Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/samajwadi-congress-alliance-in-trouble-tussle-over-minority-dominated-seats-1651217","Lucknow: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav's list of candidates left the Congress upset. 
Akhilesh Yadav is reportedly talking to Congress to sort out differences.
Congress was voted out of power in UP by Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989.
                                The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance which was promising to alter the political equations for assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is in trouble with both sides calling the other's demands for more seats unreasonable.

Amidst building tension, sources in the Samajwadi Party say that all is not over and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is holding talks with Congress leaders through back channels to iron out the differences. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi met sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad at his residence today.

At the heart of the trouble are two key issues - how many seats will each get and which seat will go to which party.

The two parties had sent out all the right signals till Monday last. But when the two camps sat down for seat-sharing talks, trouble erupted. Senior Samajwadi Party leaders today indicated that Akhilesh Yadav, who has already announced 210 candidates - some even on seats held by Congress legislators - may announce more candidates over the next 24 hours, since the time is running out and nominations for the first phase end on January 24.

The chief minister is not waiting for the alliance to be thorough in more ways. Tomorrow, Akhilesh Yadav will release his party's manifesto in Lucknow.

Sensing trouble, top Congress leaders have rushed to Lucknow. The Congress, which has been reduced to player number 4 in Uttar Pradesh, is eyeing the alliance to recover ground. While senior Samajwadi leaders maintain that the Congress does not have the footprint strength to demand nearly 130 seats, the Congress says anything less will hurt the national party's interest. Samajwadi Party sources say the alliance is not taking off as the Congress wants it to surrender some seats it had won in 2012.

However, insiders say that the real tussle is over seats where minority vote holds sway. The Congress was edged out of power in Uttar Pradesh by Akhilesh Yadav's father Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989. The rise of Mullah Mulayam brought the drift of minority vote to the Samajwadi Party from the Congress.

While the Samajwadi Party is keen to maintain its most favoured party status among Muslims, the Congress wants to regain lost ground via the alliance."
"Rajnath Singh's Son, Rita Bahuguna Joshi In BJP Second List For UP Elections","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rajnath-singhs-son-rita-bahuguna-joshi-on-bjp-second-list-for-up-elections-1651469","Lucknow: HighlightsBJP has, so far, named 304 candidates of Uttar Pradesh's 403 seats
The second list includes family members of many BJP leaders and veterans
Rajnath Singh's son, Pankaj Singh, will contest from Noida constituency
                                New imports and relatives of senior politicians continue to feature among the BJP's candidates for the Uttar Pradesh elections despite heartburn in party ranks and even protests against the party fielding ""outsiders"" earlier this week.

A second list of 155 candidates announced today includes Pankaj Singh, the son of union Home Minster Rajnath Singh and Mriganka Singh, the daughter of party MP from Uttar Pradesh, Hukum Singh. The new list also names Rita Bahuguna Joshi as the candidate from Lucknow Cantt.

Ms Joshi, a former Congress chief from the state, joined the BJP only in October, 2016. Lucknow Cantt is the seat she won in 2012 and this year's contest could pitch her against Aparna Yadav, the second daughter-in-law of Mulayam Singh Yadav, if the Samajwadi Party fields her from the constituency.

Brijesh Pathak, another leader who recently joined the BJP after quitting Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party has been been given a ticket from Lucknow Central.  

Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's firm no to family members of party men contesting elections, the BJP received requests to accommodate almost 50 sons, daughters and other relatives from BJP leaders for this year's UP elections, to be held in seven phases from February 11. The first list had included Sandeep Singh, grandson of former chief minister Kalyan Singh - now the governor of Rajasthan.  

Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj will contest as the BJP candidate from Noida. Pankaj Singh wanted to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but was not fielded by the BJP then. But he has been active in politics and has also held party positions.

It is Mriganka Singh's candidacy from Kairana that is expected to cause the dismay in a party that celebrates ""one party, one post."" Mriganka Singh is a political novice and already a senior BJP leader Anil Chauhan has quit the party last week protesting against the plan to field her.

Ashutosh Tandon, the son of BJP veteran Lalji Tandon has been fielded again from Lucknow North, the seat he had won in 2012. Mr Tandon's candidacy had in the last election raised allegations of the BJP indulging in the dynastic politics it accuses rivals like the Congress and Samajwadi Party of.

Another son and ""outsider"" in today's list is Utkarsh Maurya, the son of Swami Prasad Maurya who crossed over from the BSP six months ago. About two dozen people who joined the party only recently had featured in the first list of 149, sparking protests. A meeting to decide on the second list had to be delayed.

The BJP had won only 47 seats in the last assembly election but sees its best chance in years to win UP again after sweeping 71 of states 80 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections."

They didn't come in peace. Loud slogan-shouting erupted within seconds. Despite Mr Shah's warning to party men not to lobby for or protest against candidates for next month's state elections, the BJP is facing minor mutinies several times a day.

Today's first group of protesters was from Dhaulana town in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP has named Ramesh Chandra Tomar as its candidate. YP Singh was the party's choice in the previous polls. His supporters loudly and relentlessly tried to seize Mr Shah's attention. They are angry that Dharmesh Tomar, a turn-coat, has been named BJP candidate. Mr Tomar won the seat in the previous 2012 state polls as a Samajwadi candidate, reducing the BJP's YP Singh to a poor third. The BJP is seen to be betting on caste equations by fielding Mr Tomar.

The second group of ""rebels"" was from Amroha, also in UP. The protesters shouted slogans for Devendra Nagpal, who says he has been denied a chance in the Naugavan constituency.

The BJP has chosen ex-cricketer Chetan Chauhan, who represented the Amroha parliamentary seat long ago but is now being dubbed an ""outsider"" by Mr Nagpal's loyalists.

Tarsem Singh, a BJP worker holding a protest placard, said, ""The local BJP's views have not been considered. Mr Chauhan has no chance of winning as he has not been in Amroha since his term as MP ended. ''

The protestor alleges that the party has set up a walkover for the Samajwadi Party's Mehboob, a four-term MP, by choosing Mr Chauhan.

The shouting bunch finally got a hearing with the BJP's points person for the Uttar Pradesh polls, senior leader Om Mathur.

In the last three days, at least 10 groups have challenged the choices made by the party's central election committee headed by Amit Shah, which includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The incessant protests reflect that the party's effort to add leaders from rival parties is backfiring and also threatens to upset caste calculations.

Yesterday, another group of protestors from UP were assured that the party will not field a turncoat from Noida, like in the case of Dadri and Jewar.

In Dadri, the BJP is fielding Tejpal Nagar, 58, and in Jewar, 50-year-old Dhirendra Singh is the candidate. They are both recent recruits, taken not before 2014.

Akhilesh Yadav Gets Call","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sp-maurya-who-left-mayawatis-party-for-bjp-calls-akhilesh-yadav-1650304","Lucknow:                             Swamy Prasad Maurya, strategically poached by the BJP from Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party only six months ago in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh election, is said to be evaluating another change of party. There is speculation that the politician, who is said to command significant support from some sections of UP's Other Backward Caste or OBC voters, is unhappy with the party's selection of candidates for next month's assembly elections and could join Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party.

Mr Maurya told NDTV that he has been in touch with Akhilesh Yadav and offered fulsome praise for the 43-year-old UP Chief Minister. ""I congratulated him for his victory...He is a young and dynamic leader and a very good human being. We share a very good personal relationship,"" Mr Maurya said, referring to Mr Yadav winning the use of the Samajwadi Party name and symbol in a feud with his father Mulayam Singh Yadav and uncle Shivpal Yadav.

He was equally candid about his problems in the BJP. ""I am struggling to get ticket for supporters from my community who moved from the BSP with me,"" he said, very clear that he is asking for his due share. The former BSP man is said to have demanded 35 of UP's 403 seats for him and his supporters, including a son and a daughter, to contest. The BJP, sources said, is willing to concede no more than five.

The BJP had inducted Mr Maurya last August as it sought to consolidate voters belonging to different sections and communities for the mega UP elections, being pegged as a semi-final before 2019 national election.

Mr Maurya draws his support from the Maurya, Kushwaha, Saini and Shakya communities. He was Leader of Opposition in the UP assembly before he quit the BSP, accusing Ms Mayawati of ""selling assembly ticket to candidates.""

Other parties are said to have approached Mr Maurya too at that time and there was talk of negotiations with the Samajwadi Party. The BJP had won, but as Mr Maurya had joined the party in Delhi he had asked it to treat his supporters well. Some had joined with him and many more would follow, he had promised."
"Congress Rejects Akhilesh Yadav's Final Offer Of 99 Seats, Alliance Nearly Over","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congress-rejects-akhilesh-yadavs-offer-of-99-seats-alliance-with-samajwadi-party-in-trouble-1651261","New Delhi: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav's list of candidates left the Congress upset
Congress seeks 110 seats, rejects final offer by Akhilesh, say sources
Congress was voted out of power in UP by Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989
                                The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance which was promising to alter the political equations for Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh is in trouble. Hectic negotiations for the last few days hit a wall on Friday when both sides, off the record, called the other's demand for more seats unreasonable. Amidst building tension, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav started talks with Congress leaders through back channels to iron out the differences since Saturday morning.

At the heart of the trouble were two key issues - how many seats will each get and which seat will go to which party.

By evening the talks were stalled once again. Akhilesh Yadav, who started bargaining from not more than 85 seats in the morning made the final offer by late afternoon. He has now put them all in the Congress's court by agreeing to give 99 of the 403 seats to the Congress. But the Congress wants nothing less than 104 - it had asked for 110.

The two parties had sent out all the right signals till Monday last. But when the two camps sat down for seat sharing talks trouble erupted. Senior Samajwadi Party leaders today indicated that Akhilesh Yadav who has already announced 210 candidates - some even on seats held by Congress legislators - may announce few more if talks fail as time is running out and nominations for the first phase are ending on January 24.

The chief minister is not waiting for the alliance to be through in more ways. Tomorrow, Akhilesh Yadav will be releasing his party's manifesto in Lucknow.

Sensing tie-up trouble, top Congress leaders had rushed to Lucknow. The Congress which has been reduced to player number four in Uttar Pradesh was eyeing the alliance to recover ground. While senior Samajwadi Party leaders maintain that the Congress doesn't have the footprint strength to initially demand nearly 130 seats, the Congress says anything less will hurt the national party's interests.

Samajwadi Party sources say the alliance is not taking off as the Congress wants it to surrender some seats it had won in 2012.

However, insiders say that the real tussle is over seats where minority vote holds sway. The Congress was edged out of power in Uttar Pradesh by Akhilesh Yadav's father Mulayam Singh Yadav in 1989. The rise of 'Mullah Mulayam' brought the drift of minority vote to the Samajwadi Party from the Congress. While the Samajwadi Party is keen to maintain its most favoured party status among Muslims, the Congress wants to regain lost ground via the alliance."
"A Small Village In Uttar Pradesh Makes A Big Election Pledge","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/a-small-village-in-uttar-pradesh-makes-a-big-election-pledge-1651110","Chandaur village, Banda district, Uttar Pradesh:                             Almost all the 4,500 residents of Chandaur, a small village in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, are gathered in front of the primary school to discuss the assembly elections in the state, but within minutes it turns into a full-fledged protest. The villagers are angry with the lotus, the hand, the cycle, the elephant and every other symbol that represents a political party. None, they say, have done any work for them. The sitting MLA here, is from the Bahujan Samaj Party.

One by one, villagers take the microphone, their voices filled with anguish and anger at an electoral process which they feel merely exploits their vote. Their message now - Chandaur will not vote.

Anand Kumar, a young daily wager says for years young men in this village have struggled to get an education. When they do get an education, they don't get jobs. Like Shiv Bodhan, who is in his thirties and has a Masters degree in Arts but is unemployed. ""What's the point of our degrees when to get jobs you need to have money to bribe people? Politicians tell us they will focus on the youth but our ears have tired of listening to these lies,"" Bodhan says, adding, ""We don't have a job, they don't have a vote.""

Malkhan Lal, who works on farms and as labour, thrusts a sheaf of papers at us to show how many court cases are pending here. ""We're from a poor village in Bundelkhand, so no judge, no lawyer is interested in us or our cases. Whether it is about land or about the identification required for ration cards, we have been fighting just to get our basic entitlements. Yet each elections, like mules we would go to vote. No more.""

Years of drought have pushed the people of Chandaur into desperate poverty and helplessness. 70-year-old Gujaratiya says she can't vote for people who don't care whether she lives or dies. ""I have two children who are waiting to be married but who can think of marriage when we go hungry for days."" Every election, Gujaratiya says, she ""would obediently go to vote,"" but now believes that ""This democracy is for rich people not us.""

Village pradhan Ramchandar, who is in his fifties, says it is ironic that Chandaur's election boycott has drawn the attention of local politicians and journalists, but its hardships never did. ""I am with my people on this. All 4,500 of us will not vote in these elections,"" he says.

Unlike other villages, which have announced a boycott of elections and later turned up to vote, Ramchandar says, ""It will not happen here.""

"Samajwadi Party Meets Congress Halfway In Gandhi Turf","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-meets-congress-halfway-in-gandhi-turf-1651519","Lucknow: HighlightsCongress and SP will contest 5 seats each in Amethi and Raebareli
Congress and SP formally announced an alliance for the UP polls on Sunday
Congress will contest 105 of the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh
                                The Samajwadi Party and the Congress will contest five assembly seats each in Uttar Pradesh's Raebareli and Amethi, which are the respective parliamentary constituencies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi. The 10 assembly seats in the Gandhi turf were said to have been a key point of disagreement in intense negotiations between the two parties, which formally announced their alliance for the upcoming UP elections on Sunday.

The Samajwadi Party has announced candidates for three of five seats in Raebareli and two of five seats in Amethi. The rest have been allotted to the Congress to contest.

In the 2012 assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party had won seven of the 10 seats whereas the Congress won two. Of the five seats that the Congress will contest this time, it had placed second to the Samajwadi Party in one seat and won two. Now, the Congress is contesting Raebareli for the seats where the independent had won.

The Congress and SP were expected to announce their alliance on Friday but reportedly could not agree on how many, and which, seats would each party contest. Talks, however, broke down when Akhilesh Yadav announced Samajwadi Party candidates for nine seats that the Congress had won in the last elections.

""It was never about Raebareli and Amethi,"" said senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday, insisting that the Congress had not made a prestige point about those seats.

""We wanted a certain number of seats and become part of the alliance with respect. Of the 10 seats now, we have half, they have half,"" he said.

In the alliance announced on Sunday, the Congress will contest 105 seats, up six from the 99 that Akhilesh Yadav had offered on Saturday.

Mr Azad, who is the Congress leader in charge of UP, credited Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the daughter of party chief Sonia Gandhi for the alliance coming through.

""I want to congratulate Priyanka Gandhiji for her efforts. It's a very difficult thing to form an alliance after years of contesting against each other,"" Mr Azad said.

Another senior leader Ahmed Patel had tweeted on Sunday morning:Ms Vadra had, so far, confined her political activity to her mother and brother's constituencies. In 2012, she had vowed to deliver a perfect 10 in Rae Bareli and Amethi. The Samajwadi Party, however, had upset those plans."
"'Don't Know If Alliance On,' Says Congress After Samajwadi Googly","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dont-know-if-alliance-on-says-congress-after-samajwadi-googly-1650924","Lucknow:                             Hours before a formal announcement was expected, an alliance appeared untenable on Friday after the Samajwadi Party named candidates for seven Uttar Pradesh seats that the Congress currently holds and a senior leader of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's party said that it could offer its potential partner only 80 to 85 of UP's 403 assembly seats.

""No alliance at the cost of Congress workers' self-respect,"" said the party's state chief Raj Babbar, refusing to say whether the alliance with the Samajwadi Party is on or not. Mr Babbar was expected to announce the alliance this evening with his Samajwadi Party counterpart Naresh Uttam.

""We are a big party and we cannot compromise on our workers' interest,"" Mr Babbar said.

There has so far been talk of the Samajwadi Party wanting to contest 300 of UP's 403 seats and allotting the rest to the Congress. But the Samajwadi Party's Kiranmoy Nanda today said the Congress should ideally be given no more than 54 seats to contest. ""Other than that we can give them 30-35 seats...First let the alliance happen,"" he said, emphasising that, ""We haven't received anything from the Congress side yet.""

84 to 85 seats, Mr Nanda said, was his party's best offer to the potential ally, whose top leaders had earlier this week said that the Congress will contest the UP elections in partnership with the Samajwadi Party. Only a formal announcement was awaited.

""The Samajwadi Party's key agenda is to defeat the BJP, while the Congress wants to strengthen its position in UP,"" Mr Nanda said. 

There has been speculation that the Samajwadi Party could balance today's seat allotment by giving the Congress more seats to contest in the Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Lok Sabha constituencies of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi, but Mr Nanda ruled that concession out too. The Samajwadi Party, he pointed out, holds seven out 10 assembly seats in that area, and would field winning candidates from there.

The Samajwadi Party has named 191 candidates today for constituencies where elections will be held in the first three phases of the seven-phase UP election. 

The Congress had won 29 seats in the last assembly elections in UP."

The opposition party said it has not stitched a formal alliance, but has only entered into a seat-sharing pact with Goa Forward, launched a year ago, and others for the February 4 elections.

""This is not an alliance. This is purely a seat-sharing agreement that we are having based on winnability of candidates,"" All India Congress Committee General Secretary Digvijay Singh told PTI.

Under the arrangement, Congress has left two seats - Fatorda and Siolim - for Goa Forward. Vijai Sardesai, the fledgling outfit's mentor, is contesting from Fatorda.

Congress has agreed to let its expelled legislator Atanasio Monserratte, who has floated his own outfit United Goan Party, fight from from the Panaji seat.

Independent legislator Rohan Khaunte will be supported by Congress in the Porvorim constituency.

""We want to defeat the BJP which ran a Government of U turns,"" Mr Singh said, adding that his party is supporting these non-Congress candidates to defeat BJP.

Congress had earlier ruled out aligning with NCP, a former partner which asked for two seats - Benaulim and Vasco.

However, Congress and Goa Forward candidates will face each other in Saligao and Velim segments, where the two parties have no understanding."

The decision was taken at a meeting of the party's central election committee, chaired by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, in New Delhi on January 21.

State ministers Indira Hridyesh, Surendra Singh and Dinesh Aggarwal will contest from Haldwani, Kotdwar and Dharampur constituencies respectively. Other Congress leaders included in the list are Mantri Prasad Naihani, Harish Chandra Durgapal and Goving Singh Kunjwal who have been respectively fielded from Deoprayag, Lalkuwa and Jageshwar.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat has been fielded from Kiccha and Haridwar Rural constituencies.

The Uttarakhand polls will be a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress. According to news agency PTI, both parties are seeking a mandate on the agenda of development. Chief Minister Harish Rawat will also that the BJP-led Centre had dismissed the Congress-led state government till it was restored by the judiciary. The Congress has also roped in political strategist Prashant Kishor, whom Mr Rawat described as 'Chyawanprash', for the Uttarakhand polls.

""Kishor is like Chyawanprash... People resort to such tonics as they age,"" MR Rawat was quoted, by PTI, as saying.

Many senior Congress leaders from the state, including former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, resigned from the party to join the BJP. However, the BJP's decision to field these ex-Congressmen from various constituencies has led to resentment among the senior BJP leaders from the state including Om Gopal Rawat, Asha Nautiyal and Shailendra Singh Rawat.

Sai moved an application before Additional Sessions Judge PS Gadhvi, stating he could contest on two seats--Sahibabad in Ghaziabad district and Shivpur in Varanasi.

Seeking the relief, he stated that Ojaswi Party, of which he is one of the founders, wants to field candidates in the elections and that he needs to be out of jail to oversee the preparations.

The court kept the matter for hearing on January 21. Sai was arrested for allegedly raping a Surat-based woman disciple of his father between 2002 and 2005. Seven persons, including Sai and his aides were charged under sections of Indian Penal Code for rape, unnatural sex, molestation, wrongful confinement, unlawful assembly, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy.

The woman had accused Sai of repeated sexual assault when she was living at Asaram's ashram in Surat.

The victim's elder sister had also made similar allegation against Sai's father Asaram while she was living at an ashram on the outskirts of Ahmedabad between 1997 and 2006.

The two sisters had lodged separate complaints against Sai and Asaram for allegedly raping them.

He was arrested near the Delhi-Haryana border in December 2013 after evading law for two months following registration of the case against him.

Sai has been lodged at Lajpore Central Jail in Surat since December 2013.

Asaram is also facing trial in rape cases and lodged in a jail in Jodhpur."

""They are opposing triple talaq. BJP has already been given talaq twice in the Delhi and Bihar polls.

 He accused the Centre of ""unleashing a financial emergency"" in the name of demonetisation and claimed that the move was expected to have a bearing on the country's economic growth.

Meanwhile, CPI general secretary Suravaram Sudhakar Reddy said the NDA government did not take any step to arrest the likes of Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya, while BJP leader Gali Janardhan Reddy was not arrested, in spite of spending a huge amount on his daughter's wedding after the currency ban.

Assembly Elections were just four months away, but Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Suresh Prabhu, Piyush Goel promised Bengal a bonanza.

This time, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley did not attend the summit, even though his name was number four on the invitation card to the opening session, after President Pranab Mukherjee, Governor Kesari Nath Tripathi and Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal.

Given the head-on confrontation between Mamata Banerjee and PM Narendra Modi on demonetisation, no one is surprised at the turn of events.

However, the star of the show, President Pranab Mukherjee fully backed his host's bid to woo business to Bengal and sent out a message to her and to the missing guest, Arun Jaitley.

""When I was sent the invitation to attend the meet, I thought whether it will be proper to do that as President of the republic. But I felt that as India has cooperative federalism, it lays on the strength of every state. India's strength lies in cooperative federalism especially when it comes to economic development,"" he said.

Business delegations came in from 29 countries, 350 of them from Germany, South Korea, Poland and from across India.

""As businessmen I am disappointed. Last year Mr Jaitley had said India's progress depends on the states progress all together,"" said Rajeev Kaul, NICCO chairman.

""We are facing hardship because of demonetisation and remonetisation. Come to Bengal. We are giving relief to industry,"" said Ms Banerjee.

Another little bump was a wildcat protest outside the venue on Bhangar, where two people were shot dead on Tuesday during protests over alleged land grab.

The state government has staunchly denied that the clash was over land-grab. There were barely a hundred people at the protest, but due to the emotive issue, the chief minister was not pleased. But the state BJP was, not just about the Bhangar protest by the Left but also because they had urged party top brass to skip the summit. And they had been heard."

Earlier this month, addressing an election rally in Goa's Benaulim, Mr Kejriwal had said, ""If Congress or BJP candidates offer money, do not refuse it. Accept it as your own money. But when it comes to voting, press the button against the name of the AAP candidate.""

Mr Kejriwal, calling the Election Commission order wrong, said he will challenge it in court. ""EC order agnst me completely wrong. Lower court gave order in my favor. EC ignored court's order. Will challenge EC's latest order in court (sic),"" Mr Kejriwal tweeted in his defence.

The Election Commission, which had sent a notice to Mr Kejriwal earlier this week, had said that, prima facie, it is of the opinion that Mr Kejriwal's statements at the rally violated the Model Code of Conduct which came into force in Goa on January 4. It said that the Delhi Chief Minister's statement amounts to ""abetting and promoting electoral offence of bribery"". It further said that strict action will be taken should Mr Kejriwal fail to respond by the afternoon of January 19.

The Congress had taken offence to Mr Kejriwal's comments and had demanded the Election Commission to take action.

""Kejriwal's appeal to the people to take money from all political parties and vote for AAP is a clear case of inducing people to be corrupt. This is an insult to the sensitive voters from Goa,"" Congress spokesperson Trajano D'Mello had said.

Governments not allowed to make populist move to sway voters before polls
                                The government's annual budget will not be moved from February 1 to after the elections in states like Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court ruled today.

The petitioner, an advocate named ML Sharma, had argued that the centre could seek to influence the outcome of the polls with populist spending promises. Election rules do not allow governments to offer giveaways or make any announcements that could skew voters towards the party in power at the centre or in states.

But the court today said that the union budget has ""nothing to do with states "" and stressed that elections in states are held so often that they cannot impede the work of the centre. ""Throughout the year, there may be elections in different states, so should the centre  not present the budget?"" judges asked.

 The Finance Ministry began printing the budget documents last week.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government announced last autumn that it would deliver its budget a month earlier than usual for the 2017/18 financial year. The budget session of parliament will start on January 31 when the government is expected to present the Economic Survey, which sets the scene for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's fourth annual budget.

The cabinet decided last September to merge the railway budget with the annual budget, ending a nearly century-long practice. It also advanced the date of the general budget, usually the last working day in February, to ensure proposals take effect from April 1.

The five state elections begin on February 4 in  Punjab and Goa on February 4, followed by Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh (which votes on seven days)  and Manipur. Results for all will be announced on March 11."

Mr Maken's comments came after top Congress leaders held emergency meetings in Delhi to discuss whether and how to salvage the partnership with Akhilesh Yadav, that, both parties have for days declared as almost finalised. While Rahul Gandhi, Congress Vice President met his sister Priyanka at his home, other senior party leaders held a separate meeting.

Akhilesh Yadav scripted a major plot twist earlier today when he released a list of Samajwadi Party candidates for 191 seats, including seven currently held by Congress legislators. In another list of 18 that he released later, two Congress seats were listed.

Naturally, the Congress would like to retain those constituencies among the share that it would get as part of an alliance. But Akhilesh Yadav, who is seeking re-election as Chief Minister, is, according to sources, putting the squeeze on the Congress, which, without his partnership, stands far removed from the contest for the key state of Uttar Pradesh, with a stack of electoral defeats both in the last state election in 2012 and the general election two years later.

Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party has said that of the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh, it wants its own nominees to contest more than 300. The Congress should ideally get 54 seats, said SP leader Kiranmoy Nanda today, adding ""another 30 to 35"" at the most - which would give the Congress about 80 or 85 as opposed to the 100 it wants.

The last 48 hours have proved rough for what was being billed as the Grand Alliance or Maha Gathbandhan of Uttar Pradesh, a grouping of non-BJP parties modelled on the coalition that won Bihar in 2015. Ajit Singh and his Rashtriya Lok Dal or RLD, a party with a strong grip on the Jats, especially in Western Uttar Pradesh (which votes ahead of other parts), have decided against teaming with the Congress and Akhilesh Yadav, again because of smaller share of seats than desired.  

No sweat, retorted the Samajwadi Party, stressing that any association with the RLD could damage its standing among loyal Muslim supporters in Western UP, who are wary of Jats after the communal riots of 2013 which left nearly 60 people dead and several thousands homeless."

BJP's UP executive member Neeraj Shankar Saxena moved a petition against Mayawati on Saturday demanding that her party be debarred from contesting polls and filing of FIR against her for ""flouting"" Supreme Court directives.
    
""Mayawati during her press conference on December 24 and January 3 presented caste-wise details of ticket distribution clearly stating that her party has given tickets to how many Muslims, backwards, SCs and others,"" Mr Saxena told PTI.
    
Besides, her party men are distributing booklets titled ""Muslim samaj ka sachcha hitaishi kaun-faisla aap karein"" in all the constituencies, he claimed, adding this too was against the Supreme Court directives that votes cannot be sought on the basis of caste, community or language.
    
On January 3, Mayawati had said in a press conference that of the 403 seats, 85 are reserved for the SCs and 87 tickets have been given to Dalits, 97 to Muslims, 106 to OBCs, 66 to Brahmins, 36 to Kshetriyas and 11 to Kayasthas, Vaishyas and Punjabis.
    
The Supreme Court in its ruling last week had said religion and caste cannot be used to seek votes and made it clear that religion has no role in the electoral process and that it is just a secular activity."
"Arvind Kejriwal In Punjab's Malwa To Unite Factions, Reach Out To Voters","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-in-punjabs-malwa-to-unite-factions-reach-out-to-voters-1648293","Patiala:                             The Aam Aadmi Party's campaign in Punjab is full swing with party chief Arvind Kejriwal on a 5-day tour of the Malwa region. Despite having a model in next-door Delhi, where the party swept the assembly polls in 2015, the AAP chief his task cut out: In face of severe factionalism, he has to unite the party cadre, hold public meetings with local candidates and reach out to the voters.

The Akali-BJP combine is facing anti-incumbency after two consecutive tenures, and corruption and drug menace are key election issues. In that backdrop, AAP has a clean image and first-time candidates.

Its candidate for Nabha seat, Dev Maan, is the son of a man who owns a small cycle repair shop.
 
The Congress's sitting legislator -- four-time winner Sadho Singh Dharamsood - is carrying out a high-profile campaign with a cavalcade of cars.  

Dev, 44, is on foot. Much like AAP's election model in Delhi, he is going door-to-door. On their lips of his supporters is the party's latest campaign song: ""Ghaaru wala button dabado... Badal ko bhagado (press the button with the broom on it, get rid of the (state's ruling family) the Badals"".

""People are fed up. They have lost hope and want change. We will show them how without money and without bribes, elections can be won,"" said Dev's 80-yr-old father Lal Singh, who earns barely Rs. 4,000 per month.

Battling poverty through the years, the family has managed to send one son abroad. The other, they hope, will change things for the better -- for everyone.

""There are no jobs... I have spent my life with these repair parts, kids have no option but to be drawn to drugs,"" says Lal Singh.

It is people like him who are standing in Arvind Kejriwal's rallies, shouting and cheering, hoping for a change. Mr Kejriwal's Delhi model enthralls them. The Delhi Chief Minister plays along - with his strongest card.

""I am told the Captain (state Congress chief Amarinder Singh, who is from Patiala) hasn't opened a single new school or college in Patiala... AAP in Delhi has advanced government school to the degree that people prefer public over private schools now,"" he says.

While AAP campaign in Delhi was crafted around the educated urban voter, here he has promises for the rural folk. ""We waived off all farmer loans in Delhi. We will do the same for you,"" he adds.  

The Congress is fighting back, tagging Mr Kejriwal an outsider. Some agree.

""I haven't decided, everyone makes promises before elections that are difficult to trust,"" said one of the locals."
"Congress' Digambar Kamat First To File Nomination For Goa Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/goa-news/congress-digambar-kamat-first-to-file-nomination-for-goa-polls-1648177","Panaji:                             Former Goa Chief Minister and Congress leader Digambar Kamat today became the first candidate to file his nomination papers for the February 4 Assembly elections in the State.

The sitting MLA from Margao submitted papers to election officials on the second day of filing nominations. On the first day, no nomination was received.

The former Chief Minister walked to the election office soon after Congress in New Delhi released a list of 27 candidates, which included his name along with those of five other sitting legislators.

""I am not worried. Let there be any number of candidates contesting against me. Margao voters have always given me their support and love,"" Mr Kamat told reporters after coming out of the election office.

Ruling BJP has fielded Sharmad Pai Raiturcar from Margao, the commercial hub of Goa located some 35km from Panaji.

The former Chief Minister had been representing this Assembly segment since 1994 - first on BJP ticket (till 2005) and later as the Congress MLA. He was the Congress Chief Minister between 2007-2012.

The 62-year-old Congress leader said BJP, during its five-year rule, neglected Margao. ""My election plank would be development of the constituency,"" he said."

Chief Minister Harish Rawat, BJP leader Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri, Vijay Bahuguna among others are seeking party tickets for their family members for the february 15 state assembly polls.

The leaders are trying to get tickets for their children even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had exhorted people of the poll-bound states to shun dynastic politics and vote for development.

Interestingly, state Congress chief Kishore Upadhyay, who has a key role in the distribution of party tickets, faces a big test as he himself has been advocating to keep away from from dynastic politics.

The list of those lining up for tickets for their family, mostly sons or daughters, is huge.

Mr Rawat wants to field his two sons, Virendra and Anand, daughter Anupama and his wife Renuka, in this state elections.

According to sources from Congress, Virendra and Anand will be trying their luck from assembly segments in Kumaon region while Anupama and her mother could contest from Haridwar district, a Garhwal division of the state.

Going by the reports, Mr Rawat himself might contest from two assembly seats.

His other relatives, Karan Mehra, Rajya Sabha MP Mahendra Singh Mehra are also aspiring for party tickets.

Apart from them, Mr Rawat's loyalists, including Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal, former MLA from Sult Ranjit Singh Rawat, Lalit Farsvaan from Kapkot, Harish Dhami from Dharchula and Almonda's Manoj Tiwari are vying for ticket to be party's candidate.

State finance minister Indira Hridayesh and Irrigation minister Yashpal Arya also want to field their sons in the elections.

BJP, which claims it is against dynastic politics, is eyeing on Ritu Bhushan, daughter of former chief minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri, to contest from Karnaprayag. Vijay Bahuguna apparently have also asked ticket for his son Saket or Sourav to take on the electoral battle from Sitarganj seat.

BJP's Satpal Maharaj has projected himself from Chaubattakhal while his wife and former forest minister Amrita Rawat has sought ticket from Ramnagar assembly seat."

The party however withheld the announcement for six others, where it has sitting MLAs, indicating that some of them could be dropped. Union Minister J P Nadda, who is also party's Central Election Committee (CEC) Secretary, told reporters that the names of remaining candidates would be announced later. Five sitting MLAs are among the 17 candidates announced today. BJP has 12 MLAs in the outgoing Assembly.

These six seats include four being represented by ministers in the SAD-BJP coalition government. A couple of them could be dropped as they are over 75 years of age and some others are being seen more vulnerable in an election where the alliance is weathering 10 years of anti-incumbency.

It also fielded Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina for the bypoll to Amritsar Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant following the resignation of Congress leader Amarinder Singh, who had defeated Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2014 polls. Rajesh Hani will contest from Amritsar East, a seat held by Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who along with her husband Navjot Singh Sidhu has quit BJP. She has joined Congress.

The five MLAs in today's list are Dinesh Singh Babbu, Seema Kumari, Ashwani Sharma, K D Bhandari and Sukhjeet Kaur Sahi from Sujanpur, Bhoa, Pathankot, Jalandhar North and Dasuya constituencies respectively.

BJP's National Secretary Tarun Chugh will fight from Amritsar Central.

Some MLAs, who are likely to be dropped, are pitching for family members as party candidates.

The CEC, which included Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah, had met last evening to finalise the names. Sources said there are divergent views in the party over dropping some of the MLAs, causing a delay in the final announcement.

The notification for the state polls, to be held on February 4, was made yesterday and the last date of filing nomination is January 18.

SAD-BJP is locked in a tough battle with Congress and AAP, which has emerged as a formidable third force in the state."

Mr Sampla, who is a union minister, had met BJP chief Amit Shah this morning, amid reports that he was upset at a candidate he wanted not being picked by the party's central selection committee. Punjab will vote for a new government on February 4. The BJP partners the Akali Dal in the ruling alliance.  

""I met the president on a different issue. We are very active in our mission...Neither I nor our president is unhappy,"" Mr Sampla said, who trended on Twitter after meeting Mr Shah.

The minister emphasised that the selection of candidates was a collective decision and ""involves everybody's will."" The list of BJP candidates for Punjab had his full support, he said. The BJP will contest 23 of Punjab's 117 seats, while the Akali Dal will contest 94.

In a strong letter, citing a recent judgement of the Supreme Court, the EC said peace and tranquility during the polls process is ""absolutely essential for free and peaceful conduct of elections in the country.""

""As you are kindly aware the model code of conduct and various provisions of IPC, inter alia, provide that political parties and their leaders should desist from making statements to the effect of creating disharmony between different sections of society on the basis of religion as the same disturb peace and tranquility of the society which is absolutely essential for free and peaceful conduct of elections.

""Even, the apex court of the country has expressed its deep concerns in the matter vide its judgement and order dated January 2, 2017...,"" it said.

The EC's letter to the national and state parties added: ""The Commission will not remain a silent spectator if the provisions of law or MCC are violated and no one can do it with impunity. The Commission will take stern actions for any violation under all powers available.""

""All may please note it and issue suitable advisory to all concerned,"" it added.

In a landmark verdict seeking to separate religion, caste and other issues from politics, the Supreme Court, by a majority verdict, had held as ""corrupt"" the practice of candidates appealing for votes on the basis of these identities included not only him but his agents and voters.

The court held that the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, which say that seeking vote by a candidate in the name of ""his"" religion, caste, race and language in the election law, included candidates, his agents and voters also.

""An appeal in the name of religion, race, caste, community or language is impermissible under the R P Act, 1951 and would constitute a corrupt practice sufficient to annul the election in which such an appeal was made regardless whether the appeal was in the name of the candidate's religion or the religion of the election agent or that of the opponent or that of the voter's,"" the top court order had said.

Between February 4 and March 8, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur are going for Assembly polls and the Model Code of Conduct came into force on January 4 when the EC announced the election schedule."
"'Will Contest Election,' Says Shivpal Yadav, Isolated After Nephew Akhilesh Yadav's Big Win","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/will-contest-election-says-shivpal-yadav-isolated-after-nephew-akhilesh-yadavs-big-win-1650134","Lucknow: HighlightsMr Yadav's name added to list sent by brother Mulayam to nephew Akhilesh
Meeting being held at Akhilesh Yadav's office to finalise SP candidates
SP will contest UP election in partnership with Congress
                                Shivpal Yadav, recently deposed as the Samajwadi Party's Uttar Pradesh chief in a bitter power tussle with his nephew and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, has said he will contest next month's assembly elections in the state.

""I will fight the elections,"" Shivpal Yadav told NDTV this morning. The 61-year-old politician's name was added last night to a list of 38 candidates sent by older brother Mulayam Singh to Akhilesh Yadav, who has been recognised by the Election Commission as the Samajwadi Party's chief and has been allotted use of its cycle symbol.

A meeting is being held today at Akhilesh Yadav's 5 Kalidas Marg office in Lucknow to finalise the Samajwadi Party's candidates for UP. It will contest the election in partnership with the Congress, and has offered a little over a 100 of UP's 403 seats for the ally and any others who join them.

Akhilesh Yadav's party will contest about 300 seats and, sources said, the Chief Minister is expected to accommodate all the 38 people recommended by his father; many of the names, they said, overlap with the son's nominees for those seats.

For months, Shivpal Yadav undermined and challenged the Chief Minister's decisions in a family feud that saw Mulayam Singh consistently back his brother against son Akhilesh.  

It resulted in Akhilesh Yadav, 43, overthrowing father and uncle at a party meeting earlier this month, after they released a list of candidates without consulting him. He also challenged them for use of the party name and symbol; the Election Commission said the Chief Minister has proved that he and not his father has the majority support in the Samajwadi Party.

While Akhilesh Yadav has rushed to mend fences with his father, the Election Commission's order has left Shivpal Yadav isolated. Mulayam Singh indicated on Tuesday that he will not launch a new party if his son accommodates his candidates for the UP elections.

In the list of 38 names that he sent to Akhilesh Yadav, Shivpal Yadav's name was initially missing. Mulayam Singh later revised the list, scratching out the name of Shivpal's son Aditya Yadav, to add his for the Jaswantnagar constituency that he represents."
"Race Among Relatives As BJP Picks Candidates For UP. 50 In Queue","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/race-among-leaders-relatives-as-bjp-picks-candidates-for-up-50-in-queue-1649289","New Delhi:                             Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's firm no to family members of party men contesting polls, the BJP has been swamped with requests on behalf of relatives and some may even slip into the final list, say sources. 

Some four dozen BJP leaders have requested that their relatives be given a chance to contest in Uttar Pradesh, where polls will be held on five days in February and March.

At least 50 sons, daughters and relatives are said to be in the queue, undeterred by PM Modi's strong views. He has often attacked the Samajwadi Party as a ""baap-beta"" or father-son party.

The party is set to announce its first list of 140-odd candidates for the first day of polling on February 4 after a meeting of its Central Election Committee headed by president Amit Shah yesterday. The list is expected to be an indicator of the caste and community spin the BJP will drive in the coming polls.

In the previous polls held in the state - the 2014 national election - the BJP's spectacular haul of 71 of 80 seats was partly credited to the polarization of votes after the riots in Muzaffarnagar.

This time, PM Modi's pro-development pitch will be the main consideration while choosing candidates, the BJP says.

 Party leaders are upbeat about their chances, despite fighting without a chief ministerial candidate and despite facing a tough fight from Mayawati's BSP and even a divided Samajwadi Party.

''The surgical strike and the demonetisation exercise have pushed the PM as the best vote-getter and the public is responding enthusiastically - so much so the party may go past the half-way mark,"" said a UP BJP core committee member.

Expectations of a victory has translated into a race for tickets among the relatives of senior party functionaries.

Home Minister Rajnath singh's son Pankaj tops the list of such aspirants; he reportedly wants to contest from Noida or Sahibabad in Ghaziabad district. Rajnath singh had won the Ghaziabad seat in 2009.

Union Minister Kalraj Mishra's son Amit Mishra has dropped hints that he expects a ticket. His followers have bombarded parts of Lucknow, especially around the BJP state headquarters, with his posters.

Another Lucknow bigwig, Lalji Tandon, was refused the Governor's job in 2014, but his son Ashutosh hopes to make it to an assembly seat.

The BJP's newest members are also not far behind in expecting tickets to contest.

Ex-Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi and former leader of the BSP or Bahujan Samaj Party, Swami Prasad Maurya, are reportedly campaigning for tickets for their relatives. Ms Joshi is said to be trying for her son Mayank's nomination while Mr Maurya reportedly wants son Utkarsha and daughter Sanghmitra both to contest.

Another ex-BSP leader now with BJP, Brajesh Pathak, wants a ticket for his son from Unnao near Kanpur.

Hukum Singh, the controversial BJP lawmaker from Kairana who raised a storm with his claims that Hindus were migrating from the area, wants a ticket for his daughter Mrigyanka Singh.

Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh's son Rajveer Singh, a parliamentarian from Etah, wants his son or wife to reach the state assembly and he is said to be negotiating a deal through his father for at least one ticket in Bulandshahr in western UP.

Devendra Bhole, BJP's sitting MP from Kanpur Dehat, wants a ticket for his son.

Keshav Prasad Maurya has his task cut out. He needs the support of all sitting MPs and leaders during the campaign and can't afford to displease any of them.

The list is long - Moradabad MP Sarvesh Singh, sources say, wants a ticket for his son Sudhansu or wife Sadhna.

BP Mishra, the lawmaker from Banda, is asking for a ticket for nephew Prakash from Karvi, a BSP stronghold. Rekha Verma, the MP from Dhaurehra, reportedly wants a ticket for her niece.

Amroha MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar reportedly wants the Garhmukteshwar assembly seat for his son. Abhishek Pal, the son of Domariaganj MP Jagdambika Pal, is also an aspirant."

"90 Punjabis To Fly To India From Canada To Campaign For AAP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/90-punjabis-to-fly-to-india-from-canada-to-campaign-for-aap-1649099","Toronto:                             Some 90 Punjabis of Indian-origin from Canada will fly to Punjab to campaign for Aam Admi Party (AAP) in 16 of the state's largest constituencies for the assembly elections on February 4.

They will arrive in Punjab on January 19. ""I want to be a part of real change,"" Surinder Mavi, a 31-year-old Brampton resident who helped in organising the plane load of AAP ""election volunteers"" was quoted as saying by Toronto Star.

Mr Mavi said the Toronto area volunteers were part of a campaign that will see thousands of Indian expatriates arrive in Delhi in Punjab to help AAP in the elections, it reported.

Mr Mavi's political awakening began with his arrival in Canada eight years ago, when he realised bribes were unnecessary and basic rules, like stopping at red lights, were respected.

For the election, Mr Mavi will ride an AAP campaign bus that will rally support in 16 of Punjab's largest constituencies.

He had joined the Canadian branch of AAP, which had burst onto the Indian political scene two years ago with a platform of ending the culture of ""bribe-taking,"" the daily reported.

The key platform issues in campaign will be AAP's proposals to fight widespread drug abuse among the youth and programmes to give farmers more money for their crops.

Azad Kaushik, Canadian president of the Overseas Friends of BJP, admitted to ""an anti-incumbency factor"" in Punjab. But he told the Star over phone from Delhi, where he was visiting, that the BJP's economic record would keep its coalition with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in power in Punjab.

Mr Kaushik also accused AAP of having ""failed miserably"" in Delhi, which it governs. ""Polls in the last several months have indicated widely different results. But all show the AAP having a significant impact (in Punjab),"" it reported.

The Punjab election is likely to witness a three-way fight between SAD-BJP, Congress and AAP in all 117 seats."
"Ahead Of Punjab Elections, Navjot Singh Sidhu Joins Congress, Meets Rahul Gandhi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-joins-congress-ahead-of-punjab-elections-1648981","New Delhi: HighlightsNavjot Sidhu's wife said he would be contesting from Amritsar East seat
Election will be held in Punjab on February 4
Mr Sidhu had quit the BJP in September 2016
                                Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu joined the Congress today ahead of assembly elections in Punjab after yet another meeting with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, who welcomed him into the party. The 58-year-old had quit the BJP in September 2016, complaining that he had been sidelined.

Mr Sidhu came on board after lengthy negotiations and several rounds of meetings with Mr Gandhi. His wife Navjot Kaur said he would be contesting from the Amritsar East seat. Sources also said he would get one ticket per family for some of his supporters. As one of the party's star campaigner, he would also address more than 70 rallies.

It was, however, not clear that Mr Sidhu would be offered the post of the deputy Chief Minister, as he had earlier demanded.

Today' meeting with Rahul Gandhi -- the second in four days -- happened at mid-day, during which the Congress vice-president welcomed him into the party. Within minutes, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, ""INC welcomes S.Navjot Singh Sidhu & thanks Rahul Gandhiji for bringing likeminded leaders under the Congress umbrella"".

Later in the afternoon, Mr Sidhu tweeted:
Mr Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur has already been fielded as a candidate, but the constituency is yet to be decided.

Election will be held in Punjab on February 4, in which the Congress, which has been out of power for a decade, has been hoping for big gains. Captain Singh, who is leading the Congress campaign in the state and denied rumours about being unenthusiastic about having Mr Sidhu on board, today said he had spoken to the former cricketer on phone.   

Regarding Mr Sidhu's demand for the post of the deputy Chief Minister, Captain Amarinder Singh, the presumptive Chief Minister, said a decision will be taken by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Mr Gandhi at an ""appropriate time"".

The ruling Akali-BJP combine took potshots at the Congress and Mr Sidhu. Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal asked how he could join a party that ""attacked the Golden Temple"". He also took a dig at Amarinder Singh, tweeting:
Mr Sidhu, who quit the BJP two months ago, had that he had been forced to give up his Amritsar parliamentary seat by the party ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who had lost. Captain Amarinder Singh, who won, has vacated the seat to lead the Congress campaign in the state."
"Punjab Election 2017: Navjot Singh Sidhu And 40 Seats, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi To Decide","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-2017-navjot-singh-sidhu-and-40-seats-congress-vice-president-rahul-gandhi-to-decide-1647097","New Delhi: HighlightsCongress yet to announce candidates for Punjab election
Mr Sidhu wants 4 or 5 seats and also Amritsar parliament seat for himself
Mr Gandhi to hold meeting today to finalise candidates for Congress
                                With Rahul Gandhi back in town after a holiday abroad, the Punjab Congress hopes to wrap up selection of candidates - the party is yet to announce candidates for 40 of the state's 117 seats even a week after assembly elections were announced. Rivals Akali Dal-BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party are well off the mark and campaigning hard.

Mr Gandhi will head a meeting today to finalise candidates for the party, which released its manifesto for Punjab only yesterday. Nominations begin tomorrow and the state will vote on February 4.

The ever changing demands of cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, says sources, are part of the problem. Mr Sidhu, slated to join the Congress for weeks now, reportedly has new terms - he wants a seat to contest not only for himself, but also his wife, who has already joined the party, and other associates. Four or five seats is his latest demand, said sources, and he also wants the Amritsar parliament seat, which he once held as a BJP man, thrown in.   

That puts the Congress in a tight spot - it already has more than two strong claimants for most of the 40 assembly seats for which it is yet to announce candidates and faces rebellion from those who will be left out. In such a situation, five seats for the Sidhu team will be a stretch for the party.

The Congress' offer to Navjot Sidhu so far is the Amritsar East Assembly seat for him to contest and the Deputy Chief Minister's post if the party wins. Mr Sidhu had reportedly agreed to this, paring down an initial demand of 18 seats, but now wants some more.

The Sidhu camp says the current Congress offer barely matches the Aam Aadmi Party offer that he spurned. Arvind Kejriwal's party too had offered to project Mr Sidhu as deputy Chief Minister, like the Congress refusing to field him as presumptive Chief Minister.

Navjot Singh Sidhu quit the BJP last year and has been negotiating with rivals AAP and the Congress since July to setttle on his next political destination."
"No Ads Featuring PM Narendra Modi, Chief Ministers In Polling States: Election Commission","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-ads-featuring-pm-narendra-modi-chief-ministers-in-polling-states-election-commission-1647174","New Delhi:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi's images may soon have to be covered or removed at petrol pumps in the five states where elections will be held from February 4.

The Election Commission has ordered that hoardings and photos of PM Modi, Chief Ministers and other political leaders be removed ahead of polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur.

Ads that use public money to project the achievements of political functionaries or political parties are a violation of the model code of conduct, the powerful election body said today.

Instructions have gone to top election officers in the states ""that the photo of political leaders in all hoardings, advertisements that aim to project the achievements of any living political functionaries or political party should be removed or covered.""

The Congress had earlier urged the Election Commission to order the removal of PM Modi's photograph from government posters at public places, including petrol pumps, in the election-bound states. The party objected to the Prime Minister's photo in posters of oil companies put up to popularise a cooking gas scheme.The model code of conduct is in place in the five states, where elections will be held from February 4 to March 8. The votes will be counted on March 11.

In an earlier order, the Election Commission has asked candidates to furnish, if they put up hoardings at private properties, a No Objection Certificate from the owner. The cost of such posters or hoardings would be added to the candidate's expenditure list."
"Arvind Kejriwal To Launch 'Ghar Bachao Muhim' Campaign In Punjab","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-to-launch-ghar-bachao-muhim-campaign-in-punjab-1647381","Amritsar:                             AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal will be on a two-day visit to the Majha region of Punjab starting January 14 during which he will launch the 'Ghar Bachao Muhim' campaign in the run-up to the upcoming state Assembly polls.

Stating this in Amritsar today, AAP Punjab legal wing head and party candidate from Majitha Himmat Singh Shergill said the Delhi Chief Minister will launch the campaign to encourage the people of Majha to stand united against the ""corrupt"" politicians who ""ruined"" numerous young lives by ""patronising the drug trade"" in the state.

Mr Shergill, who was accompanied by AAP candidate from Amritsar (South) Inderbir Singh Nijjer, said Kejriwal will be in the region from January 14 to 15 during which he will tour the villages of Bhoa, Dinanagar, Dera Baba Nanak, Ajnala, Rajasansi, Attari, Tarn Taran and Khemkaran constituencies falling in the border zone.

He will give a clarion call to the people to fight a ""decisive"" battle against the ""crooked"" politicians for their legitimate rights and betterment of future generations.

Mr Shergill said it was pathetic that Punjabis, who immensely contributed to the national food basket, despite their small geographical area, formed the majority in the army and brought laurels in education and sports, were feeling ""depressed and deserted"" by these ""so-called leaders"" who were busy ""filling their coffers at the cost of Punjab's future"".

Mr Nijjer said Punjabis have always been on the forefront in defending the nation and were acclaimed throughout the world for their exemplary courage, honesty and hard work, but the ""wicked"" politicians have ""wreaked havoc"" on the younger generation by ""exposing them to lethal drugs"".

He asserted that AAP had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" towards drugs and corruption and that those involved in these will be dealt with sternly if the party came to power in Punjab."
"Akhilesh Yadav Has Forged A New Force In Indian Politics","http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/akhilesh-yadav-has-set-a-new-paradigm-for-ups-politics-1647161","Taking a longer view of developments in the Samajwadi Party, it can safely be said that it is immaterial who wins the ""cycle race"", that is, which faction is allotted the bicycle symbol. In fact, so convoluted is the scenario that it is not even certain that there are two clear factions, and it is equally uncertain if the party will split at all. Matters took a comic turn last Monday when the contending groups led by father and son respectively approached the Election Commission with reams of documents to prove their majority within the party and thereby claim their right to the symbol. But by late evening, it was clear that the patriarch, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was keen to pull back from the brink and even the so far belligerent son, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, was not averse to yet another formula to broker peace. ""The Samajwadi Party stands united"" muttered Mulayam Singh while declaring that Akhilesh Yadav would remain the party's electoral face and Chief Ministerial candidate. So many U-turns have been made in the last one month that nothing can be concluded with finality.

But one thing is certain: the SP has already split within, even if it pretends to stay united for public consumption for the time being. It is often assumed that the SP parivaar is basically a drama within the extended Mulayam Singh family, that rival contenders are trying to push one another out in order to take full control over the organization on the eve of the Assembly elections scheduled to be held within the next couple of months. The informal split which has already happened is discernibly one between two generations, with patriarch Mulayam Singh leading the elder and more established leaders (mostly his own relatives), while Akhilesh heads the younger group comprising mostly non-family leaders.

For observers of Indian politics, this is a fascinating scenario. What is playing out is a dramatic generational transition in India's biggest once-Mandalite party. Although Mulayam Singh, along with Lalu Prasad in Bihar, was among the biggest beneficiaries of Mandalism in Indian politics and also an architect of the electorally invincible M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) formula, time has taken a toll on their grasp of Hindi heartland politics. The M-Y alliance helped to thwart the challenge of BJP's mobilization in the name of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Despite the euphoria which brought Kalyan Singh to power in 1991, he could not repeat that performance for the BJP post demolition of the Babri Masjid, and Mulayam was back in the saddle.

Since the 1990s, UP's politics has remained clearly delineated. Over time, the Congress steadily eroded as a mass party, while Mayawati's fledging BSP with its core Dalit support base emerged as a serious contender for power, initially in alliance with the BJP, but eventually on its own steam. Through this, Mulayam Singh's M-Y base was largely undiminished. However the ageing patriarch failed to read the aspirational urges of his own Yadav and remaining OBC communities. Maybe finally recognising the need to make a generational switch, he fielded his son Akhilesh as the party's Chief Ministerial face in 2012 and the energetic new generation leader surprised pundits by leading the SP to a spectacular victory, winning 229 seats in the 405-member UP Assembly in that election.

Akhliesh Yadav dramatically altered his father's style of politics, focusing almost entirely on UP's economic development aimed at consolidating a youth support base that largely cut across caste and community lines. After five years, people in UP recall world-class highways (such as the 393-km-long Agra-Lucknow Expressway built in a record time of 22 months), the recently launched Lucknow-Ballia Expressway, and the Lucknow metro as the dominant symbols of Akhilesh's rule. There is hardly anything by way of infrastructure built by his predecessors that can compare with the breakneck speed with which Akhilesh went about modernizing UP. This was accompanied by a plethora of social sector schemes targeting women and farmers. While such social schemes often flounder on delivery and lead to corruption too, so far the UP Government has managed to implement them with a fair measure of success. The noticeable aspect of Akhilesh's record in office is that no appeal has been made on caste and community lines: He has played primarily on the aspirational urges of the youth, particularly the newly empowered Yadav and OBC youth.

This approach has brought him into conflict with the older generation Yadav leadership in his own party, particularly his uncle Shivpal, who is alleged to operate through a network of local strongmen. Akhilesh may have thus failed to get on top of UP's law and order situation, but few doubt his sincerity to eventually combat such elements.

Thus the division within the Samajwdi Party is not just generational, it is also aspirational. In this the young Samajwadi leader is fighting not only against his own family, most of which is tied to traditional clan-based politics, but is also contesting against the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi whose policies attract the youth across caste and class.

In many senses, therefore, Akhilesh Yadav is the first mature post-Mandal leader in contemporary politics. Clearly the politics of pure Mandalism has run its course - for the empowerment of the OBCs is now an irreversible reality. Akhilesh is working to construct a post-Mandal base for himself and his party and may well become the example for other similar outfits in North India.

With or without the bicycle symbol and irrespective of whether he leads a united SP to the hustings, Akhilesh Yadav has emerged as UP's pre-eminent next generation politician. Even if he fails to repeat his winning feat of 2012 in the forthcoming Assembly poll, the constituency he is carving out for himself is there to stay. Mayawati's Dalit-dominated party is unlikely to ever gain cross-caste acceptability, although a section of Muslims may vote for her as a tactical ploy to defeat the BJP. In fact, it can be said with some certainty that a paradigm shift has come over UP politics and development has pushed identity politics to the back-burner, even if it takes decades to extinguish it altogether.

And that paradigm shift heralded by Akhilesh Yadav is spelling the doom for backroom cloak-and-dagger politics at which Mulayam Singh's associates excel. Politicians are a canny lot at the worst of times, and so the overwhelming support garnered by Akhilesh within his own party, to the chagrin of leaders like Shivpal Singh, clearly shows which way the wind is blowing. Split or no split, the Samajwadi Party is Akhilesh's for the taking.

"Mulayam Singh And Akhilesh Yadav Meet For 90 Minutes, Fail To Agree","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mulayam-singh-and-akhilesh-yadav-meet-for-90-minutes-fail-to-agree-1647318","Lucknow:                             Warring father-son Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav ended yet another long meeting in Lucknow today without finding common ground. The one-on-one meeting came after Mulayam Singh Yadav seemed to initiate a reconciliation by saying last evening that Akhilesh would be Chief Minister again if the Samajwadi Party wins the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, to be held in multiple phases starting February 11.

The deal-breaker is the position of party president, usurped from his father by Akhilesh Yadav at a party meeting on January 1. Mulayam Singh Yadav asserts he is still party president and wants Akhilesh to give up his claim. Akhilesh, who is backed by a majority leaders and lawmakers in the party, is adamant that he will hold the post for three months and will relinquish it once the UP elections are finished.

Bihar politician Lalu Yadav confirmed that Akhilesh had told him as much when they talked on phone last evening.

The 43-year-old Chief Minister deeply mistrusts his father's closest aides, Mulayam Singh's younger brother Shivpal Yadav and Amar Singh, and wants them kept away from crucial decision-making in this period. His demands - that Shivpal Yadav be removed as the party's UP chief and Amar Singh be sacked - have not been agreed to by Mulayam Singh.      

""Akhilesh will be the Chief Minister after the election, there is no confusion about it,"" said Mulayam Singh on Monday, seen as a significant climbdown. He had earlier said that only he will decide who will be the Chief Minister if the Samajwadi Party is re-elected in UP.

In the power struggle perilously close to the elections, while Akhilesh Yadav has accused Shivpal Yadav and Amar Singh of instigating Mulayam Singh against him, his father's camp has targeted his uncle and staunch supporter Ram Gopal Yadav, accusing him of misguiding Akhilesh.

Ram Gopal has spearheaded Akhilesh's solo campaign, calling the party meeting in which he was declared Samajwadi Party president and also carrying to the Election Commission six boxes of documents to prove that Akhilesh commands the loyalty of a majority in the party and so is the real leader of the Samajwadi Party and must be assigned the party's ""cycle"" symbol to contest the UP elections.

As Mulayam Singh, who too met the Election Commission to stake claim to the party symbol on Monday, declared that there was ""no rift"" with his son, Ram Gopal urged the poll panel to take a quick decision on which faction would get the ""cycle,"" indicating that Team Akhilesh is no mood to bend."

"Congress Beats Akhilesh Yadav To It, Announces Uttar Pradesh Alliance","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadavs-wingman-rahul-gandhi-announcement-likely-tomorrow-1649603","Lucknow: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav says Congress alliance to be announced in ""a day or two""
Akhilesh, Rahul Gandhi expected to hold rallies together in campaign
Akhilesh Yadav yesterday won rights to use party name, symbol
                                Akhilesh Yadav, having set aside his family drama, is moving on to the next order of business ahead of the election: stapling together the alliance that he believes will help him counter rivals Mayawati and the BJP in Uttar Pradesh which begins voting next month. A deal with the Congress will be announced ""in a day or two,"" he told NDTV today. The Congress pre-empted him, declaring the collaboration at a press conference in Delhi today, though it said the details are being finalized. Key among those: how many of the state's 403 seats will be allotted to the Congress and to another potential partner, Ajit Singh's RLD.

Mr Yadav, 43, wants another term as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, but has been preoccupied with a confrontation with his father, Mulayam Singh, whose power play included declaring candidates for the election without inputs from his son.

Yesterday, the issue of who is boss was decided by the Election Commission which ruled that Akhilesh Yadav has the backing of most of the Samajwadi Party and is therefore in control of the legit version of the outfit and not a spin-off as his father had alleged. The victory entitles the young politician to the use of the party symbol of the cycle, easily recognized by voters. Determined to maintain his line of maximum respect for his father, Mr Yadav went to visit him as soon as the case was decided in his favour and then tweeted a photo of them together.

He confirmed today that he is closing a deal with the Congress, which could expand to include smaller regional parties like Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal or RLD. Rahul Gandhi, who is the Vice President of the Congress, has an established political bromance with Akhilesh Yadav. Recently, they flexed their amity if not their vocabulary, with Mr Gandhi terming Mr Yadav ""a good boy"" who shot off the same phrase in return.
 
Mr Yadav had pushed unsuccessfully for his father to agree to a tie-up with the Congress, offering the claim that a partnership could help them get about 300 of the state's 403 seats, largely by consolidating the significant Muslim vote. The alliance is expected to allot about 75-80 seats for Congress candidates. Sources say that Mr Gandhi and Mr Yadav will address rallies together; ditto for Mr Yadav's wife, Dimple, who is a parliamentarian, and Mr Gandhi's sister, Priyanka.

""In our area, in each election, the Congress candidate does manage to get about 5,000 to 10,000 votes, so if both parties were to form an alliance, it would definitely transfer those votes to us and vice versa,"" said Shakeel Ahemd Qureshi, a 66-year-old Samajwadi Party worker from Western Uttar Pradesh.

For the Congress, whose lack of firepower in Uttar Pradesh has been embarrassingly visible, riding piggyback with Mr Yadav offers a chance at some sort of political rejuvenation. As soon as Mr Yadav was declared in custody of the Samjawadi Party yesterday, enthused Congress workers put up posters that were giddy with delight over the alliance that is to follow.

In the alliance that Akhilesh Yadav plans, the Samajwadi Party is likely to contest about 300 of UP's 403 assembly seats, while the Congress could contest about 75, and the RLD and other parties could contest 25-30. It follows the Bihar experiment, where Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was re-elected after strategically partnering with old rival Lalu Yadav's RJD and the Congress.

Elections in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases starting February 11. Votes will be counted on March 11."
"Uttarakhand Polls: Resentment Among BJP Leaders Over Ticket Distribution","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-polls-resentment-among-bjp-leaders-over-ticket-distribution-1649927","Dehradun:                             With nearly all Congress turncoats fielded by the BJP for the February 15 Uttarakhand Assembly polls, resentment prevails among a section of trusted party leaders who have been denied tickets to make room for candidates imported from outside. There are at least 20 seats where strong ticket contenders have been disappointed giving rise to the possibility that some of them may enter the fray as independents or work to spoil the prospects of the party's official nominees.

While most of the disappointed contenders are yet to disclose their cards, they make no bones about their feeling of being left out.

With Congress turncoat Subodh Uniyal fielded from Narendranagar, BJP's very own Om Gopal Rawat, a former MLA who had consistently nursed the constituency has announced his intention to contest as an independent from the seat.

There is discontent among party leaders in almost all seats from where Congress rebels have been fielded. Former legislator Asha Nautiyal who was expecting a ticket from Kedarnath is unhappy with Congress turncoat Shailarani Rawat fielded from the seat.

Similarly, former MLA Shailendra Singh Rawat is disappointed over Harak Singh Rawat being fielded from Kotdwar.

Former MLA Suresh Chand Jain is sulking in Roorkee from where Pradip Batra has been declared the party's official nominee.

Jain said he feels cheated and will certainly contest for development of the town.

Some of the party's sitting MLAs have also been denied tickets including Yamkeshwar MLA Vijaya Barthwal and Chaubatakhal MLA and former Pradesh BJP president Tirath Singh Rawat.

While Barthwal has been denied a ticket to field former CM and Pauri MP BC Khanduri's daughter Ritu Khanduri, Tirath was ignored to make room for Congress turncoat Amrita Rawat's husband Satpal Maharaj.

Resentment among BJP leaders ahead of assembly polls doesn't augur well for the party with Congress in a mood to lap up disgruntled BJP elements and field them against erstwhile party rebels."

The man who threw the shoe is the brother of a Sikh radical leader, police said.

40-year-old Gurbachan Singh threw the shoe towards Mr Badal, which first hit security personnel and then touched 89-year-old Mr Badal's turban, police said.

""A man identified as Gurbachan Singh, a relative of a Sikh radical leader, threw a shoe at Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal,"" Muktsar Senior Superintendent of Police Dhruman H Nimbale said. There was no injury to Mr Badal in this incident, he added.

The police officer said the incident occurred at village Ratta Khera where Mr Badal was busy in a public meeting during his election campaign.

Gurbachan Singh is the brother of radical Sikh leader Amrik Singh Ajnala.

""He appeared to be upset over the sacrilege incidents which took place in Punjab,"" the Senior Superintendent of Police said, adding that he had been arrested.

A case will be registered against the accused, he said.

A few days ago, a group of people threw stones at the cavalcade of deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal at Kandhwala Hazir Khan village in his constituency, Jalalabad in Fazilka district, leaving four Akali supporters injured.

"After Rahul Gandhi's 'Hand' Remark, BJP Guns For Congress Poll Symbol","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/after-rahul-gandhis-hand-remark-bjp-guns-for-congress-poll-symbol-1648784","Lucknow: HighlightsRahul Gandhi violated mode code of conduct, alleges BJP 
Mr Gandhi allegedly correlated the Congress symbol with religious figures
The BJP has sought the withdrawal of the Congress' election symbol
                                The BJP has alleged that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi violated the model code of conduct by ""co-relating the Congress election symbol with religious figures"". The party has filed a complaint with the Chief Electoral Officer of Uttar Pradesh, where elections will take place next month, against the Congress leader. The BJP has also sought the withdrawal of the Congress' election symbol 'hand' and also cancellation of its recognition as a national party.

""Rahul Gandhi, at a convention, named as 'Jan Vedna Sammelan' in Delhi on January 11, 2017, made religious comments by co-relating the symbol of Indian National Congress with religious gods such as Shivji, Guru Nanak, Buddha, Mahavir and Islam, violating the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, MCC and the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court,"" the BJP wrote in its complaint on Friday.

Mr Gandhi had said: ""I found Congress symbol in Shivji, Guru Nanak, Buddha, Mahavir's pictures. I asked Karan Singhji what does it mean? He said (it means) 'don't get afraid.'""

""It's a blatant violation of the model code of conduct and strict action should be taken against Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party for trying to influence voters not only in Uttar Pradesh but also in other poll-bound states, ""said senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav.

Rejecting the allegation, Congress leader PL Punia said, ""What Rahul (Gandhi) said was just a statement to highlight the high recall value and the emotional bond with the Congress symbol. What is so objectionable about that? ""

Demanding the cancellation of the Congress' recognition as a national party, the BJP letter said, ""The Congress party has not disassociated itself from the statements of Shri Rahul Gandhi. Therefore, it has also further violated the Model Code of Conduct.""

"Goa Polls: BJP Announces Names Of Candidates For 29 Seats","http://www.ndtv.com/goa-news/goa-polls-bjp-announces-names-of-candidates-for-29-seats-1648107","New Delhi:                             Refraining from projecting Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar as its chief ministerial candidate in the Goa Assembly polls, BJP today announced the names of candidates for 29 seats, including 17 sitting MLAs.

Mr Parsekar figures in the list released by the party in New Delhi today following its Central Election Committee's meeting last evening.

One sitting MLA, Deputy Speaker Vishnu Surya Wagh, who had last year suffered cardiac arrest, has not been fielded on health grounds and is replaced by Ramrao Surya Wagh.

Defence Minister and former Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar will be the key election campaigner for the party in a state where Congress, an alliance of regional outfits, including one headed by a former senior RSS leader, and AAP are other players in the fray.

Mr Parsekar, a Parrikar loyalist, had taken over from him after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inducted him in his Cabinet as Defence Minister. He, however, continues to have a say in the state's affairs.

Releasing the list, J P Nadda, who is CEC secretary, said the party has given representation to all communities and added that it is considering putting up candidates for all the 40 seats.

The last date of filing nomination, which began yesterday, is January 18.

Asked about its chief ministerial candidate, he said any decision in this regard will be taken by the Parliamentary Board.

He also released the list of three party candidates for biennial election to UP Legislative Council."
"Uttar Pradesh Now Has 14.12 Crore Voters","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-now-has-14-12-crore-voters-1648511","Lucknow:                             With the Election Commission publishing the revised and final voters list for the state, Uttar Pradesh now has a whopping 14.12 crore voters, who are eligible to exercise their franchise in the forthcoming State Assembly polls beginning February 11.

The state now has 7.68 crore men, 6.44 crore women and 7,272 transgenders who have their names registered in the voters list, an official said on Friday. This number is 27 lakh more that the previously recorded number of 13.85 crore.

During the drive to increase the number of voters through various programmes, the poll panel has successfully been able to muster the support of first-time voters, whose number has sharply increased.

In all, 32.36 lakh names were removed from the voters list -- 14.99 lakh had been removed from the voter list for shifting to other states and 5.53 lakh names were struck off the voters list for being registered at two places, an official told IANS. 

The percentage share of women voters has increased from 58.78 per cent to 60.38 per cent while the gender ratio has increased from 827 to 839.

The population share of registered voters has also increased from 60 to 63 per cent. UP will vote to elect 403 lawmakers in a seven-phase poll beginning February 11 and ending on March 8.

"Congress Manifesto Offers To End VIP Culture In Punjab","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congress-manifesto-offers-to-end-vip-culture-in-punjab-1646968","New Delhi/Chandigarh:                             The Congress manifesto for the Punjab assembly elections was released today by former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh in New Delhi. The manifesto was released simultaneously in six other cities of the state.

"Navjot Sidhu For Congress? Not Quite Yet. 'Stars Do Matter,' Says Wife","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-for-congress-not-quite-yet-astrology-and-clarity-sought-1648454","Amritsar: HighlightsNavjot Singh Sidhu met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi yesterday
Mr Sidhu's wife says he will join unconditionally, but needs clarity
""The stars do matter, waiting for right time"": Sidhu's wife
                                A day after Rahul Gandhi met Navjot Singh Sidhu, the cricket commentator's wife, who is also a politician, has said that the couple ""wants clarity"" on what they are being offered before Mr Sidhu formally joins the Congress. In what seems contradictory to that stand, she then went on to say, ""Our joining the Congress is unconditional.""

The 53-year-old former cricketer quit the BJP in September 2016, after alleging that he had been sidelined by the party, which had forced him to surrender his parliamentary seat of Amritsar for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who lost the constituency in 2014. Two months later, his wife, Navjyot Kaur Sidhu, joined the Congress. Negotiations for how and when Navjot Singh will come on board have been long-running.   

""Yes, we believe a lot in astrology, he will be particular about on what date he joins. Stars do affect you,"" said Navjot Kaur, who in an earlier interview, said her husband and she are ""the same soul n two bodies.""
 Asked about when Navjot Sidhu will join Congress, Mrs Sidhu said, we ""want clarity"" on what's offered
Punjab votes on February 4. The Congress campaign, with Captain Amarinder Singh as presumptive Chief Minister, is in full swing. So is that of Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party, and that of the Badals, who head the incumbent government with the BJP.

Navjot Kaur said today that either her husband or she will run for the Punjab assembly, but it is believed that Mr Sidhu has demanded four to five assembly seats for his associates including his wife, besides the Amritsar parliamentary seat, vacated by Captain Singh.

The Congress is also contending with Mr Siddhu's reported claim for the office of Deputy Chief Minister in case of a Congress victory; Captain Singh has refused to commit to that, stating that a decision would be taken by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Mr Gandhi at an ""appropriate time"".

""We want a clear role in Punjab, we don't want the same insecure relations with Amarinder Singh as had with the Akalis,"" she said, referring to the couple's acrimonious split from their earlier political partners."
"2 Heavyweights, A Small Town - The Biggest Electoral Battle In Punjab","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2-heavyweights-one-small-town-the-biggest-electoral-battle-in-punjab-1648339","Jalalabad, Punjab:                             It is the battle of the heavyweights, the blue ribbon event of the Punjab Assembly Elections. Of the 117 seats, Punjab's biggest electoral battle will be in Jalalabad, a small border town near 300 km from state capital Chandigarh.

No other seat has two opposing stalwarts of this stature. On the one hand there is Sukhbir Badal, the sitting legislator and Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab, on the other, a man who is AAP's star campaigner.

Mr Badal is better known as the son of the five-time Chief Minister of Punjab, Parkash Singh Badal. His challenger is comedian, musician and actor-turned-politician Bhagwant Mann.

Mr Mann showed people don't just come to his rallies for a laugh, when he won the Parliamentary seat from Sangrur in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He is second only to AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal when it comes to crowd pulling.
 
The initial delay in declaring Mr Badal as the Akali candidate triggered suggestions that he wasn't going to take on Mr Mann. As he reached Jalalabad to file his nomination today, he was shown black flags by the local bar association.

The sitting Parliamentarian Sher Singh Ghubaya of the Akali Dal did not accompany him. A few days ago, stones were pelted on Mr Badal's convoy in the area.

Yesterday, Mr Badal's wife, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, had suggested that if Parkash Singh Badal called for violence, AAP workers wouldn't survive. This was in the context of a shoe attack on the Chief Minister. The Akalis allege the man was connected to AAP.

Today, Sukhbir Badal reiterated what sounded like a warning and stopped short of an all-out threat.

""Our workers are quiet because we believe in law and order... this is all planned by AAP, including the incident with Parkash Badal. The previous incidents have been orchestrated by AAP and Bhagwant Mann has incited the violence,"" he said.

Addressing a few hundred people at a rally, Mr Mann retorted: ""The elder Badal says Bhagwant Mann is inciting people and is behind the shoe throwing attack and the pelting of stones on Sukhbir Badal. I am against these kind of acts. No place for them in democracy.''

Gurpreet Sandhu, spokesperson of a breakaway group from AAP, which calls itself APP (Apna Punjab Party) suggest they will be the key to this elections -- indicating a hung assembly could be the result.

Even they call Jalalabad the 'hot seat'.

The battle could get even more interesting because Sher Singh Ghubaya's son, who did not get a seat, has joined the Congress Mr Ghubaya commands great influence is the area as a Rai Sikh - a community that constitutes 35 per cent of the Jalalabad vote."
"UP Elections 2017: BJP Announces List Of 149 Candidates","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjp-announces-list-of-149-candidates-1649473","New Delhi:                             The BJP announced a list of 149 candidates for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, to be held in seven phases between February 11 and March 8. Most of the candidates announced today will contest the polls in the first two phases on February 11 and 15. The party's Central Election Committee met last night to finalise the candidates. It will meet again, tomorrow, to discuss other prospective candidates for the polls.

Among the candidates released by the party, former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Vajpayee will seek to retain the Meerut constituency whereas Sandeep Singh, grandson of former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, will contest the poll in Atrauli. The party also announced its national secretary Shrikant Sharma as their candidate in Mathura.

The party has also retained incumbent legislators Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana, both accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots.

The list was released by Union Health Minister J P Nadda, who said that the party has accommodated various sections of the society.The list, interestingly, did not feature the name of Pankaj Singh - son of Union Home Minister and former Chief Minister Rajnath Singh - who is widely speculated to contest the UP polls.

According to news agency PTI, despite the entry of many state leaders from other parties into the BJP, former BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya is unhappy with the leadership over the choice of contestants.

The BJP has been out of power in the state of Uttar Pradesh since 2002. It seeks to regain power in the state, which gave them 71 seats in the 2014 Union elections.

"Manohar Parrikar For Goa Chief Minister Again? The BJP Doesn't Say No","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manohar-parrikar-for-goa-chief-minister-again-the-bjp-doesnt-say-no-1648649","Panaji: HighlightsManohar Parrikar remains the face of the party in Goa, says BJP
Goa goes into polls for a new government on February 4
Laxmikant Parsekar succeeded Manohar Parrikar as chief minister in 2014
                                The BJP does not rule out the return of Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar as Goa chief minister, with senior party sources saying today that all ""doors are open."" Mr Parrikar, they said, remains the face of the party, which he led to victory in the state in the last assembly elections. Goa will vote for a new government on February 4 and votes will be counted on March 11 along with four other states.

""Let us cross the bridge when it comes. (Nitin) Gadkariji has said what we wanted to say,"" said Mr Parrikar in capital Panaji today, on intense speculation after union minister Nitin Gadkari said yesterday that the next Goa chief minister ""can either be from the elected representatives or we can even send (someone) from the Centre,"" if the BJP retains the state.

Manohar Parrikar, 61, had been Chief Minister for a little over two years in his third stint in that post, when he was pulled out of Goa in late 2014 to join Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet as Defence Minister, replacing Arun Jaitley, who had held additional charge of the crucial ministry for several months.

In his state, Mr Parrikar remains the BJP's tallest leader and its most popular face. Laxmikant  Parsekar, who succeeded him as Chief Minister was handpicked by Mr Parrikar to take his place when he moved to Delhi. Mr Parrikar is often referred to as the ""super Chief Minister"" in Goa.

The Defence Minister has made frequent trips to Goa in recent weeks to campaign and plan the party's strategy and, sources said, he is expected to spend about 20 to 25 days off and on in the state till the elections.

By projecting Mr Parrikar, the BJP hopes to consolidate its voters in what is seen as a tough fight for the ruling party to retain a majority.

Regional party and ally Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP parted ways with the BJP last week. The MGP, which had contested the last Goa elections as a pre-poll partner of the BJP, has said it plans to field candidates in about 22 seats and is expected to cut into the BJP's votes.

Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party too is contesting the Goa elections for the first time this year and has named a former bureaucrat Elvis Gomes as its chief ministerial candidate. The Congress is yet to decide whether it will tie up with other parties or fight the Goa elections alone."

"MCD Election 2017: Congress, Twice Zero, Eyes AAP Voters in Delhi Civic Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/congress-twice-zero-eyes-aaps-urban-poor-voters-in-delhi-civic-polls-1682495","New Delhi:                             It has won zero seats in the last two elections held in Delhi, but the Congress is pinning its hopes on a fading out of the Aam Aadmi Party and annexing some of the massive vote share Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had won in the 2015 assembly elections to sweep the capital.

The Congress released the first part of its manifesto - there are three parts - for Delhi today targeting the urban poor who live in massive slums and unauthorised colonies across the capital and who gave Mr Kejriwal 60 per cent of his vote share two years ago.

""The upcoming Delhi civic body polls will be a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP. There is no third party in the contest,"" said Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken as he released the manifesto, calling Delhi's urban poor the most neglected segment in the capital. The Congress has promised that if it wins the three municipal corporations in Delhi, it will set aside 2,000 crores for the re-settlement of those who live in unauthorised colonies.

The party has also promised that Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD sanitation employees, currently on contract, will be given permanent jobs. And those 5 lakh street vendors will be given licences. The party also plans a scheme to bring drop-outs from MCD-run schools back into the education system.

In an important promise, the Congress has taken up complete elimination of land fill sites for better sanitation. The next two tranches of promises will focus on infrastructure and the youth.

The Congress has released its manifesto a day after the BJP did. The Aam Aadmi Party plans to release its manifesto tomorrow.

Elections to the MCD, now split into three - MCD North, MCD South and MCD East - will be held on Sunday, April 23, and votes will be counted on Wednesday, April 26. Delhi's civic body has been dominated by the BJP for 10 years now. In 2012, the first election after the MCD was divided into three, the BJP won a majority in the north and east and was the largest party in MCD south. The Congress had trailed in second place in all three. The Aam Aadmi Party did not contest that election - it was launched later that year.

While the BJP has pulled out all stops to retain control with a keenly devised strategy and high powered campaign, Arvind Kejriwal's AAP is seen as fighting to retain political relevance after being trounced in the Punjab and Goa elections this year.

The Congress' recent record in Delhi hasn't been great. In the assembly elections two years ago, AAP swept it aside winning 67 of 70 seats. The BJP won the other three. In the national election in 2014, the BJP took all seven Delhi seats in a Modi wave."
"MCD Elections 2017: Need VVPAT To Keep Tab On Civic Poll Results, AAP Tells Court","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/mcd-elections-2017-need-vvpat-to-keep-tab-on-civic-poll-results-aap-tells-court-1682736","New Delhi:                             The use of VVPAT or Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail machines should be allowed along with the Electronic Voting Machines during the upcoming civic polls in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party requested the Delhi High Court today. The appeal comes amid the huge controversy over the use of EVMs. Opposition parties, including AAP, contend that EVMS were tampered with in the recently held assembly elections and demand that the Election Commission reverts to the use of old-style ballot papers.

In absence of ballot papers, slips from VVPAT machines should be used to double check on the announced results, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has said.  This, he has said, is the easiest thing the Commission can do to win back people's faith.

AAP had already moved a request letter regarding this to the Election Commission. But in absence of a response even a week before elections, the party said it wants the court to intervene.

VVPAT machines dispense a paper slip that helps voters verify if their vote has been correctly recorded by the EVM.

The Election Commission, which has backed the EVMs through the controversy, has issued a challenge to non-believers to try and tamper with the machines. Mr Kejriwal, who has an engineering background, has said he can think of 10 ways in which the machines can be hacked.

The complaints against the EVMs started after a controversial demonstration of a machine Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district, which was allegedly used in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Pointing to the video demonstration by an election official, the opposition parties claimed it shows EVMs were tampered to favour the BJP.

The Election Commission had said the machine in question was an unused VVPAT machine that was kept in reserve during the elections in Uttar Pradesh. The Commission has also pointed out that the 45-day cooling off period necessary for an EVM is not essential for a VVPAT machine."
"By-Election Result 2017:  In Madhya Pradesh By-Polls, BJP And Congress Retain Seats They Held","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/by-election-result-2017-bjp-holds-fort-in-madhya-pradesh-wins-bandhavgarh-set-to-win-ater-1680969","Bhopal:                             The BJP and the Congress split Madhya Pradesh's two seats where by-elections were held, retaining seats they had held. The by-polls were watched closely as a bellwether for assembly elections next year.

In Bandhavgarh, the BJP's Shivnarayan Singh defeated the Congress candidate Savitri Singh by more than 25,476 votes. By-elections were held because the sitting BJP legislator was elected to parliament in a by-poll last year.

The by-poll in Ater has been won by the Congress' Hemant Katare, whose father Satyadev Katare was the Congress' legislator from the seat and had died recently. The party had fielded the MLA's son hoping to cash in on a sympathy wave, but Mr Katare almost didn't make it, trailing behind the BJP's Arvind Singh Bhadoria in the first few rounds and finally winning only by 857 votes.

The Congress had demanded that voting in the Madhya Pradesh by-elections be done on ballot paper and not electronic voting machines or EVMs, after a voting machine reportedly issued only BJP slips during a demonstration in Bhind, where the Ater constituency is. The Election Commission has emphatically said that EVMs cannot be rigged, rejecting the demand for paper ballot.

The last-minute win in Madhya Pradesh improved the Congress' tally from today's by-elections. For most of the day it had seemed set to retain only two seats in Karnataka. The party has lost state after state in assembly elections since its debacle in the 2014 national elections and hopes to benefit from a possible anti-incumbency sentiment in next year's election in Madhya Pradesh, which has been ruled by the BJP for many years.

The BJP has ruled the state since 2003, with Chief Minister Chouhan following up a big win in the 2013 assembly elections with almost a clean sweep of the state in the 2014 national election. The BJP had won 27 of 29 Lok Sabha seats.

In the 230-member state assembly, it holds 166 seats."

Speaking at a programme in Haridwar yesterday, Ms Hridayesh, who was made the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly recently, said, ""Rawat should take the responsiblity for the party's drubbing as the electoral battle was fought under his leadership.""

She said Mr Rawat himself losing both the seats he had contested was a ""dark chapter of politics"".

Apparently hurt by Ms Hridayesh's outburst, Mr Rawat issued a statement through his former media advisor Surendra Kumar, and said that he had already publicly owned up responsibility for the the Congress's defeat and he is ready to offer himself if party leaders feel he deserves some punishment.

""I have already owned up responsibility for the party's defeat publicly immediately after the polls. Still, if PCC president Kishore Upadhyay and the Leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh want to subject me to some punishment, I readily offer myself,"" Rawat said in the statement.

The Congress was decimated in the recent assembly elections in Uttarakhand as well as the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. In Uttarakhand, the party won 11 out of the total 70 constituencies."
"Gujarat Elections 2017: Congress Leaders Eyeing Chief Minister Position Meet Ahmed Patel","http://www.ndtv.com/ahmedabad-news/gujarat-elections-2017-congress-leaders-eyeing-chief-minister-position-meet-ahmed-patel-1684709","Ahmedabad:                             A couple of Congress leaders in Gujarat, who are vying to become the party's chief ministerial face in the upcoming assembly polls, recently held separate meetings with senior party leader Ahmed Patel.

Mr Patel was recently on a four-day visit to Gujarat and mainly stayed in his hometown Bharuch, where the leader of opposition Shankarsinh Vaghela and party's state unit chief Bharatsinh Solanki, who are currently in the race to become Congress' Chief Minister candidate for the state assembly elections, met him separately.

Several legislators, including Paresh Dhanani, also met Mr Patel to present their side.

Ahead of Mr Patel's visit, a meeting was held on April 17 at Mr Vaghela's residence in Gandhinagar, which was attended by 36 MLAs (out of the total 54 MLAs in the state assembly). Gujarat Congress in-charge Gurudas Kamat was also present there.

During that meeting, the legislators demanded that Mr Vaghela should be made the Chief Minister candidate. They said in case the party decides not to declare a Chief Minister face in the state, Vaghela should be given a ""free hand"" for the elections and he should be made the poll committee in-charge.

Ahmed Patel visited Gujarat a day after the MLAs' meeting at Mr Vaghela's place. According to party sources, some of the legislators, who chose not to attend the previous meeting, met Mr Patel under the leadership of Amreli legislator Paresh Dhanani and opposed making Mr Vaghela as the party's Chief Minister face or the election committee in-charge of the state.

""While Solanki met Patel in Bharuch on Thursday and gave a detailed representation from his side, Vaghela met him yesterday and discussed about the political situation related to the upcoming elections,"" sources added.

Mr Patel told them that a final decision on whether to declare a Chief Minister candidate in Gujarat or not rests with the party high command. Mr Patel left Gujarat yesterday.

State party spokesperson Manish Doshi said, ""Patel is a senior leader of Congress and it is natural for the state leaders to visit him if he is in Gujarat. There is nothing unusual in it,"" he said.

According to Mr Doshi, the discussion between party's state unit president and Patel included a range of issues like political situation in the state and upcoming visit of national vice-president Rahul Gandhi on May 1.

Meanwhile, Gurudas Kamat had yesterday tweeted, ""Met Rahulji (Gandhi) and had a detailed discussion with him over his upcoming rally in Gujarat on May 1 to address a tribal rally.""

Mr Doshi said that the Congress vice president will address a rally at Dediyapada in Bharuch district on May 1."
"Mock Away, Won't End Campaign Against EVMs (Vote Machines): Team Kejriwal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mock-away-wont-end-campaign-against-evms-vote-machines-team-kejriwal-1686147","New Delhi: HighlightsAAP blamed its loss in the civic elections on EVM tampering
'This isn't Modi wave, this is an EVM wave,' said senior leader Gopal Rai
'If EVMs are faulty, how did Kejriwal win Delhi,' asked Amit Shah
                                The campaign against the Electronic Voting Machines or EVMs will continue, no matter what anyone says, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party declared today in face of BJP jibes. The ruling party of Delhi, which made its debut in the civic elections two years after its massive sweep in Assembly polls, came a poor second.

As the trends made the extent of its losses clear, Chief Minister Kejriwal's deputy Manish Sisodia said, ""EVM tampering is the bitter truth of the country's democracy. One can crack jokes on us initially, but fearing being made fun of, we cannot refrain from speaking the truth"".

Following a huddle Mr Kejriwal's residence, the party blamed the loss on what it called an ""EVM wave"" -- an allegation levelled by some parties in the aftermath of the recent round of assembly elections. Delhi minister and senior party leader Gopal Rai said, ""This isn't a Modi wave, this is an EVM wave. The same happened in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand"".

A number of BJP leaders reacted with derision. ""If they stay in the same mode (of blaming EVMs) no one can save them,"" said Vijay Goel. ""If there was EVM tampering, it would have happened in Punjab too,"" pointed out Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.

Party chief Amit Shah weighed in, saying Mr Kejriwal won the 2015 assembly elections on the same EVMs. The UPA 1 and UPA 2 also came to power on those very machines. ""If EVMs are faulty, how did they manage to win? I think everyone should respectfully accept the electorate's decision,"" he said.

But AAP refused to back down. ""I want to ask GVL (Narasimha Rao) why he has written a book on EVMs and said we should adopt ballot boxes,"" retorted party leader Ashutosh. Earlier today, BJP spokesperson Mr Rao had coined a new definition of AAP, tweeting it was ""Absolute Arrogance Personified"".

Mr Sisodia questioned how the BJP, which ""brought an entire research paper, books on EVM tampering"" can say EVMs cannot be tampered."
"Enforcement Directorate Giving Out 'Concocted' Value Of Assets Seized: Virbhadra Singh","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/enforcement-directorate-giving-out-concocted-value-of-assets-seized-virbhadra-singh-1677408","New Delhi:                             Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh today accused the Enforcement Directorate of ""concealing"" facts and giving out a ""concocted"" value of the assets seized by the agency in connection with its money laundering probe against him and others.

""While one expected political opponents to distort facts to drive political mileage, it is a matter of grave concern that a responsible government agency is behaving in such a manner and spreading a canard against me,"" he claimed in a statement.

Mr Singh's reaction came in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attaching a farmhouse in New Delhi having a market value of Rs. 27 crore.

The agency alleged the property in the upmarket south Delhi area of Dera Mandi near Mehrauli was purchased ""out of laundered money through shell firms"".

It indicated that the funds were paid as quid pro quo by the director of a Delhi-based firm for establishing a hydro power plant in Himachal Pradesh's Chamba district.

 Mr Singh said that the Centre had been using its full might to harass and destablise a duly elected government in Himachal Pradesh and ""the ED and CBI were being misused to probe bogus charges against him, even though nothing incriminating had been found so far.""

He also accused the Deputy Director of Income Tax, Faridabad for creating ""baseless and fictitious survey reports and dossiers under instructions from the IT department, Chandigarh.""

""The farmland in question was purchased for only Rs. 1.20 crore by the company Ms Mapple, promoted by my son Vikrmaditya,"" the Congress leader said, adding that he gave Rs. 90 lakh to his son from his personal account through proper banking channels, and the remaining amount was paid from his personal accrued money.

""My family took friendly loans amounting to Rs. 5.90 crore from V Chandersekhar and the amount had been paid back in full with interest long time back and accounted for tax appropriately. It is on record that the said property was purchased for Rs. 1.20 crore, but the ED gave its value at Rs. 27 crore,"" the statement said.

The Chief Minister also alleged that an officer, whose wife is a BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh, was assigned the duty of assessing Maple as Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi. He said that the officer instead of assessing the revenue, made ""malafide conclusions that the property was worth Rs. 27 crore.""

""Now the ED was using the baseless revenue assessment figure of Rs. 27 crore to sensatonalise the matter to malign and defame him,"" he further alleged.

""All this was a matter of record yet my family members have been harassed and persecuted using multiple central agencies since 2013,"" he said.

Mr Singh added that he would take appropriate legal remedies to contest all charges and not only come out clean but also politically victorious.

The Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections are scheduled later this year."
"EVM Tampering: New Voting Machines Won't Work If Tinkered With","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/new-evm-will-stop-working-if-tampered-with-1676469","New Delhi:                             The Election Commission is set to buy next generation electronic voting machines or EVMs that become ""inoperable"" the moment attempts are made to tinker with it, a move which comes amid claims by some parties that the machines were tampered with during the recent assembly polls.

The 'M3'-type EVMs are also equipped with a self-diagnostic system for authentication of genuineness of the machines.

These will come with a public key interface-based mutual authentication system.

Only a ""genuine"" EVM -- manufactured either by atomic energy PSU ECIL or defence PSU BEL -- ""communicates"" with other EVMs in the field.

Any EVM manufactured by other companies would not be able to communicate with other machines, thus exposing it.

Around Rs. 1,940 crore (excluding freight and taxes) will be required to procure the new machines which are likely to be introduced by 2018, a year before when the next Lok Sabha elections are due, the Law Ministry has said, quoting details made available by the Election Commission to be given to Parliament.

The Election Commission has decided to replace 9,30,430 EVMs purchased before 2006 as the older machines are nearing their 15-year life cycle, he said.

On December 7 last, the Union Cabinet had approved a fresh tranche of Rs. 1,009 crore for the Election Commission to buy new EVMs so that it can phase out the ageing ones before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Cabinet had also authorised the Election Commission to vary the quantity to be ordered on BEL and ECIL based on their production capacity and past performance.

On July 20 last, a similar Election Commission proposal to buy nearly 14 lakh new EVMs -- the first tranche -- at a cost of Rs. 9,200 crore during 2016-17 was approved by the Union Cabinet.

In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, the Law Ministry had said that EC has not purchased a single new machine in the last three fiscals.

Minister of State for Law P P Chaudhary had said that the poll panel has informed the government that it had not procured any electronic voting machine during 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17."
"We Are Capable On Our Own: Mulayam Singh Dismisses Son Akhilesh Yadav's Alliance Talk","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mayawati-capable-on-her-own-mulayam-singh-dismisses-sons-alliance-talk-1682117","New Delhi:                             The friction between Mulayam Singh and his son Akhilesh -- buried in the aftermath of the Samajwadi Party's drubbing in the recent assembly elections - has come to the fore again over the suggestion of yet another alliance. On Sunday, the party veteran dismissed the suggestion that arch rival and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati and his party can work together. ""We are capable on our own,"" was the terse response from the Yadav Senior when asked to comment on talks of a grand alliance against the BJP for 2019.

In the process, he contradicted what his son Akhilesh Yadav said barely 24 hours ago.

""There should be a grand alliance. We are in favour of it,"" Mulayam's son and the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had said on Saturday, barely 24 hours after Mayawati said her Bahujan Samaj Patry was ready to work with like-minded parties ""to save democracy"".

The BSP, she said, had no reservations in taking the help of anti-BJP parties in its fight against EVM tampering and the BJP. ""It is democracy which comes first... we have to keep democracy alive,"" she told her party workers in Lucknow on Friday.

The Congress -- which partnered the Samajwadi Party ahead of the elections and had been the cause of another flashpoint in the Yadav family -- offered to mediate. ""Congress would act as a bridge for SP and BSP,"" senior party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar said. ""We have two years before the elections, we can make this alliance a great alliance,"" he said.

A grand alliance had succeeded in Bihar but will it work nationally?

The Left Front said there is a need to make common cause over people's issues. ""There is a possibility of stopping the BJP. And to stop them, there is need for the broadest possible people's action for which all should come together,"" asserted CPI leader D Raja, who, in recent times, has met Akhilesh Yadav, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

Mr Raja admits that in many states ""potential national allies"" are bitter rivals in state. ""There are difficulties in certain states like West Bengal or Tripura. But each party will have to do their own assessment and our assessments may even converge,"" Mr Raja told NDTV. In Bengal and Tripura, the Left is bitterly opposed to Trinamool while in Kerala, Congress is the Left's main electoral rival.

The BJP calls the idea of a grand alliance a non-starter. ""Whether Akhilesh forms alliance or a grand alliance, he won't be able to stop the BJP. People of the nation are with Prime Minister Modi and they want development,"" said Keshav Prasad Maurya, the deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh."
"Will Start Campaign To Unite 'Samajwadis': Shivpal Singh Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/will-start-campaign-to-unite-samajwadis-shivpal-singh-yadav-1677380","Lucknow:                             In a new twist to the feud within the Samajwadi Party, its leader Shivpal Singh Yadav today said he will soon launch a campaign to unite ""samajwadis"" (socialists) to bring them on one platform.

Shivpal, the warring uncle of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, had threatened to launch a new party after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

""We will not let the legacy of 'samajwad' (socialism) to weaken and will soon launch a campaign to unite socialists to bring them on one platform,"" he said here while felicitating Sayed Sagir Ahmad, a senior socialist leader.

""The fight for social justice will be fought with full strength. In the name of Rama, politics of social justice should be done and not of hatred,"" Shivpal said.

After filing his nomination for state polls on January, he had said he would form a new party after the election results are declared. But, subsequently he had said there was no such move.

With Akhilesh snubbing Shivpal and naming Ram Govid Chowdhury the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly and Mulayam Singh Yadav giving the Samajwadi Party's national executive meeting a miss, any patch-up seems unlikely.

In a public outburst against his son, Mulayam on Saturday had said Akhilesh had insulted him and the voters understood that ""one who is not loyal to his father, cannot be loyal to anyone"" which led to the party's poll debacle.

The SP got only 47 seats in the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly, its lowest tally since the party's inception in 1992.

Following a bitter feud between the father and the son, Akhilesh had snatched reins of the party from Mulayam Singh and their fight also reached the Election Commission.

Mulayam, who has since been given the role of party mentor, had openly criticised the Samajwadi-Congress alliance and was virtually absent from the campaign too."

'Instead of reacting to PM Modi, we should set own agenda': He tells her
They also discuss a joint candidate for the post of President
                                A month after the Congress's drubbing in the latest round of assembly elections, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar met its chief Sonia Gandhi for a strategy session today. The meeting with Mrs Gandhi, who recently returned from trip to US for medical treatment, took place at her home in Delhi. Mr Kumar's party described it as a long-overdue courtesy visit. But sources said the chief of the Janata Dal United, Congress's senior partner in the three-party Grand Alliance that kept the BJP at bay in Bihar, has been scouting for allies for a nationwide 'Mahagathbandhan"" to beat them in the 2019 general elections.

The Congress had fallen back on its staple ""introspection"" after the drubbing by the BJP. Sources said Mr Kumar's suggestion to Mrs Gandhi was on the lines of the advice he had given to her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi. ""Instead of reacting to Narendra Modi, we should be setting our own agenda,"" he was quoted as telling her.

Ahead of the latest round of assembly elections, Mrs Gandhi had been away from the public eye, Rahul Gandhi was on the drivers' seat. She had not even campaigned in the family turf of Amethi and Raebareli  -- where the party had managed to win only two of the 10 seats. Her last public appearance was during a rally in Varanasi, when she was taken ill mid-way and had to be brought back to Delhi. Her medical condition has not been revealed by the party.

Today, the two leaders also discussed a joint candidate for the post of the President - Pranab Mukherjee's tenure ends in July. ""Sonia Gandhi being the leader of the largest opposition party should take the lead,"" said JD(U) leader KC Tyagi. Mr Kumar, he said, has already taken up the matter with leaders of the Left parties and received a good response.

There has been speculation that Mr Kumar was considering an alliance with the BJP, fueled by his invitation to BJP leaders for Makar Sankranti feast, his party's deteriorating relation with Lalu Yadav's RJD and the BJP's sweeping victory in Uttar Pradesh. But Congress sources said that Mr Kumar was organising Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran Centenary visit in a grand scale was enough to dispel the impression."
"Performance Review On Agenda As PM Narendra Modi Meets Ministers Today","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/performance-review-on-agenda-as-pm-narendra-modi-meets-ministers-today-1680465","New Delhi:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his cabinet ministers at 3 pm today and this will be followed by a meeting with his entire council of ministers at 4.30 pm. The Prime Minister holds these meetings on the third Wednesday of every month, but could not do so for the last two months because of hectic campaigning that leaders were involved in for the assembly elections in five states.

The Modi government finishes three years next month and ministers are expected to be asked today to list achievements in their departments. A few of them could also make presentations, sources said.

Cabinet ministers have already been asked to list five achievements each in their ministries that have benefited people, including key reforms. They have also been asked to provide data that shows the progress made since the BJP-led government came to power.

Last week, Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu sent a letter to all the ministers explaining that these inputs would be included in a booklet that the government plans to publish before May 26, the day PM Modi took oath three years ago.

The ministers have been asked to make three-page submissions that must be in bullet points only and must list the key performance indicators or KPIs of the department.

Some ministers have been asked to prepare notes on specific sectors. Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar has been asked to write one on the highlights of PM's tours abroad and on increased investment flow from foreign countries.

Earlier this week, the Prime Minister also met over dinner, leaders of 32 parties that are the BJP's allies in the National Democratic Alliance or NDA that it leads over dinner. The allies endorsed the centre's policies and vowed to work together to win a second term under PM Modi's leadership in 2019, union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after the meeting."
"Amit Shah To Campaign For BJP, Visit All States By September","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-campaign-for-bjp-visit-all-states-by-september-1685971","New Delhi:                             BJP chief Amit Shah will visit all states by September-end as part of his campaign to strengthen the party as it readies for another round of assembly polls and the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

He will spend 95 days, as announced by him in the recent national executive in Bhubaneswar, during the drive, which starts from Jammu and Kashmir. He will spend two to three days in each of the states and union territories.

This programme is different from his 15-day tour of five states, which started today with a three-day stay in West Bengal, as the BJP aims at toning up the organisational structure and will not involve much public contact.

""This is for the first time that the president of a party as big as the BJP will be touring all states of the country to strengthen the organisation. We want to make the birth centenary year of Deen Dayal Upadhyay a memorable period in our history,"" party general secretary Arun Singh said.

Deen Dayal Upadhyay is one of the two ideological stalwarts, the other being Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. It has launched a series of nation-wide activities from September 25, 1916 to observe his birth centenary year.

The entire exercise underlines Mr Shah's ambitious plans to increase the party's footprints across the country, especially in electorally important states where it has always been a
fringe player, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

He is especially focusing on Odisha, West Bengal, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu and Telangana, which together send 141 MPs to the Lok Sabha of 543 members, excluding two
nominated members. 

Despite notching up an unprecedented majority in 2014 Lok Sabha polls by winning 282 seats, the BJP could win only five seats in these states.

As it will likely find it a difficult task to repeat its massive sweep of the west India and states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Shah wants it to win more seats in these six states to make up for any fall in its tally in other states."

The Election Commission of India has sought a detailed report from Bhind's District Election Officer after seeing the video of a demonstration organised by state election officials for journalists ahead of by-elections in the state's two assembly seats. It has also sent a high-level team to the state to investigate.

Chief Electoral Officer Shalina Singh later told reporters that they wanted to show how the VVPAT - Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail - would let voters know if the machine voted for the different candidate than the one selected by the candidate. She also rejected claims that the machine voted for the BJP on both occasions.

But the opposition that has been raising questions on the EVMs weren't clearly satisfied.

VVPAT is a machine which dispenses a slip with the party's symbol for which a person has voted for. The slip is visible for seven seconds before it drops in a box.

The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party rushed to the Election Commission's in Delhi, tasking the party's senior leaders to reiterate their concerns with the poll panel that has, in the past, dismissed questions about the neutrality of the machine.

BSP chief Mayawati was the first to question the EVMs after the BJP's massive win in the assembly elections that installed Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. Other opposition parties soon joined in, right from AAP's Arvind Kejriwal who had hoped to come to power in Punjab and the Samajwadi Party that was reduced to double digits in the country's most populous state to the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.

Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said the doubts raised on the EVMs must be investigated. Mr Scindia, who along with party general secretary Digvijaya Singh had approached the panel, said the EC had assured they would take steps.

The Congress general secretary said EVMs should not be used for elections. ""From Advani to Mayawati to Kejriwal, I stand with them on this,"" Mr Singh, otherwise a bitter critic of Mr Kejriwal, said. BJP veteran LK Advani had raised doubts about the possibility of EVMs malfunctioning after the 2009 elections.

Mr Kejriwal too landed at the commission soon after. The Madhya Pradesh example, where the machine allegedly voted for the BJP irrespective of the candidate selected, was another such example where machines only voted for one party. ""If it was because of a fault, why is it that the faulty machines only vote for BJP... why not the Congress or the Samajwadi Party,"" he asked."
"Arvind Kejriwal: As IIT Engineer, Can Share 10 Ways To Rig EVMs","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/this-is-not-a-trailer-arvind-kejriwal-to-ndtv-on-delhi-no-3-result-1681514","New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal's AAP placed third in Delhi by-election
Delhi's local elections coming up later this month
This result not an indicator of how AAP will perform in those, he says
                                Despite bombing in a by-election in Delhi this week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today told NDTV that the people of Delhi are happy with his government. Mr Kejriwal insisted that his Aam Aadmi Party or AAP had foreseen its loss in the election for an assembly seat, but was ""unable to share its message effectively.""

Yesterday, AAP was such a poor third in the by-election that its candidate lost his deposit. The BJP won the seat, the Congress was runner-up. AAP's result was used by both parties to predict a crash-and-burn outcome for Mr Kejriwal in the municipal elections in the capital scheduled for the 23rd. ""This is not a trailer,"" said Mr Kejriwal, referring to the by-election and claiming that AAP was punished because people were upset that the legislator in the constituency that voted, Rajouri Garden, had been moved to contest the recent election in Punjab.

The local elections on the 23rd will measure his popularity mid-way through his term. In 2015, AAP, a political novice, pulled off a win of startling proportion, losing just three seats in Delhi. Of late, the party has been bruised by its inability to win Punjab, where Mr Kejriwal led an extensive campaign, and by a series of indictments for allegedly going rogue on basic guidelines and processes required of the government. Mr Kejriwal has pointed out that the verdicts against him have been delivered by committees created by the centre, which he has long accused of plotting to destabilize him.

In recent days, AAP has been ordered to reimburse the Delhi government 97 crores - the amount spent on ads that allegedly promoted Mr Kejriwal and his party in violation of Supreme Court rules. It has been asked to return a bungalow that it was assigned as a party office. The government has been asked to explain why it tried to pay a 3-crore bill for Ram Jethamalani, one of the country's most famous lawyers, hired to represent Mr Kejriwal in a defamation case filed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. ""I am fighting this case as Chief Minister...the government has every right to hire the best lawyer,"" he said today, when asked why government lawyers were not tasked with his case.

Through these scandals, Mr Kejriwal has kept up a campaign attacking the Election Commission for allowing voting machines to be rigged in Punjab, the only explanation, he says, for his defeat there. ""The Commission is pulling out all stops to help the BJP win,"" he repeated today. ""I am an engineer from IIT... I can tell you 10 ways in which EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) can be tampered,"" he said, challenging the Commission which has said that voting machines cannot be gamed, a premise it hopes to prove through a 10-day open-to-the-public hackathon next month in Delhi."
"Bahujan Samaj Party Stages Sit In In Ghaziabad, Allege Manipulation In Voting Machines","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bahujan-samaj-party-stages-sit-in-in-ghaziabad-allege-manipulation-in-voting-machines-1680165","Ghaziabad:                             Scores of BSP workers today staged a sit in outside the district collectorate in Ghaziabad, alleging the BJP managed a stunning victory in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections by ""tampering"" electronic voting machines.

Addressing the party workers, BSP zonal coordinator Raj Singh said on one hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks about eradication of corruption but on the other, his party acquired absolute majority by ""killing the democracy"" and ""manipulation of EVMs"".

He said BSP president Mayawati had raised the matter soon after the election results and now all other parties were of the same opinion (alleged tampering in EVMs).

He alleged that votes in minorities dominated areas, which were considered BSP vote bank and from where Muslim candidates were in fray, going in favour of the BJP indicated ""foul play"" by the saffron party.

Notably, BSP chief Mayawati, whose party received a major drubbing in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, had alleged that the EVMs were tampered with in such a way that whichever button was pressed, the vote went to BJP soon after election results came out.

Terming the results as ""shocking"", she had said the Election Commission should stop the counting and withhold results and hold fresh polls using traditional paper ballots. She had said it was ""unacceptable"" that the BJP was winning even in Muslim-dominated areas.

""Muslims constitute 20 per cent votes in the state and the BJP did not give a single ticket to Muslims...but in Muslim-dominated seats also the results went in the BJP's favour and this is unpalatable to the party,"" Mayawati had said.

Mr Singh said BSP will continue its protest against the BJP government till the party is removed from power by public. The BSP has already filed a petition in the Supreme Court in this connection, he said, adding re-poll should be conducted in UP using ballot papers."
"Rigged EVMs? Then How Do You Explain Me, Says Amarinder Singh","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rigged-evms-then-how-do-you-explain-me-says-amarinder-singh-1680625","A second senior leader of the Congress has stood up to defend the Electronic Voting Machine or EVM amid the party's allegation of tampering. Amarinder Singh, the chief minister of Punjab - the only state the Congress won outright in the recent round of assembly elections -- cited a simple logic: ""If EVMs were fixed then I wouldn't be sitting here. The Akalis would be.""

The Congress had won 77 of Punjab's 117 seats, ending the decade-long rule of the Akali-BJP alliance. But this morning, it joined the other opposition parties to petition the Election Commission against the use of machines. The parties allege that the machines were rigged, which made the BJP's sweeping victory in recent elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand possible.

But former law minister Veerappa Moily, who represented the Congress at the meeting, said he favoured updating technology and an investigation by a ""high powered committee into the allegations"". There, however, was ""no question of going manually, it's not a progressive step. I don't think we should go back,"" he said.

""We are censoring our own system. EVMs were launched when we were in power,"" Mr Moily told NDTV, standing by his comment that blaming EVMs for electoral losses was ""defeatist."" Concerns about EVMs had been raised even when the Congress was in power, and the machines had been tested, he added.

The statement by the two leaders fly in the face of comments by party leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad, and opposition leaders like Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal and BSP's Mayawati, who had demanded that the Election Commission ditch EVMs and revert to old-style ballot papers.

The Commission, which had repeatedly defended the EVMs, said this afternoon that in May, it would hold a hackathon, in which non-believers could try and hack the machines.

The complaints against the EVMs started after a controversial demonstration of a machine Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district, which had allegedly been used in Kanpur days before.

The opposition parties claimed that the video of a demonstration by an election officer showed an EVM recording a vote in favour of the BJP irrespective of which party was selected. The Election Commission had said the machine in question was an unused VVPAT or Voter Verified Audit Slip Facility, which was kept in reserve during the elections in Uttar Pradesh. The Commission had also pointed out that the 45-day cooling off period that is necessary for an EVM is not required for a VVPAT machine."
"As BJP Eyes Odisha Next, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's Assessment","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-bjp-eyes-odisha-next-chief-minister-naveen-patnaiks-assessment-1679601","New Delhi: HighlightsNaveen Patnaik's BJD pulled out from the BJP led-NDA in 2009
Naveen Patnaik has been Odisha's Chief Minister for the last 17 years
The BJP lost nearly 200 seats in the zila parishad elections in the state
                                Naveen Patnaik says he is not worried about the BJP's strong showing in local elections in Odisha, where assembly elections will be held in 2019. The Odisha chief minister and chief of the Biju Janata Dal says his math shows the BJP's rise ""isn't remarkable at all.""

""It's around 1/3rd in the Zila Parishad. In the wards, etc they did much worse. I don't see this as a great triumph of the BJP. They have taken over Congress pockets,"" Mr Patnaik told NDTV today about the performance of the BJP which is came in a surprising number two in the zila parishad elections across the state, behind Mr Patnaik's BJD, which has ruled Odisha for the last 17 years straight. The BJD lost nearly 200 seats.   

BJP chief Amit Shah has made it clear that after the Gujarat elections late this year, his eyes are set on winning Odisha and the BJP is holding its two-day national convention this weekend in capital Bhubaneshwar, as it bulks up its cadre in the state ahead of the assembly elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr Shah will attend along with other top leaders.

Mr Patnaik dismissed with a smile a recent spat on Twitter between two senior leaders of his party after one, Jay Panda, wrote a newspaper editorial critical of the BJD and its boss. Mr Panda had noted that ""other parties are gaining ground because of their dynamic new leadership,"" prompting his party colleague Tathagat Sathpaty to allege that the BJP was colluding with ""one MP"" to split the BJD.

The chief minister whose party is named for his father Biju Patnaik, said, ""I do not see any discord in the parliamentary party, either in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha."" Both Mr Panda and Mr Satpathy are members of Parliament.   

The BJD was once a BJP ally and even after Mr Patnaik pulled out his party from the National Democratic Alliance in 2009, it has largely served as a friendly party since the BJP came back to power at the Centre in 2014, supporting the government on key legislation. But Mr Patnaik would not comment today on whether  the BJD will support the BJP's choice of nominee for President later this year. ""Let's see who the candidate for the present presidential election will be and we will then make our judgement.,"" he said.

He accused the Modi government of being quite negligent towards Odisha, much like the previous Congress-led regime of Dr Manmohan Singh, he said. ""They have cut off funds for very important programs which the center used to finance. Also, in very important river issues such as Mahanadi and Polavram issue, they haven't been very supportive,"" he complained."
"MCD Election 2017: Voting Begins For Delhi Civic Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mcd-elections-2017-voting-begins-for-delhi-civic-polls-1684791","New Delhi:                             Voting for Delhi Civic Polls began this morning for the 272 wards in which the ruling BJP is locked in a triangular battle with the Congress and the AAP. More than 1.3 crore people are eligible to vote in the Delhi civic elections, spread over 13,000 polling stations across the national capital. Both the BJP and the Congress have exuded confidence about winning the electoral battle while the AAP is seeking to replicate its 2015 Assembly elections performance, despite suffering a debacle in the Rajouri Garden bypoll.

Polling began at 8 am amid tight security arrangements across the city.

Out of the 13,022 polling stations, the police have declared 3,284 as sensitive and 1,464 as hyper-sensitive.

Over 1.1 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise for the first time. Also, for the first time in MCD elections, None Of The Above (NOTA) option has been made available.

There are a total of 1,32,10,206 voters entitled to exercise their franchise in electing councillors for the wards falling under the three corporations - NDMC (104), SDMC (104) and EDMC (64).

Voting will be held till 5 pm. Counting of votes will be held on April 26.

The Delhi State Election Commission has deployed ample staff to man its polling stations, some of which fall in outer Delhi areas.

The wards going to polls include Narela, Okhla, Rajouri Garden, Ballimaran, Nawada, Vikas Nagar, Matiala, Munirka, Bhati, Tehkhand, Khichripur, Jhilmil, Wazirpur, Burari, Tilak Nagar, Kasturba Nagar and Andrews Ganj.

The verdict of the poll will have political ramifications beyond the capital's borders and reshape the political equations.

The BJP is seeking to retain the turf which it has held for the last 10 years and fielded all fresh faces from 267 wards. The party has projected for itself a tally of over 200 out of the 272 seats.

The AAP and the Congress too have claimed that they will cross the 200-mark.

The AAP has fielded candidates on all 272 wards while the Congress has 271 candidates in the fray.

Incidentally, in May last year, bypolls to 13 wards were held, in which the AAP had finished on top with five seats, followed by the Congress with 4, BJP at 3. One seat had gone to an independent candidate.

The AAP which had bagged 67 out of 70 seats in 2015 Delhi polls suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent Rajouri Garden bypoll.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, however, has refused to acknowledge the result as a ""trailer for MCD polls"".

His party has been highlighting ""corruption"" in the BJP-led civic bodies, an issue it seeks to leverage in this contest.

The erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated in 2012 into North, South and East Municipal Corporations.

There are 1,004 candidates vying in the NDMC area, 985 in SDMC and 548 in EDMC.

The BSP and the JD(U) have fielded 211 and 95 candidates respectively while the SP has entered the fray with 28.

The Generation-1 electronic voting machines (EVMs) are being used for the polls, which the Commission has described as ""foolproof"".

This would be the first civic poll after the latest delimitation which has redrawn the civic wards.

As per the new delimitation exercise, based on the 2011 Census, each ward now has an average of 60,000 people with an estimated 40,000 voters.

Delhi has 70 Assembly seats and before the delimitation, every constituency had four wards, but, now it ranges from 3-7.

It was on this day in 1948 that the state came into existence with the merger of 30-odd princely hill states. The Chief Minister said his government has always been considerate towards the welfare of youth and lately it has taken a decision to provide an unemployment allowance as promised in the election manifesto.

The scheme would provide Rs. 1,000 per month to those unemployed who have minimum 102 qualification or above.

Likewise, an allowance of Rs. 1,500 per month would be given to the youths with physical disabilities. Both allowances will benefit 150,000 youths.

The Chief Minister also announced that the period of regularisation of contractual employees would be reduced to three years instead of five.

He announced that the monthly honorarium of Special Police Officers deployed in Chamba district bordering militancy-infested Jammu and Kashmir would be increased to Rs. 6,000 from Rs. 4,000.

There are around 500 Special Police Officers assisting the paramilitary forces after the massacre of 35 people in Churah area by terrorists in 1998.

The Chief Minister unfurled the national flag with the national anthem being played by a Home Guard band.

Singh said the state has been giving priority to upgrading the skills of the unemployed youth. In this regard, the government has implemented the Skill Development Allowance Scheme with an outlay of Rs. 500 crore.

Till date the skill development allowance has been given to 152,000 youth.

His demand comes in the wake of the poll panel throwing an open challenge to hack its EVMs following a chorus by Opposition parties on alleged tampering of the machines in the recent state Assembly elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh where BJP staged a stunning victory.

Mr Singh said the Election Commission, instead of limiting its objections to EVM hacking, should also allow examination of its software at the stage of writing it from the server.

""EC limiting objections to EVMs. It must allow examination of possibility of software tampering at stage of writing it from server. There is a strong possibility of tampering coding at the stage of writing software i.e. EVMs can be pre-tampered. So no need for hacking...

""EC must devise a way of supervision by political parties of the coding software of EVMs, like it does at subsequent stages. Would they agree?"" the Congress leader tweeted.

The Election Commission had announced that from first week of May, experts, scientists and technocrats can try for a week or 10 days to hack the electronic voting machines.

Several opposition parties have demanded that voting in India should return to the old ballot papers system. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, asked the Election Commission and the Centre to explain the delay in switching to upgraded machines that provide a paper receipt (VVAPT), showing the ballot of each voter."
"Arvind Kejriwal On Huge Losses In Punjab, Delhi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-arvind-kejriwal-on-huge-losses-in-punjab-delhi-1681471","Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which held west Delhi's Rajouri Garden assembly constituency, suffered a loss, placing them a faraway number three in by-elections held to the state on Sunday. The upcoming municipal elections are seen as the party's last chance to prove it is still politically relevant, after its poor performance in the Punjab and Goa elections.

Here are the highlights from Party Chief Arvind Kejriwal's interview to NDTV:There is a lot of positivity in Delhi about the work that the state government has done, especially in education, health and waterPeople of Rajouri Garden did not like that Jarnail Singh ""left them"" midwayWe failed to make convince the votersIt will be wrong to see this as a trailer for MCD electionsThe Delhi loss was just an anger against one candidate, nothing moreFor 10 years BJP has been in charge of MCD, you can see how much filth there is on the streets of Delhi; all the dengue, malaria - you can see for yourself. And this is despite all the money they have...clearly it's a loss because of corruptionAAP has worked a lot in the last two years, halved electricity rates, given free waterI am going to see now what kind of EVMs they are going to use...they are bringing back EVMs from junkyards; the Uttar Pradesh Election Commission itself has said they won't accept EVMs older than 2006I am an engineer from IIT...I can tell you 10 ways how EVMs can be tamperedThe chips which are made by two different companies, can be manipulated at source; a bug or a Trojan Horse can be inserted in the chips at the point of originIt is true if we win, it is a referendum on the government and our loss would raise questions on EVMs (in response to a question)If the EVMs are not fixed, our democracy can't be savedIt seems the Election Commission is doing it intentionally, why are they brushing the allegations under the carpet?The Election Commission is pulling out all stops to help the BJP winA candidate from Pune says he got zero votes even though he voted for himselfIf they would have made the Akali's win, it would have raised far graver questions; that's why they helped the Congress winWe will discuss what we did wrong, within the partyWe have shut down the system of donations in colleges, we have taken down the construction mafia, we have hit the drugs mafia; Of course they will unite against usI ask the people, one good thing the BJP has done as in charge of the MCD in the last 10 years; they are so short of cash that they can't pay their employees.On 97 crore allegations: At least the LG admits we did not spend 526 crore on ads.

Election Commission has asked for panel of names to replace the officers
By-polls in Madhya Pradesh's Ater and Bandhavgarh will be held on April 9
                                Ahead of by-elections in two seats, two government officers in Madhya Pradesh have been transferred over the ongoing controversy regarding Electronic Voting Machines. The Election Commission has asked a panel of names to replace the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police of Bhind district.  The order came after reports that machines with the Voter Verified Audit Slip Facility or VVPATs were dispensing slips with the BJP symbol irrespective of which button was pressed.

The by-elections to two assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh -- Ater and Bandhavgarh - will be held on April 9.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who was among the opposition leaders who had alleged tampering of EVMs after the recent round of assembly elections in five states, tweeted:
 
The dig was at the poll panel, which had dismissed the possibility of tampering with EVMs after allegations from AAP, Mayawati's BSP and the Congress.

On Saturday, the Election Commission decided to fly in top election officers from Delhi and Andhra Pradesh to oversee the by-elections in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and address the concerns of the opposition. The panel had also said it would depute two teams its officials and technical experts to ensure that EVMs and VVPATs had not been tampered with.

The move came after a video of a demonstration by the state's election officer, which, opposition parties claimed, showed the EVM recording a vote in favour of the BJP irrespective of which party was selected. The video renewed the fears that EVMs could be tampered, prompting the Congress and AAP's Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal rushing to the panel earlier on Saturday."
"Delhi By-Polls: AAP Faces Litmus, BJP Seeks Revival, Congress Survival","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/delhi-by-polls-aap-faces-litmus-bjp-seeks-revival-congress-survival-1678772","New Delhi:                             By-elections to the West Delhi's Rajouri Garden assembly seat over this weekend could be the trailer to the national capital's municipal elections this month that is seen as a litmus test for the Aam Aadmi Party which won an unprecedented 67 of the 70 seats in 2015 assembly elections.

It would also indicate if the high-pitch campaign by the BJP and the Congress, which were decimated in the state elections two years earlier, had been able to dent AAP's support base. The results for the by-elections will be declared on April 13, ten days before the capital votes for the three civic bodies.

Since 1993, Rajouri Garden had been electing a Congress candidate with the exception of the last two elections when it voted the BJP-Akali Dal combine candidate in 2013, and in 2015, when it gave the AAP a chance. Quite like the rest of Delhi.

AAP legislator Jarnail Singh had quit the seat after the party decided to field him in this week's Punjab assembly elections against the Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal, necessitating the by-elections. Singh lost, but he isn't coming back to Delhi.

The party has come up with a new face - Harjeet Singh - for the election. The BJP-SAD combine has fielded veteran Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who had won the seat in 2013 but lost out by about 10,000 votes in 2015. He received about 44,000 votes.

The Congress, which ruled the city for 15 years at a stretch, is leaving no stone unturned to pull off a victory and register its presence in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

The seat fell vacant early this year after AAP's Jarnail Singh quit as MLA to contest Punjab Assembly poll against SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal, only to lose and considerably dent AAP's chances of holding on to the seat.

While Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal addressed one rally in the area, the Congress brought in newly elected Punjab CM Amarinder Singh to address the voters in constituency dominated by the Punjabi community. The two had several feuds in the run up to the Punjab polls where Amarinder, a Congress giant, trounced the Kejriwal-led AAP and relegated the BJP-SAD to the third position.

"BJP Strong No 2 In West Bengal By-Poll, Top Leaders Assigned To Win State","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-strong-no-2-in-west-bengal-by-poll-top-leaders-assigned-to-win-state-1681456","Kolkata:                             After shocking the Left by placing second in this week's assembly by-election in West Bengal behind the ruling Trinamool Congress, the BJP has launched a 'Mission Bengal' that aims at preparing the party to make major inroads in the panchayat or local elections to be held next year. The party is sending senior leaders to West Bengal to interact with workers as it builds its cadre in a state where it held no assembly seats till last year's election.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was in Hooghly yesterday, and today, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharati are in Kolkata and Howrah.

The Kanthi Dakshin assembly constituency yesterday sent a Trinamool Congress legislator to the Bengal assembly again, but it was the BJP's performace that drew all the attention. The party placed second, ahead of number 3 Left by at least 30,000 votes. BJP chief Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted special thanks to West Bengal's voters and Mr Shah declared the BJP ""the principal opposition party"" in the state.

In assembly elections less than a year ago, the BJP had placed a distant third behind the Trinamool and the Left in Kanthi Dakshin, with only 15,000 votes and less than 9 per cent vote share. It has almost 31 per cent of the vote share this time.

The Trinamool has improved its vote share by two per cent. The Left, which ruled the state for three decades before losing to Mamata Banerjee in 2011, has only 10 per cent of the vote share this time, while the Congress, main opposition for years, is a faraway fourth with a little over one per cent.

Ahead of the by-election, the BJP and its ideological mentor the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worked hard to expand the party's footprint in East Midnapore where Kanthi Dakshin is. The BJP's strong performance in the Trinamool stronghold is also being credited to its Ram Navami mobilisation.

Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attacked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's government on Thursday, saying, ""Ram Navami celebrations have happened peacefully everywhere in India. Why is it not happening in West Bengal? And why should you stop just one community from celebrating festivals? It's a total failure of the law and order machinery here.""

The Trinamool Congress said it was unaffected as the BJP has gained at the cost of the Left.  ""We are here to come first and between the first and second the difference is so huge that it does not matter who is second and who is third,"" said Trinamool General Secretary Mukul Roy.

But the BJP leadership has made clear it is not in Bengal to play second fiddle for too long. The party, which had no almost no political presence in the state till a few years ago, first made an impact in the 2014 national elections. It won only two Lok Sabha seats, but increased its vote share in the state from four to 17 per cent. In last year's assembly elections in West Bengal, the BJP won four seats.

The BJP is strategically working his way up in states where the party has not traditionally been a major player, building cadre strength at the grass roots and focusing on winning local elections.

"PM Narendra Modi's Breakfast With Gujarat Lawmakers Including LK Advani","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modis-breakfast-with-gujarat-lawmakers-including-lk-advani-1672998","New Delhi: HighlightsGujarat scheduled to vote by December
PM hosts breakfast for party MPs from Gujarat, Rajasthan
Yesterday, he met with Uttar Pradesh MPs
                                Today, it was the turn of the BJP's parliamentarians from Gujarat and Rajasthan to breakfast with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence. The PM met with nearly 50 of them to discuss the election that's due in December in his home state of Gujarat.

Yesterday, MPs from Uttar Pradesh were hosted by the Prime Minister to celebrate the party's tremendous win in the politically-strategic state. They were also cautioned against seeking favours from the new Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath. Mr Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah said Yogi Adityanath must be allowed to focus on turning around the law and order problems in UP, and that phoning him to influence the transfer of officials or to seek appointments for friends and family is strictly off-limits.

After the BJP's blazing victory in Uttar Pradesh, there have been reports that the government will seek to advance the election in Gujarat to benefit from the famous ""Modi Wave."" Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told NDTV last week that the party in Gujarat will be ""ready for early elections, if needed.""

The BJP, which has governed Gujarat uninterrupted for 19 years has announced ""Mission 150"" - winning at least 150 of the state's 182 assembly constituencies. The party currently has 123 seats.

Party veteran LK Advani, who represents Gandhinagar in Lok Sabha, attended PM Modi's breakfast as did Union minister Smriti Irani. BJP chief Amit Shah, who was also present, will travel to Gujarat at the end of the month.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been campaigning for months for his Aam Admi Party (AAP) in the PM's home state, vowing to serve as the people's choice at a time when the BJP is facing anti-incumbency and the Congress is considered irrelevant and ineffectual as the main opposition party. However, AAP's inability to win Punjab in the elections that concluded this month will curb some of the momentum it was gaining in Gujarat, its leaders have ceded."
"'Victory In November,' Says Amit Shah, Shutting Early Gujarat Poll Talk","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gujarat-elections-wont-be-early-suggest-amit-shah-but-makes-odisha-target-clear-1675061","Ahmedabad:                             BJP chief Amit Shah put a lid on speculation that the party could opt for early elections in Gujarat when he said today that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""victory chariot"" will roll into his home state in November. Assembly elections are due in the state only in November end, but there has been buzz that the ruling BJP could call early elections to cash in on a surge in popularity evidenced by party's massive victory in Uttar Pradesh.  

Mr Shah, who too is from Gujarat and is visiting the state for the first time after the party's success this month in assembly elections, was being felicitated by party workers at the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad when he said, ""Narendra bhai's vijay rath, after traversing through the country will move into the state in November. Are you ready to give it a rousing welcome and work towards the party's success?""

The BJP has ruled Gujarat for the last two decades including 13 years when PM Modi was Chief Minister, but the state has been cause for worry for the party recently because of big agitations by the powerful Patel community and by Dalits. It also fears an anti-incumbency sentiment in the state since PM Modi moved to the centre three years ago and many see wisdom in calling early elections.  

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani did not rule it out earlier this week, only saying that the party's central leadership would take a final decision. ""I would like to say that the state BJP is ready for polls, if they are held earlier or even if they are held on schedule,"" he said

The BJP has installed governments in four of the five states where elections have held so far this year. Mr Shah said after winning Gujarat, the party would focus on forming government in Odisha, where elections will be held in 2019.

The BJP chief confirmed that the party's win in UP will be a big theme in its campaign for Gujarat when he said, ""We had taken a vow on the banks of the Ganga that we will cross the 300 seat target in UP and now on the banks of the Sabarmati, we are repeating the vow that we will win 150 plus seats in Gujarat.""

The party has identified UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as a star campaigner in Gujarat apart from PM Modi and Mr Shah.  

The BJP chief dismissed chief rival in Gujarat, the Congress, and also Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party as non-starters. The Congress' ""dream"" to wrest Gujarat from the BJP would remain just that, he said.

AAP makes its debut in Gujarat in this year's assembly election. The party, which had swept Delhi two years ago, had hoped to add Punjab and Goa to its kitty in this year's assembly election, but failed to make a mark in either state. ""During elections AAP emerges like mushrooms, only to fade away,'' observed Amit Shah."
"BJP Protests Against Trinamool Congress Leaders Seen In Narada Sting","http://www.ndtv.com/kolkata-news/bjp-protests-against-trinamool-congress-leaders-seen-in-narada-sting-1672440","Kolkata:                             The BJP in Kolkata on Wednesday hit the streets demanding the resignation of Trinamool Congress lawmakers and ministers who were allegedly seen on tape accepting bribes for favours. The Narada sting was released just before the assembly elections in West Bengal last year but last week the Calcutta High Court said prima facie it seemed to be a cognizable offence and ordered the CBI to investigate. The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court after leaders of Mamata Banerjee's party appealed against the move.

BJP protesters, who marched from College Square near the party office to Esplanade less than 5 km away, got into a scuffle with the police at Esplanade as the police put up barriers to stop the protesters from entering the main square at Esplanade. An effigy with the faces of the politicians seen in the Narada sting was burnt right beside the barricade. ""Not just the Minister seen in the tape, the Chief Minister should also resign as she is leading a corrupt government,"" BJP leader Chandra Bose said. Mr Bose had contested against Mamata Banerjee in the Assembly elections last year.

""Make room for 30-40 people in jail. First start with 12 people and gradually all the secrets will be out in and the space in jail will run out. TMC has big leaders, it will take time to make 5 star arrangements inside the jail,"" Rajya Sabha lawmaker and BJP leader Roopa Ganguly said.

But it's not just the BJP that is upping the ante against Mamata Banerjee as the Trinamool finds itself in an embarrassing position after the Narada sting operation. The Congress has planned a similar rally in the city on Saturday and the Left is also targeting Mamata Banerjee for protecting her partymen.

""The administration is busy protecting the culprits and falsely implicating the whistle-blower. Now, Mamata will have to rush to Modi government to seek support to save themselves from CBI probe,"" CPI(M) lawmaker Mohammad Salim said.

Meanwhile, the man behind the Narada sting operation case, Mathew Samuel has complained to the Kerala Director General of Police and the Station House Officer (SHO) of Dwarka Police Station in the capital about a threat to him, his family and colleagues after what he describes as several instances of his colleagues and family members being followed by unknown men. Mr Samuel has claimed the suspicious people shadowing him could be an attempt to eliminate him and has demanded an inquiry."
"Donald Trump Calls PM Narendra Modi, Congratulates Him On Poll Wins","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/donald-trump-calls-pm-narendra-modi-congratulates-him-for-up-victory-1674161","New Delhi:                             US President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday evening and congratulated him on the BJP's huge success in the recent state elections.

""The president spoke with Chancellor Merkel and the Indian Prime Minister today to congratulate them on their party's success in recent elections,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday.

The BJP rode a Modi super-wave to a massive victory in Uttar Pradesh earlier this month, winning 312 of the state's 403 seats. The BJP also swept neighbouring Uttarakhand and formed governments in Goa and Manipur, with no party getting a majority. The only setback the BJP saw was in Punjab, where the Congress won.

The elections in the five states had turned into a virtual referendum on PM Modi's popularity following his decision to demonetise Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 currency notes.

This is the second time Mr Trump has called PM Modi ever since his inauguration as President of the United States. The leaders of the world's two biggest democracies last spoke in January when President Trump called up PM Modi and discussed the security situation in South and Central Asia. India and the United States will ""stand shoulder to shoulder"" to fight global terrorism, the White House had said after that interaction.

The significance of US' partnership with India was reflected in the fact that President Trump called Prime Minister Modi before he spoke with important allies like Britain, Germany and Japan or major powers like China and Russia since formally taking office.

During that call, President Trump had emphasised that the United States ""considers India a true friend and partner in addressing challenges around the world,"" according to a White House readout of the call.

Both the leaders invited each other to their respective capitals and indicated that they had a warm exchange which included a commitment to ""standing shoulder to shoulder"" against terrorism and improving economic cooperation."
"Amarinder Singh, Man On A Mission, Bans 'Lal Battis' In Punjab. That Includes The Chief Minister.","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-man-on-a-mission-bans-lal-battis-in-punjab-that-includes-the-chief-minister-1671312","Chandigarh:                             Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered the removal of beacons from all government vehicles, including his own. Mr Singh seems to be a man on a mission to revive the Congress, which has been performing poorly in elections in other states. After getting a majority in Punjab's recently-held assembly elections, the Chief Minister seized the opportunity and swung into action. Putting a ban on the use of 'lal battis', or red beacons on government vehicles is one of the first major decisions taken by the new government in the state.

""Red beacons were removed from the vehicles of the Chief Minister and other members of the council of ministers on Saturday itself, without waiting for a notification, soon after the Congress government decided to put a ban on its use,"" an official spokesperson said.

In a series of austere measures, the Amarinder Singh-led cabinet also decided to ban ministers from traveling overseas for two years. It also banned organising of banquets on state expense as part of the government's move to shed VIP frills. This, the party says, is in line with their election manifesto. ""In our manifesto, the Chief Minister and cabinet ministers were exempted. Despite this they decided to bring themselves within the ambit of the decision,"" the Congress' spokesperson said.

Punjab is currently burdened by a huge debt inherited from the previous government in the state. This has been done ""to clean up the system of the much-talked-about VIP culture, that has been a massive expense on the state's exchequer over the years,"" the party's spokesman added.

During the previous government, Punjab, which was already under thousands of crores of rupees in debt, had spent Rs. 97 crore to buy luxury vehicles for its political top brass over a period of eight years, an RTI application had revealed in June last year. The vehicles were purchased between 2007 and 2015 by the transport department for the use of then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, his son and then Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and other ministers, as per the Right to Information (RTI) reply given to activist Jasdeepak Singh.

The transport department in Punjab had spent the highest - Rs. 17,77,92,929 in 2012-2013 on vehicles and Rs. 8,38,28,895 in 2008-09. The expenditure incurred during 2014-15 was Rs. 13,13,90,655.

The process of finalisation of the policy on the use of red beacons on government vehicles, except those used in an emergency like ambulance or fire brigade, and those of the Chief Justice and the Judges of Punjab and Haryana High Court, has started. ""Once the necessary notification is issued, all government departments would have to strictly implement it,"" Congress' spokesperson added.

The process of implementation of other cabinet decisions has also been initiated, the spokesperson said, adding that all decisions would be executed in a time-bound manner, with the Chief Minister and the ministers personally monitoring it to ensure that there is no default or delay.

The Amarinder Singh cabinet, in its first meeting on Saturday, has taken over 120 decisions."
"For Delhi Civic Polls, It Will Be Campaigner Yogi Adityanath Versus Arvind Kejriwal","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/for-delhi-civic-polls-it-will-be-campaigner-yogi-adityanath-versus-arvind-kejriwal-1674543","New Delhi:                             Yogi Adityanath's stock is high as a star campaigner after the BJP's massive win in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The UP Chief Minister, already pencilled in to campaign for the party in the crucial Gujarat assembly elections later this year, will also be seen in Delhi, where he headlines a power-packed star cast of campaigners for the municipal elections month.

The BJP, having dominated the Municipal Corporation of Delhi or MCD for years, is taking no chances; it has been challenged this time by Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which has focused all its attention on winning the civic election after faring poorly in assembly elections in Punjab and Goa.

Apart from Yogi Adityanath, who took oath last week as UP chief minister, four other BJP chief ministers and 14 central ministers feature in the BJP's list of star campaigners for the Delhi civic poll. The party's core team for the election has four union ministers - Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh, Sanjeev Balyan and Vijay Goel.

To stave off any anti-incumbency sentiment, the BJP has said it will field new faces for all the 272 seats in the civic bodies - North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporations, together the MCD. No sitting councillors or their family members will be fielded, the party has decided. On Monday, party chief Amit Shah held two separate meetings with union ministers, members of Parliament and the party's Delhi leaders to discuss strategy.

The Aam Aadmi Party, having failed to spread its influence it other states, is now attempting to extend its success in the Delhi assembly elections, two years ago, to the ward-level in the capital. The BJP, trounced in that election, will mark AAP candidate for candidate in the MCD polls, and Amit Shah has ordered that only residents of a certain ward must be fielded there.

The party heads into the Delhi local elections with a string of successes in municipal polls behind it, most recently in Maharashtra and Odisha.

Polling for the 272 wards of the MCD will be held on April 23."
"Yogi Adityanath To Campaign For BJP In Gujarat Elections","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-to-campaign-for-bjp-in-gujarat-elections-1674127","New Delhi:                             The Gujarat state assembly elections will have one more star campaigner in newly-anointed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to canvass for the ruling BJP, which is seeking a sixth re-election to power in a row since 1995.

Confirming that Yogi Adityanath will campaign in Gujarat, state BJP president Jitu Vaghani said, ""All chief ministers of our party across the country have been invited to campaign and Yogi ji will also be there.""

State party spokesperson Bharat Pandya added that the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister campaigning in Gujarat would help the party immensely.

He said, ""Yogi ji's work as Chief Minister is being discussed and appreciated not just at the national level but even at the international level. So, his coming to Gujarat for campaigning will definitely help the BJP.""

Mr Pandya said Uttar Pradesh is the largest state in the country in terms of population and developments there have massive impact in all other states.

The BJP spokesperson, however, was quick to add that there was no replacement of Modi. ""Ever since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, it has been a matter of pride for people in Gujarat and for us...Modi wave itself is enough,"" Mr Pandya said.

The opposition Congress asserted that the BJP was trying to play its old game of communal polarisation by calling Yogi Adityanath to canvass. Party spokesperson Himanshu Patel said it would not help the BJP this time around.

""People are fed up of the BJP rule and all issues like atrocities against Dalits, women, Patels, farmers and contract employees of the government will go against it,"" he said."
"Prashant Kishor To Decide On Joining Congress Within 15 Days: Sources","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-congress-gushes-over-prashant-kishor-he-could-join-the-party-sources-1671874","New Delhi: HighlightsPrashant Kishor handled Congress election strategy for UP, Punjab
Credited by Captain Amarinder Singh for Punjab win
He's talking to team about joining Congress, say sources
                                Five days ago, a poster at the Congress office in Lucknow called out Prashant Kishor, sarcastically offering five lakhs for any information on the election strategist's coordinates. The poster was brought down hurriedly on the orders of senior leaders, the partyman responsible for it was suspended for six years, and on Tuesday, the Congress gushed on Twitter about Mr Kishor, offering some belated TLC to the 40-year-old while crediting him with a big role in the party's victory in Punjab.

Through the inquest of the Congress' debacle in Uttar Pradesh - one of three states that he managed - Mr Kishor has not commented on either his own or the party's missteps, or what relationship they will have in the future. This morning, sources close to him said that over the next two weeks, Mr Kishor will consult with top members of his team - the data-crunching, election start-up called I-PAC or the Indian Political Action Committee - to explore whether any future association with the Congress should be as ""an insider"" - a member of the party, as opposed to an adjunct position, however senior.

However, top aides at I-PAC said later in the day - after NDTV reported the story - that ""even speculation of him joining the Congress is completely premature.""
 Prashant Kishor handled Congress election strategy for UP and Punjab. Mr Kishor, whose antipathy for interviews is well-established, has said in the past that he has no wish to enter politics. But sources say that the Uttar Pradesh Project has taught him that the a section of the Congress used his status as a consultant both to curb his influence and to brand him as a big reason for its worst-ever result in India's politically most strategic state - it won just seven of 403 seats. Any future assignments, said Mr Kishor's aides on the condition of anonymity, would need to guarantee him the sort of access, time and input that allowed him to chart a winning campaign for Captain Amarinder Singh in Punjab.

On Twitter today, the Captain, who brought the Congress back to power in Punjab after 10 years, purveying the party with its sole sweet spot in the recent elections, thanked Mr Kishor.

Sources in Mr Kishor's team say that he continues to enjoy the confidence of Congress bosses Rahul Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka. As the strategist surveys his options, the election in Gujarat will be a crucial factor. The BJP has ruled Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state for 19 years uninterrupted. The Congress is, like in many other states, a spent force in Gujarat.  And the emphatic defeat of Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party or AAP in Punjab significantly depletes its chances of serving as a formidable challenger.

Considered an election wunderkind after he was credited with devising a high-tech and innovative campaign for PM Modi in 2012, he was hired by the Congress in 2016 to help change its fortune. He signed up to manage the party's strategy in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab and then, belatedly, in Uttarakhand. In Punjab, he found a willing and tireless ally in Captain Singh, at whose home he stayed, a fact often referred to by both men when reports emerged of clashes over selecting candidates and other key issues. 
 Despite the UP debacle, sources say Prashant Kishor continues to enjoy the confidence of Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka.Sources close to the strategist say that when attributing culpability for the Congress' performance in Uttar Pradesh, it's important to remember that Mr Kishor's early suggestions that were devised as ""game-changers""- including the promotion of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as the presumptive Chief Minister- were rejected.  He did his best, they say, given the determined opposition from the party's old guard, leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad and Raj Babbar, who were reportedly distrusting of Mr Kishor's ideas and his easy access to the Gandhi family."
"Will Abolish RUSA If BJP Comes To Power, Says Himachal Pradesh Ex-CM P K Dhumal","http://www.ndtv.com/education/will-abolish-rusa-if-bjp-comes-to-power-says-himachal-pradesh-ex-cm-p-k-dhumal-1672637","Terming the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan as ""faulty"", senior BJP leader P K Dhumal today said if the party forms government in Himachal Pradesh, it will abolish the education scheme from the state. ""If we come to power, our first step would be to abolish the faulty RUSA scheme from the education system of Himachal Pradesh,"" he said at a gathering held under the BJP's 'Mafia Raj Hatao, Pradesh Bachao' campaign here. He alleged that results were being delayed after the scheme was implemented by the Congress government.

The BJP has planned to hold 100 such gatherings under the campaign before the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections, slated later this year. ""The Virbhadra Singh-led government had announced to open around 46 government colleges. One such college was recently opened in a primary school's building in Kangra district's Lunj area. The state government has made a mockery out of the education system in the state,"" he said.

The former chief minister claimed that the law and order situation had deteriorated under the present dispensation. ""Sand from the Yamuna river is being taken to Uttarakhand. The 'Transfer Mafia' is working from the Chief Minister's office and 480 Deodhar trees have been cut in Taradevi. The 'Drug Mafia' is also operating in the state,"" Dhumal alleged. He claimed that of the 85 candidates selected for Class IV posts in the Secretariat only three were from Himachal Pradesh's largest district, Kangra.

                                Congress's Digvijaya Singh today hit out at Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar who, on Friday, took a dig at him by thanking Mr Singh for failing to install a Congress government in the state despite winning the most seats in the assembly elections

Mr Singh, who alleged that the BJP indulged in buying of lawmakers in the state, tweeted this morning, ""If he (Manohar Parrikar) has to thank anyone it is Nitin Gadkari who did aggressive MLA Shopping on 12th March early morning from Hotel in Goa.""

Demanding apology from the BJP, Mr Singh said, ""Shame on you Mr Parrikar and your hunger for power. You have cheated the People of Goa. Apologise to them.""

Digvijaya Singh also alleged that the Goa Governor Mridula Sinha ""robbed the mandate of people"".

Mr Parrikar, who resigned as the country's Defence Minister to return to his home state earlier this month, visited the Rajya Sabha on Friday during Zero Hour to thank the members of the House.

While thanking the members of the House he took a dig at Digvijaya Singh, who was the leader in-charge of Goa during assembly elections. ""My special thanks to honourable member Digvijaya Singh, who happened to be in Goa but did nothing so that I could form the government.""

In election results announced earlier this month, no party won a majority in Goa. The BJP, which won fewer seats than the Congress, quickly gathered the support of regional parties and staked claim to form government. The Congress and its senior leader in-charge of the state Digvijaya Singh could only watch helplessly as Mr Parrikar resigned at the centre and took oath as Chief Minister, winning a vote of confidence the same weekend.

Many state Congress leaders have blamed Digvijaya Singh for the party failing to form government in Goa.Digvijaya Singh has alleged that Goa Governor Mridula Sinha should not have invited the BJP to form government without consulting the Congress as single largest party in Goa, and had moved a motion in the Rajya Sabha to discuss her conduct. It has not been taken up yet.

Manohar Parrikar had resigned as Goa Chief Minister in 2014 to come to the centre as Defence Minister and a Rajya Sabha MP. Since he did not contest this year's Goa polls, he will now have to be elected from an assembly seat in the state within six months."

                                Amit Shah, Gujarat legislator, arrived at the state assembly in Gandhinagar on Thursday morning to a huge welcome from hundreds of BJP workers and also MLAs and ministers. The BJP chief, who is the party MLA from the Naranpura constituency, is attending an assembly session after two years. Mr Shah had last attended a session in March, 2015.

The BJP chief was accompanied by his wife and son. Among those who greeted him with flowers was the BJP's state chief Jitu Vaghani and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.  

Amit Shah is on a two-day visit to his home state to take stock of preparations for state elections later this year and is holding multiple meetings with top party leaders in the state.
 Amit Shah being garlanded by party workers at a BJP function at Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad
At a big reception hosted yesterday by the party to felicitate Mr Shah for the BJP's enormous victory in Uttar Pradesh, he ruled out calling early elections in the state by saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""victory chariot"" would roll into Gujarat in November. Elections are due in Gujarat in November end.

He has set the state leaders a target of winning 150 of Gujarat's 182 assembly seats, demanding a repeat of UP, where the party has won over 300 seats as it had pledged, he said.

The BJP has ruled Gujarat for the last two decades decimating chief rival Congress, but this year it faces its toughest battle in years. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi - whose 13-year stint as Gujarat chief minister was the party's golden period in the state - moving to Delhi after the 2014 national election, the BJP lost its momentum under his successor Anandiben Patel.

She was seen to mishandle the massive agitation for reservation in government jobs and colleges by the powerful Patel community and finally resigned last year citing old age. Vijay Rupani, seen as an Amit Shah man, was given the tough charge of leading the party to this year's election.

The BJP also fears an anti-incumbency sentiment, and is expected to build its campaign in Gujarat around the popularity of PM Modi as it did in UP. The talk of early elections in Gujarat had begun as suggestions were made that the party could cash in on the UP wave."
"Big Test For N Biren Singh, BJP's First Chief Minister In Manipur, Today","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/big-test-for-bjps-first-chief-minister-in-manipur-today-1671249","Imphal:                             BJP's N Biren Singh, who took oath as Manipur's Chief Minister on March 15, has to prove his majority in the state assembly today. Despite being the second largest party - with 21 legislators - in the recently-concluded assembly elections, the BJP claims to have the support of 33 legislators with the help of regional parties and independent lawmakers. Hours before the crucial trust vote, the economic blockade in the state, which lasted for 130 days, was lifted. The blockade, which was led by the United Naga Council, ended after talks were successful with the central and state governments. ""We have fulfilled the promise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi by convincing the UNC to lift the blockade,"" Chief Minister Biren Singh told NDTV last evening. PM Modi had vowed to remove the blockade if BJP was elected to power in a state ruled by the Congress for 15 years under Okram Ibobi Singh. This is the first time a BJP government is heading the state.

The BJP and the Congress are keeping their cards close to the chest ahead of today's crucial trust vote in the Manipur Assembly. 17 of the BJP's 21 newly elected legislators have been camping at a hotel in Assam's Guwahati. The Congress, on the other hand, has sheltered its 27 MLAs in the house of one of its legislators in Imphal. ""We have kept our legislators in Guwahati in response to the Congress keeping their MLAs in a house in Imphal. Our legislators thought we must also stand united,"" said Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP's key strategist for Manipur.

No party received a simple majority in the 2017 Manipur assembly election. The Congress, which had ruled the state for 3 consecutive terms (15 years), emerged as a single largest party with 28 of the total 60 seats. The BJP, which debuted in the state, came second with 21 seats. A party needs a minimum support of 31 legislators to form a government in Manipur.

The BJP says it has the support of 33 legislators with the help of the NPP, NPF, LJP, an independent legislator, a Trinamool Congress MLA, and Shyam Kumar - a defector from the Congress - who took oath as a minister in the N Biren Singh government. Speaking to NDTV, Trinamool Congress legislator Robindro Singh said the party gave him full freedom to support the BJP. ""I spoke to (senior TMC leader) Mukul Roy. They left it to me. They said if you can do well by supporting the BJP, then you can take your own call,"" he said.

In less than a week since being elected Chief Minister, N Biren Singh's government successfully lifted the economic blockade that had crippled the state's supply lines for the last 130 days. ""This is a good beginning of good governance,"" Mr Singh told NDTV. A joint statement released after the meeting stated that there would be ""unconditional release of the arrested UNC leaders and all cases related to the economic blockade against the Naga tribe leaders and student leaders will be closed"".  It also said that the next round of talks will be held within a month.

Governor Najma Heptulla said the first step of the newly formed government led by the BJP ""will usher in an era of peace and prosperity"" in the north-eastern state.

The Naga groups had called for a blockade on November 1 last year after the erstwhile Congress government of Chief Minister Ibobi Singh carved out seven new districts in the state, especially in the Naga dominated areas. The Naga leadership had called it an attack on its tribal lands and cultural integrity protected under the constitution.

The protesters had cut off the two main highways - NH2 and NH 37 - depriving the state of essential commodities. Long queues at fuel stations had become a common sight in the state capital of Imphal where the price of LPG cylinders shot up to Rs. 2,000 each in the black market. Paramilitary forces were also mobilised in the state after incidents of violence.

Multiple rounds of talks in Imphal and Delhi were inconclusive. Union Minister Kiren Rijiju had alleged that the blockade was the ""handiwork"" of the state's then Chief Minister."
"Thanks But No Thanks, Parkash Singh Badal Says To Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's Offer","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/parkash-singh-badal-politely-declines-punjab-chief-ministers-offer-for-government-house-1671190","Chandigarh:                             Former Chief Minister of Punjab Parkash Singh Badal, who helmed the state for 10 years, is hunting for a house nowadays. On Sunday, he ""politely"" declined the new Congress government's offer of free government accommodation in the state capital Chandigarh.

The Amarinder Singh-government had offered a suitable bungalow to Badal, a five-time Chief Minister of Punjab.

Mr Badal said, ""I am thankful to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for his gracious gesture. It is very graceful of him to make this offer. But I am making my own arrangements for stay. I value his sentiment highly and fully reciprocate it.""

The veteran Akali leader's aides are hunting for a house for him in the town's Sector 8 for a week now.

Mr Badal's family owns two big-sized plots of residential land, measuring almost 1.5 acres, in upscale Sector 9, but a new structure is coming up after the old one was pulled down.

Mr Badal, 89, lived in the chief ministerial bungalow in Chandigarh's tony Sector 2 before his Shiromani Akali Dal was routed in the February 4 assembly elections.

Since Mr Badal is only a legislator from Lambi and his party has only 15 legislators in the new assembly, he does not qualify for the status of Leader of Opposition and hence not officially entitled to a government bungalow.

According to reports, the SAD-BJP alliance lost the elections due to a drop in the vote share. The alliance received a 31 per cent vote share while the Congress and the AAP got 38 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal added.

Mr Badal, the country's oldest serving Chief Minister till his party was decimated in the electoral battle, did not attend the swearing in of the new Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on March 16."
"BJP In Gujarat Is Clear On Star Campaigners: PM Modi And Yogi Adityanath","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-in-gujarat-is-clear-on-star-campaigners-pm-modi-and-yogi-adityanath-1674306","Gandhinagar: HighlightsGujarat assembly election to be held by December
BJP seeking fifth consecutive term
Yogi Adityanath will be a top campaigner, says party
                                Yogi Adityanath will be among the show-stoppers that the BJP will use in its campaign in Gujarat, where elections are due by December. The 44-year-old Yogi or monk was the surprise pick for Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh two weeks ago. ""All Chief Ministers of our party across the country have been invited to campaign and Yogi ji will also be there,"" confirmed Jitu Vaghani, who heads the BJP in the state.

""Yogi ji's work as Chief Minister is being discussed and appreciated not just at the national level but even at the international level. So, his coming to Gujarat for campaigning will definitely help the BJP,"" he professed. Since taking office, Yogi Adityanath has operated in top gear, implementing major policies important to the BJP even though the new cabinet has yet to meet. The police is patrolling public spaces to protect women as part of the Yogi's commitment to urgently correcting Uttar Pradesh's depraved lawlessness; slaughterhouses are being checked and sealed for violating laws, a move that critics say targets Muslims who run most abattoirs.

The Chief Minister's surprise check at a police station in the heart of Lucknow and along the banks of the River Gomti to ensure the newly-developed area is pristine, his visit to a gang-rape survivor in hospital, his announcement that his administration will favour no caste or religion, have all given him prime positioning in the news cycle. The BJP in Gujarat says that because of its size and political vitality, UP and its Chief Minister will influence voters heavily in the coastal state too.

However, the party was quick to stress that nothing competes with the star power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Ever since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, it has been a matter of pride for people in Gujarat and for us... the Modi wave itself is enough,"" said Mr Pandya, referring to the pole position of the PM in his party's sweeping victory in Uttar Pradesh.

The BJP has governed the PM's home state of Gujarat since 1998; it is seeking a fifth consecutive term. The party has deployed the slogan ""UP mein 325, Gujarat mein 150"" (325 seats in UP, 150 in Gujarat) to indicate it wants to win the upcoming election with the sort of record margin it accrued in India's most-populous state.

The opposition Congress claims that the BJP's invite to the Yogi signals its plan to polarise voters by religion. Party spokesperson Himanshu Patel claimed that the plan will not succeed and that the BJP will stumble over its conflict with former supporters the Patels, who have turned on the party for not being included in affirmative action policies, and over its inability to prevent attacks on Dalits in Gujarat.

Over the weekend, a riot in the Patan district of Gujarat killed one person and injured 14 others after a fight erupted between Muslim and Hindu school students."
"Mayawati Dares BJP To Hold Polls Using Ballot Papers","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/mayawati-dares-bjp-to-hold-polls-using-ballot-papers-1671770","New Delhi:                             ""If your conscience is so clear, why not call for elections (again) using paper ballot,"". That was  Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati's message to the BJP in the Rajya Sabha, re-iterating her allegation that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) were tampered with in the just concluded Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.  

Ms Mayawati was undeterred as the members from the treasury benches opposed and shouted against her. 

When Congress was in power, senior BJP leaders had expressed apprehensions on the use of EVMs saying free and fair elections cannot happen using the EVMs, she said in Rajya Sabha today.

On Monday, Ms Mayawati said that her party will move court against the alleged tampering. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had rejected her claim that the voting machines were rigged and said her demand for a re-poll using ballot papers was legally untenable.

The former Chief Minister of UP who won just 19 seats in the 403-member House in her state said the results were ""not a verdict of people but a verdict of EVMs."" She said her party has given a notice under rule 267 seeking suspension of business to take up the issue.

She demanded that a law be brought in the on-going budget session of the Parliament to scrap the use of EVMs in future elections.
  
Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien said he would not allow the notice as a short duration discussion on electoral reforms is scheduled tomorrow and these points could be raised then. Ms Mayawati, however, persisted with her point for some time but took her seat after Mr Kurien insisted on not allowing her notice.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too had claimed that EVMs were tampered with in Punjab to keep the Aam Aadmi Party out of power.

""Dal main kuch kaala hain (Something is fishy),"" she said on the BJP's victory, further intensifying the debate surrounding the functioning of electronic voting machines or EVMs.

Ms Banerjee, who heads the Trinamool Congress, claimed that the arithmetic of BJP's victory in Uttar Pradesh does not add up.

""How come, without doing anything and with the negative impact of demonetisation, the BJP got more than 300 seats? There is something wrong and fishy about it. Mayawati has raised doubts about EVMs and I think they still have the opportunity to challenge its functioning in courts,"" said the West Bengal Chief Minister in an interview to ABP Ananda, a local Bengali channel.

She further advised Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati to forge an alliance against the BJP.

In the interview, Ms Banerjee also launched a scathing attack on the BJP, which is looking to expand its footprint in West Bengal. Speaking on the Narada tapes, she accused the centre of conspiring against the Trinamool.

""It is a communal and political conspiracy by the BJP to stop Trinamool Congress from emerging as a contender against it in national politics,"" Ms Banerjee claimed.

Interestingly, the West Bengal Chief Minister admitted that nominating industrialist KD Singh, who is said to have funded the sting, to the Rajya Sabha as a TMC candidate was a mistake.

""I thought he was a man with good credentials. But nominating KD Singh as a Rajya Sabha MP was a mistake. Sometimes, you learn from your mistakes,"" Ms Banerjee said.

Ms Banerjee also claimed that the BJP had approached a leader from her to try and split Trinamool with the promise of making him Chief Minister of West Bengal.

"Life Term For Cow Slaughter In Gujarat, Assembly Clears Tougher Law","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/life-term-for-cow-slaughter-in-gujarat-1675675","Ahmedabad:                             Punishment for cow slaughter in Gujarat will be a life term after an amended law was cleared on the last day of the state assembly session today. Gujarat, where elections will be held later this year, now has the toughest law against cow slaughter in the country.

The Gujarat Animal Preservation Act of 1954 also says the punishment for transporting of cows will be 10 years in jail.

In the current law, which was amended in 2011, the maximum jail term for cow slaughter was seven years. The new law also increases penalty from Rs. 1 lakh to 5 lakh.

The bill was passed in the absence of the opposition Congress, which had walked out on some other subject.

Over the past few weeks, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has often talked about bring in harsher laws to protect cattle. The BJP is committed to protect ""Gau (cow), Ganga and Gita"", he declared earlier this month. This was days after the ruling BJP won giant victories in state elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh, where the party has appointed as Chief Minister the saffron-robed Yogi Adityanath - one of its loudest cow protection campaigners.

Yogi Adityanath has also been invited to campaign in Gujarat, a move that the opposition Congress says indicates a plan to polarize voters.

The slaughter and transport of cows was banned in Gujarat in 2011, when the state was ruled by Narendra Modi, now Prime Minister.

The BJP has governed the PM's home state since 1998. As it seeks a fifth consecutive term this year, it faces the challenge of disenchantment among its former supporters the Patels over quota and anger over attacks on Dalits.

The party's slogan ""UP mein 325, Gujarat mein 150"" (325 seats in UP, 150 in Gujarat) conveys its aim to win Gujarat with a record margin, the sort it won in India's most populous state."
"'Why Should I Resign? I Delivered,' Digvijaya Singh After Sabotage Charge","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/why-should-i-resign-i-delivered-digvijaya-singh-after-sabotage-charge-1670714","NEW DELHI: HighlightsDigvijaya criticised for Congress failing to form Goa government
Take responsibility but I think have done the right thing: Digvijaya
BJP formed Goa government despite winning fewer seats than Congress
                                After a strong rebuttal to his critics within the party, Congress general secretary in-charge of Goa Digvijaya Singh on Friday told NDTV that there was no reason for him to resign for the party's inability to form the government in Goa when he had delivered on his mandate.

""I have delivered the result...Why should I resign?"" Mr Singh told NDTV when asked if he too -like party leaders have been offering to do in other states - would take responsibility for the Congress' failure to get the numbers to form the government in the state under his charge.

The senior Congress leader counted the Aam Aadmi Party's failure to get a single seat and a sharp decline in the BJP's tally from 22 in 2012 elections to 13 seats his achievement. ""We are the single largest party,"" he said.

The Congress won 17 of Goa's 40 assembly seats, just four short of the majority mark. But the BJP, which had just 13 lawmakers moved quickly to tie-up with smaller parties and staked claim to form government, getting an invitation to do so from Governor Mridula Sinha. The Congress says the governor should have first consulted it as the largest party on whether it had the numbers to form government. It has called the invite ""a murder of democracy"" and threatened to move a motion against the Governor in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA is in a minority.

Mr Singh made it clear that he wasn't fighting shy of taking responsibility for everything that happened in Goa but this didn't mean he was wrong.

""I take full responsibility but I think I have done the right thing and I stand by it others... I am not quitting,"" he said.

In a series of tweets earlier in the day, the senior Congress leader had gone public with how the party could have formed the government if his strategy to ally with the Vijay Sardesai-led Goa Forward Party before elections had been implemented. But the move was ""sabotaged"", he said, a reference that opposition from some state leaders to this tie-up. If he had had his way, Mr Singh suggested, the Congress - and not the BJP - would have formed the government.

Mr Singh had also outlined his success in improving the party's tally, something that he believes sets him apart from other leaders heading states where Congress suffered heavy losses.

Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar had offered to step down after the party's dismal performance in the assembly election; the Congress won just seven of the 105 seats contested in UP. In Odisha, the general secretary in-charge of BK Hariprasad made the offer after the Congress ended up with just 60 of the 850 seats in last month's panchayat polls."
"Demonisation, Not Demonetisation That Won In The Assembly Polls: Kapil Sibal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/demonisation-not-demonetisation-that-won-in-the-assembly-polls-kapil-sibal-1674088","New Delhi:                             Targeting the BJP government at the Centre, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Kapil Sibal on Monday said that it is ""demonisation"" and not demonetisation that succeeded (in the recent state assembly elections).

""Don't think demonetisation has succeeded. It is demonisation that has succeeded,"" Mr Sibal said during a discussion on the Finance Bill 2017 in the Rajya Sabha.

Mr Sibal's remarks came immediately after he accused Finance Minister Arun Jaitley of unjustifiably shaming the common people by saying that they evade income tax.

""The Finance Minister in his budget speech made a very passionate appeal and in fact told the people of this country that all of them are dishonest, because they don't pay taxes. He said that out of 125 crore people in this country, only 3.17 crore pay taxes,"" Mr Sibal said.

""But if you calculate, sir, there are just three crore people in this country who are able to pay taxes. And you are telling people that they are dishonest as they don't pay taxes and that's why you are unleashing this terror regime,"" he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8 last year, just months ahead of the assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP has got a thumping majority.

PM Modi had called it a step towards the fight against black money. The BJP also included issues such as Ram temple in Ayodhya, triple talaq and closure of slaughterhouses in its poll pitch.

Taking strong exception to certain amendments moved by the government in the Finance Bill, Mr Sibal said that these provisions seek to give a push to crony capitalism, weaken the federal structure of the country, allow the government to snoop on citizens and instill fear in the business community.

The Congress leader said that the Bill removes the cap on corporate funding to a political party and the new provisions do not require the donor to disclose who it donated to.

""The Bill seeks to amend Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, which requires a company to disclose any donation above Rs. 20,000. The cap of maximum donation of 7.5 per cent of the net profit of a company has also been removed. Now, not even the shareholders would know to which party the money went,"" Mr Sibal argued.

Speaking on Aadhar, he said it was meant only for streamlining the public distribution system, but the present government wants to use it for snooping on the personal lives of citizens.

He said that linking everything to Aadhar entails the risk of all the personal details of an individual being hacked by hackers, apart from the government watching every activity of citizens.

He also objected to the ""unbridled powers"" given to taxmen through an amendment, by which tax officials are not required to give any reason for searching and making seizures, not even to the appellate tribunal."
"MCD Elections 2017: AAP Gives Tickets To Those Who Helped Arvind Kejriwal In Hour Of Need","http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/mcd-elections-2017-aap-gives-tickets-to-those-who-helped-arvind-kejriwal-in-hour-of-need-1673616","New Delhi:                             The Aam Aadmi Party has offered a ticket to contest elections to two people who had helped Arvind Kejriwal during his hour of need. They had offered accommodation to Mr Kejriwal while he struggled to make a foray into the political arena. AAP today, returned the favour by giving them tickets to contest the upcoming municipal or MCD elections, and the assembly by-poll.

62-year-old Naren Jain had offered Mr Kejriwal his house when he had resigned after his first stint as Delhi Chief Minister and was looking for a place where he could stay and host party volunteers. Though Mr Kejriwal could not move into Mr Jain's home due to legal reasons, the AAP today gave him a ticket to contest the MCD elections from Chandni Chowk ward, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.

The other man who helped Mr Kejriwal was 57-year-old Harjeet Singh, who had given his 41, Hanuman Road bungalow to the Aam Aadmi Party during its initial days. Mr Kejriwal took up Mr Singh's offer. In fact, the central Delhi address was used by Mr Kejriwal to file his nomination paper as a Delhi resident during the 2013 Assembly election. Mr Kejriwal is otherwise a resident of Ghaziabad, where he was residing in the government quarters allotted to his wife, formerly with the Income Tax department, at Kaushmabi.

To return the favour, the party has now given Mr Singh a ticket to contest the Rajouri Garden Assembly by-election, where polling will take place on April 9. The seat fell vacant after Jarnail Singh resigned as an Aam Aadmi Party MLA to contest the recent Punjab Assembly polls.

An ardent Kejriwal supporter, Mr Singh is believed to have charged nothing from AAP for using his bungalow. The party office was later shifted to East Patel Nagar. After his resignation as Delhi Chief Minister during his first tenure, Mr Kejriwal had stayed put in his official residence at Tilak Lane. While he planned to vacate the residence, he scouted for an accommodation which could serve not only as a home but also a place where party leaders and volunteers could be hosted. He then zeroed down on 4-B Flagstaff Road, a quiet lane on Alipur Road in north Delhi's Civil Lines area, belonging to Mr Jain, son of former Congress MP from Chandni Chowk Bhiku Ram Jain.

The plan, however, ran into trouble after Mr Jain's elder brother claimed it to be a disputed property and threatened to approach the court. Mr Kejriwal then decided against moving into the accommodation. Now Mr Kejriwal's official residence and the 4-B Flagstaff Road bungalow are separated by just one bungalow. ""I had offered my home to Mr Kejriwal but the Congress played mischief. My intentions behind giving my house to Mr Kejriwal were very noble that could not materialise,"" Mr Jain said."

""I wanted to see the people because of whose hard work the party has got such a massive win,"" the Chief Minister said. The guest list comprised senior ministers in his team and the two Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma.

""Amit Shah told me that tomorrow is the oath-taking ceremony,"" he said at the UP Yoga Mahotsav, adding he left home in Gorakhpur with just two sets of saffron robes that were handy.

At his 5 Kalidas Marg bungalow in the state capital that he had moved into earlier in the day, Yogi Adityanath, however, had a message for the BJP's war horses too. He told them that the massive win had come bundled with big responsibilities. ""Now we will have to stamp out blackmarketeering, dishonesty and corruption in the state,"" he declared.

He also pledged to raise the quality of primary education in the state. The Chief Minister added shoes as one of the facility that young school children should get from the state government, apart from school bags and uniform."

According to the CMS pre-post poll study, more than Rs. 5,500 crore were spent by major political parties in the just-concluded assembly election in Uttar Pradesh (UP) alone.

The Election Commission of India allows Rs. 25 lakh per candidate for campaign expenditure, but it is best known secret that most candidates spend much more than what is officially allowed and what candidates declare after the poll. Campaign activities include a range of conventional and non-conventional activities. Print and electronic material, including wide screen projections, video vans and the like put together itself in this election was put at Rs. 600-900 crore. ""Every vote cast in UP involved a cost of about Rs. 750, which is highest in the country,"" the survey noted.

In the assembly elections, nearly Rs. 200 crore in Uttar Pradesh and over Rs. 100 crore in Punjab were confiscated, the report said, adding that what gets to electoral campaign pipeline is 4-5 times more than what gets confiscated by authorities.""Going by that trend, in 2017, Rs. 1,000 crore were estimated to be distributed among voters,"" it said.

The survey further noted that around 55 per cent voters sampled in Uttar Pradesh knew personally someone or the other in the neighbourhood who had actually taken money for vote in this or earlier assembly polls.

Surprisingly, the study noted that demonetisation has significantly hiked poll expenditure. ""In some constituencies where the fight was tight, the cash involved ranged between Rs. 500 and Rs. 2,000 depending on the number of voters and influencing the role of a voter,"" it said.

Two-thirds of voters found that candidates spent a lot more than ever before. Some of the campaign methods adopted in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections include door-to-door, rallies, yatras, social media, advertising through television, newspapers and multi-screen projections, motor cycle rallies, langar and celebrity shows."
"Astrologers Must Not Predict Results Ahead Of Voting, Says Poll Commission","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/astrologers-must-not-predict-results-ahead-of-voting-says-poll-commission-1675525","New Delhi:                             The ban on surveys predicting election results in the 48-hour period before voting begins will, from now, extend to astrologers, the Election Commission said today. Currently, opinion polls and surveys are also banned from predicting the prospects of various parties before voting, so it does not influence voters.

But today, in a statement, the powerful election body said the prediction of results in ""any form or manner by way of predictions etc. by astrologers, tarot readers, political analysts or by any persons during the prohibited period is a violation"" of the ban that is aimed at making sure voters are not influenced.

There should be no attempts ""merely to score brownie points against competitors for commercial reasons,"" the Election Commission added.

In the absence of opinion polls ahead of the recent round of assembly elections in five states, astrologers and tarot card readers also featured in television debates. Invited to make their predictions, some of them had presented diverse scenarios.

One group of astrologers forecast that the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance would win comfortably in Uttar Pradesh, while others predicted a massive BJP victory. Each side claimed the most accurate results, citing ""authentic analysis of birth charts and horoscopes"".

Pramod Gautam, the chairman of Vedic Sutram, was quoted by IANS as saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ""clearly the winner as his stars continue to be favourable"" and this would favour the BJP. After predicting three BJP wins in the past, Mr Gautam had proved to be correct for the fourth time.

"Narada Case: Man Behind The Sting Operation That Made Mamata Banerjee See Red","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/narada-case-man-behind-the-sting-operation-that-made-mamata-banerjee-see-red-1671998","Kolkata:                             As the CBI probe into the Narada case - which has made Bengal's ruling party see red -- got a green signal from the Supreme Court, the man who conducted the sting operation for a news portal has come under the scanner. Questions have been raised about the motives of Mathew Samuel and his decision to release the tapes in March last year, just before Assembly elections in the state, two years after he had shot them. Who funded the sting that gave away nearly 80 lakh rupees is still a grey area.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court refused to give in to the Bengal government's demand and call off the CBI investigation into the case, which was ordered by the Calcutta High Court on 17 March. The top court has given the agency a month's time to come up with a report in the case, in which leaders of Trinamool were purportedly seen accepting huge wads of cash from the reporter posing as a man wanting to set up a company in Bengal and seeking favours from the government.

Mathew Samuel was a journalist with Tehelka when he conducted the sting operation back in 2014, just before the Lok Sabha elections. At the time, the owner of Tehelka was Trinamool lawmaker KD Singh.
 Questions have been raised about Mathew Samuel's decision to release Narada tapes last yearMr Samuel has reportedly claimed that Mr Singh asked for the sting report.

He has also claimed that at the time, he had no idea that Mr Singh was a lawmaker of the Trinamool Congress. He said he thought Mr Singh belonged to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, a small but powerful regional party from Jharkhand.

The Central Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the case, is investigating Mr Samuel's claims as well.

Mr Singh, who was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in 2010, joined the TMC a few months later. The businessman-turned-politician owns a private jet and a whole range of enterprises like Republic of Chicken, a popular food products outlet, and a chit fund group called Alchemist.

Mr Samuel, however, made the tapes public only in 2016, ahead of the Assembly polls, on a news portal he himself had set up, naradanews.com.  There is no clarity on why he chose that time to make them public.

The agency has searched Mathew Samuel's home in Delhi seeking papers and equipment related to the sting operation.

Mr Samuel, who was last week at a hospital at Kochi, recuperating from surgery, told NDTV that he was cooperating with the investigation. He has also welcomed the Supreme Court order today.

But KD Singh, the lawmaker of TMC, was not available for comment."

"MCD Elections: In Another Big Poll Promise, Arvind Kejriwal Says Will Abolish Residential House Tax","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ahead-of-mcd-polls-arvind-kejriwal-promises-to-abolish-residential-house-tax-1673355","New Delhi:                             Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will abolish the residential house tax and waive-off arrears if voted to power in the capital's civic bodies. His words resonated promises of cutting electricity and water bills  ahead of Delhi assembly elections which AAP swept last year.

Mr Kejriwal said that the house tax has become a ""major"" source of corruption and promised that his AAP, which is making its civic polls debut, will end it.

He vowed to transform the three civic corporations in Delhi - South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) - into ""profit-making"" bodies. NDMC and EDMC are currently grappling with financial losses.

Taking a dig at the ruling BJP, the Chief Minister said its councillors could be seen travelling on scooters before the previous MCD elections, but are now zooming around in expensive cars.

He also promised that the AAP will ensure that municipal staffers get their salaries on time. ""We will abolish the residential house tax and waive off tax arrears if AAP comes to power...the party is preparing its detailed manifesto which will be released soon,"" he told reporters here.

The residential house tax is an important source of revenue for civic bodies. Mr Kejriwal added that the commercial house tax will continue to be in place. To a question on allegations by political rivals that the AAP always announces freebies ahead of the polls, he said the Delhi government is saving money on its projects which is then spent on public welfare.

The three municipal corporations go to polls on April 23, while votes will be counted on April 26."
"Yogi Adityanath's First Speech As UP Chief Minister In Gorakhpur: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-yogi-adityanaths-first-public-speech-as-up-chief-minister-in-gorakhpur-1673436","Yogi Adityanth, who was sworn-in as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister on March 19, addressed his first public meeting as the state's chief. He addressed a rally in Gorakhpur, his hometown, where he returned nearly a week after he was appointed the Chief Minister of India's most populous state. The  BJP came to power in UP with a massive victory on March 11, when the counting of votes took place after a major five-state Assembly elections ended. Large hoardings were put up on the street in Gorakhpur for his grand welcome. Before the public function, Mr Adityanath had met his supporters, and later, district officials. The state's former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today took a jibe on the 44-year-old leader, saying ""The Chief Minister has said he is one year older than me. I say you (Adityanath) may be older in age but are far behind in terms of work."" This was Mr Yadav's retort to Mr Adityanath's jab in Lok Sabha earlier this week.

Here are the live updates of Yogi Adityanath's speech:I am thankful to the 22 crore people of UP who gave the BJP, on the insistence of the world's most popular politician PM Modi and Amit Shah, a chance to form the government.PM Modi's development programmes are being made available to all the citizens. He has entrusted me with the responsibility to make the dreams of the state true.Brain drain was a problem, businessmen were moving out, women and anganwadi workers continue their protests.PM Modi was worried how to fix things in UP, how to develop this huge state.He had laid foundation for a fertilizer company and AIIMS hospital. Now we are confident that the population of the state will not feel left out.Amit Shah has been instrumental in making the BJP the world's most important political party and popular in UP. The result is in front of us.It's not just a position for me, we are also responsible for the well-being of the state and its populace.I would request you all to thank the BJP leadership, PM Modi and hardworking members for this landslide victory.Sabka saath and sabka vikas ki raah pe chalenge.I promise and will ensure there would be no discrimination based on caste, creed or colour community.PM wants that every citizen must benefit from the schemes of the government. We all are just representatives to realise his dream.I might not be available in Gorakhpur as much as I would want to, but a solution would be provided for all the problems.We would dedicate ourselves to the service of the state.No new decisions will be taken which were not mentioned in the manifesto.We will fulfil all our promises.UP will be turned into a developed state.We need your support to make that happen.We are devoted to the state, there would be no corruption.Goondaraaj will end and there will be no place for lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh. For this, Gorakhpur has been a laboratory for such work where crime was brought down. This model will be emulated in the rest of the state. Under PM Modi's leadership, we will develop the state.We will keep coming back to you asking for your support and feedback.Safety will be guaranteed, we want your blessings and support.I am one of you and I will work for all the parts of UP, not just Gorakhpur or eastern UP.Your support will be my strength to ensure law and order, safety.Josh mein hosh na khone ki stithi aani nahi chahiye.We have formed anti-romeo sqauds destructive minds, eve-teasers will be dealt with"
"BSP Chief Mayawati To Move Court This Week Against EVM 'Tampering' In UP Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bsp-chief-mayawati-to-move-court-this-week-against-evm-tampering-in-up-polls-1671417","New Delhi:                             The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will move court in the next two-three days against the alleged tampering of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, its chief Mayawati today said. She charged that ""the BJP won elections by rigging electronic voting machines"".

Ms Mayawati had said that a 'black day' will be observed every month against what she termed the ""murder of democracy"" by the BJP.

""We will approach court over the issue in the next two-three days,"" the BSP supremo told reporters in the Parliament premises. Earlier, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had rejected Mayawati's claim that the voting machines were rigged and said her demand for a re-poll using ballot papers was legally untenable.

The BSP, which had 80 legislators in the outgoing UP Assembly, managed to win just 19 seats in the 403-member House. Driven by the Modi wave, the BJP, along with its ally, had stormed to power in UP after 14 years, securing 325 seats, while the Samajwadi Party had won 47 seats and its ally the Congress seven seats.

The former Chief Minister of UP had alleged large-scale tampering in the EVMs soon after results were announced on March 11.The Samajwadi Party and the Congress had also supported Mayawati's allegations.The BJP had ridiculed Ms Mayawati's allegations of EVM tampering and asked her to ""gracefully accept the people's mandate"".

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too had claimed that EVMs were tampered with in Punjab to keep the Aam Aadmi Party out of power."

"UP Election Results 2017 - Akhilesh Yadav's Unforced Errors Will Impact His Clout vs Father Mulayam","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-results-2017-akhilesh-yadav-and-rahul-gandhi-friends-with-absolutely-no-benefits-1668650","New Delhi: HighlightsAkhilesh Yadav and Congress alliance no match for PM Modi
Father Mulayam had warned against partnering with Rahul Gandhi
Congress in Uttar Pradesh headed for less than 10 seats
                                It turns out that Akhilesh Yadav's big decisions in his attempt to stretch his political legs and stride away from his father have backfired spectacularly. The 44-year-old Chief Minister today earned the distinction of being vanquished in the BJP's biggest ever result in India's most important state. Of 403 seats, the BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is placed to win 325. Akhilesh Yadav, on the other hand, had accrued 47, with his junior partner, the Congress, proving party pooper by adding just another seven.

""I guess the new government will provide better expressways, maybe people didn't like the freeways we built, and now a bullet train will be brought for UP,"" said Akhilesh Yadav in a press conference at his residence, appearing relaxed but not abjuring sarcasm. Mayawati, who was relegated to third place, has alleged that the voting machines in UP were rigged, raising feedback of the sore loser variety. ""If a complaint has been raised, the government should look into it. I will also study this,"" he said.

He is not short of material to scrutinize. Whether entwining with the Congress was an unforced error is arguable. Akhilesh Yadav said recently that the alliance was formed when he was operating from a position of weakness, trapped in a long and public fight with his father, Mulayam Singh, for control of the Samajwadi Party. Mulayam Singh, 77, was categorical that a collaboration with any party, including the Congress, was unacceptable. Akhilesh Yadav felt differently. At a time when his party was riven by his family feud, he felt that the Congress would help consolidate the crucial Muslim vote, which accounts for 18 per cent of the population and serve as a beta blocker for the momentum generated by PM Modi.  

Oops.  

Not only did the Congress fail to pull its own weight, but it also served as an ankle-weight for Samajwadi candidates, who say the Congress' votes did not transfer to them.
 UP Election Results 2017: Akhilesh Yadav earned the distinction of being vanquished in the stateApart from counter-pointing his father, Akhilesh Yadav's predisposition to combining with the Congress was based on his famed friendship with Rahul Gandhi, who is three years older than him and is his party's No 2. Mother and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi left election decisions to him and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was credited publicly by the party for salvaging the alliance from busting over how many seats the Congress would be allotted. It got 105, vastly disproportionate to both its result in the last election in 2012 and its depleted stature since. As exit polls on Thursday forecast a BJP win (though only two correctly called an outright landslide), Akhilesh Yadav said, in a reversal of stand, that should the need arise, he was open to seeking an alliance with Mayawati.

The Samajwadi-Congress combine came to be etched too firmly in voters' minds as narrowly focused on the Muslims and the Yadavs and drove a consolidation of the Hindu vote for the BJP.

A month-long Kisan Yatra in September, which saw him touring the state uninterrupted, followed by joint road-shows with Akhilesh Yadav in an open-top Mercedes SUV, did not improve Rahul Gandhi's ability to connect with people or to draw mass support for the Congress. Despite that, his party has not swerved from a long tradition of sycophancy, with senior leader Digvijaya Singh today stating that ""It is not possible for Rahul Gandhi to step down. The Gandhi-Nehru family is the biggest binding factor for the Congress.""
 Akhilesh Yadav's predisposition to combining with Congress was based on his friendship with Rahul GandhiEarly this morning, before the counting of votes began, Samajwadi Party workers held a hawan to incite a victory. By then, a life-size cutout of Rahul Gandhi that had for days been placed alongside a similar representation of Akhilesh Yadav had been removed overnight. Either the cadre was venting its anger, or it was taking no chances with what it considers bad luck. Either way, it did not augur well for the Chief Minister.

Apart from the ruinous alliance with the Congress, Akhilesh Yadav will now have to inquest his decision to thrust his father into an adjunct role so close to the election. He had spoken of returning the post of President, which he hijacked with the support of thousands of party delegates, to Mulayam Singh after the election was completed. His stock within the party, so greatly enlarged during his feud with his father, with him being read as the clean, young politician trying to purge over-the-hill leaders unhesitant about mingling with criminals and dons, if needed for political gain, has taken a big hit.

""Our cycle was tubeless,"" he joked this evening of his party symbol, ""it proved impossible to pump air into its wheels"" - a bantering assessment of the damage caused by his fractious relationship with his father.

Though he himself did not shy away from promoting candidates like Gayatri Prajapati, named in multiple criminal cases including one of gang-rape, for the most part, Akhilesh Yadav enjoys public goodwill. His development of world-class highways, his focus on education for the youth is not unappreciated by the public. But it turned out to be a wimpy opponent to the currently unassailable popularity of PM Modi and his credibility as a driver of change and progress. The bicycle wobbled. His father now has a chance to advocate that's what happens when training wheels are removed too quickly."
"In Manipur, Small Parties Hold The Key To Government Formation","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-manipur-small-parties-hold-the-key-to-government-formation-1668848","Imphal:                             The National People's Party (NPP), a regional party founded by former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma will get to play king maker after the Congress and the BJP failed to get a majority in the Manipur assembly elections, results of which were announced yesterday. Largest party, the Congress, has 28 seats, three short of the 31 needed to form government in the state. The BJP has 21 and has ten short, but has made it clear it will give getting allies on board a shot.

The NNP's Conrad Sangma told NDTV today that the party's new legislators will decide by Sunday evening who they will support. ""We have fought the election alone, so we can take decision alone. Let us not discuss here, as we said let our meeting get over,"" he said, adding with a smile, ""this is a not the Congress"".

The NNP has won 4 seats in the assembly elections -- is already part of the North East Democratic Alliance or NEDA -- a front organization of anti-Congress parties stitched together by BJP chief Amit Shah after the party's victory in the Assam assembly elections last year.  So is the Naga People's Front, which won another four seats. The party, which has been livid over the Congress government's decision to carve out seven new districts -- which it says compromises the tribal lands and identity of the Nagas -- has indicated that it will support a non-Congress government.

Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, which won one seat in Manipur, is already an ally of the BJP. Mr Paswan has said his party will support the BJP in Manipur. The seat that hangs in balance has been won by an Independent.

The Congress' Okram Ibobi Singh has been Manipur's Chief Minister for 15 years straight. This time the BJP challenged him in its bid to win another state in the north east and inducted and fielded top rebels of the Congress.

On Saturday, results were announced for elections in five states. The BJP has won Uttar Pradesh by a landslide and has also swept the hill state of Uttarakhand. It is the second largest party in both Manipur and Goa, but party chief Amit Shah made it clear in his victory speech that the BJP will attempt to form government in both states."
"Punjab Election Results 2017: Just 6 Women Make It To Assembly","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-results-just-6-women-make-it-to-assembly-1668866","Chandigarh:                             Only six of the 81 contesting women candidates managed to secure a place in the 117-member Punjab Assembly. The winning candidates, three from the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) each, marked merely 5 per cent of the Assembly's strength.

Among the winners are AAP's Rupinder Kaur, who won Bathinda rural seat, Sarvjit Kaur (Jagraon) and Prof Baljinder Kaur (Talwandi Sabo) and Congress's Aruna Chaudhary (Dinanagar), Satkar Kaur (Ferozepur rural) and Razia Sultana (Malerkotla).

Among women leaders, Aruna Chaudhary won by the highest margin of 31,917 votes and Rubinder Kaur Rubu emerged victorious with the lowest vote (10,778) difference.

In the 2012 assembly polls, 14 out of the 93 nominees had made it to the House.

BSP candidate Mumtaz, a transgender, contested the elections from Buchho Mandi in Bathinda district, but lost by 1,137 votes. 

On Saturday, the Congress upturned the SAD-BJP alliance in the polls by ending 10-year regime of the Badal family. The Congress in Punjab, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, is set to return to power after a gap of a decade, decimating on its way the ruling Akalis and dashing the hopes of newbie Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The Congress won 77 seats in the 117-member Punjab Assembly. Prominent among them is Navjot Singh Sidhu, who quit the BJP to join the Congress before the elections and contested from Amritsar East. The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, which many expected to win the state, managed to bag just 23 seats. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance won merely 18 seats.

Amarinder Singh winning in stronghold Patiala, trailing in Lambi
He had announced that if he lost, it would be his last electionCaptain Amarinder Singh could not have hoped for a better 75th birthday. His party, the Congress, is making a comeback in Punjab after 10 years and he is expected to return as Chief Minister.

The Congress is set to win a huge majority in Punjab. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of Arvind Kejriwal, which had been tipped by many as the winner, is a poor second and the ruling Akali-BJP is last.

""Arvind Kejriwal is a summer storm, he came and he's gone,"" Amarinder Singh quipped about the man who had repeatedly challenged him during the campaign.

As for his party's victory, Amarinder Singh graciously credited Sonia Gandhi, who did not campaign at all, and Rahul Gandhi, who reserved much of his energies for Uttar Pradesh.

Popular as ""Captain"" among his supporters, Mr Singh had declared that this is his last election.

He said his first priority would be to fight drugs; Punjab's drug problem was depicted in the acclaimed movie ""Udta Punjab"" recently.

""The people of Punjab have given us a big mandate. I have vowed to finish drugs within four weeks,"" the Captain said.

He was non-committal on having the flamboyant cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu as his deputy.

""That will be decided by the Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi. All ministers will be decided by the party leadership,"" he said.

The Captain has not shared the warmest of ties with Mr Sidhu, who joined the Congress in January amid speculation that he was angling for the Chief Minister's post.

Mr Singh contested two seats. He has won his traditional stronghold of Patiala, but in Lambi, where he challenged Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal, he is trailing."
"SAD will review Punjab election outcome, says Parkash Singh Badal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sad-will-review-punjab-election-outcome-says-parkash-singh-badal-1668947","Chandigarh:                             The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will hold a meeting to review the party's performance in the Punjab assembly elections, said the outgoing Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal today. 

Congratulating the Congress on its victory, Mr Badal said that his party will support the new government if it works in the interest of the people and the state. The Congress, which bagged 77 of the state's 117-member Assembly seats, decimated the Akali-BJP combine, who won just 18 seats.

""We will call a meeting of the party in which we will discuss the reasons (behind the defeat in the polls),"" he told reporters after submitting his resignation to Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore in Chandigarh.

On the Sutlej-Yamuna-Link canal issue, he said that ""not single drop of water"" will be shared, as Punjab's economy depends on it. 

Responding to a question on the Congress's resolve to wipe out drug menace from the state in four weeks, the outgoing Chief Minister said, ""Whatever steps they take will come before you"". 

""The kind of development work we undertook, has never happened in the state. But if there was any deficiency or wrong propaganda launched against us, we will analyse these and then take corrective measures,"" said SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal.

He said that the SAD-BJP alliance lost the elections due to a drop in the vote share. The alliance received a 31 per cent vote share while the Congress and the AAP got 38 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, he added.

Sukhbir Singh Badal congratulated Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh on his win and said that the party will ""watch"" the new government closely.

"Punjab Election Results 2017: List Of Winning Candidates","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-results-2017-list-of-winning-candidates-1668726","New Delhi:                             The Congress in Punjab, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, is set to return to power after a gap of a decade, decimating on its way the ruling Akalis and dashing the hopes of newbie Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

Congress' candidates have won or are leading in 76 seats in the 117-member Punjab Assembly. Prominent among them is Navjot Singh Sidhu, who quit the BJP to join the Congress before the elections and contested from Amritsar East. He credited his victory to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, which many expected to win the state, managed to bag just 23 seats, but scored better than the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance, which has won only 18 seats.

Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal has won the Jalalabad assembly seat with a margin of 18,500 votes defeating AAP's Punjab poster boy Bhagwant Mann.

Congress' Amarinder Singh, who will be Chief Minister, won the Patiala seat - his home turf - defeating AAP's Balbir Singh by a massive 52,407 votes. But he lost, Lambi, the other seat he contested to outgoing chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.

The other big winner from the Congress is Badal family rebel Manpreet Singh Badal from Bathinda Urban, bagging 63,942 votes.

Mr Kejriwal and his wife skipped their daily morning walk today and stayed home to watch the assembly elections results on television. The area outside the Aam Aadmi Party chief's Delhi home was decorated with hundreds of saffron, white and green balloons. A huge LED screen showed leads as they came in. Bollywood music composer AR Rahman's popular hit anthem Jai Ho blared from loud speakers. The chief minister - who spent weeks away from Delhi to campaign mostly in Punjab and also in Goa - was, it was clear, preparing for victories in both states.Within two hours, however, the scene was drastically different. Complete silence. AAP has come in a distant second in Punjab and has failed to open its account in Goa. Not a single seat yet.

In the words of Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh, he was a ""summer storm, he came and he's gone.""
 Twitter was quick to troll Mr Kejriwal.

1. Literally everyone made the same joke:
2. People couldn't stop tweeting this picture showing banners printed clearly anticipating a very different result
 
3. Someone imagined AAP supporters watching the results unfold
 
4. Another imagined how Mr Kejriwal might stop people from tuning in
 
5. Someone wondered how PM Modi might console the Delhi Chief Minister
 
6. Another wondered what Mr Kejriwal might do next
 
7. Some hoped Mr Kejriwal would focus on his 'big' promise for the capital
 
8. Music director and AAP supporter Vishal Dadlani had some sensible advice
 
9. But Anand Mahindra reminded everyone what was really important
 
The question on everyone's mind now: AAP ka kya hoga? Let us know what you think in the comments section below."

                                        Uttar Pradesh elections results 2017 is all set to declare BJP's landslide victory and PM Modi's super wave has ensured a majority government in the 403-seat state. BJP won 312 of the state's 403 seats; its allies have won 13 seats for a grand total of 325. The Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance has taken a bashing at the hands of the challenger. Mayawati's BSP, which was being considered the dark horse in the elections, has failed to surprise and is at a distant third position. The BJP in the crucial assembly elections, billed as a semi-final before the 2019 national elections, has surprised the pollsters and has delivered one of its best performance in UP in decades.

Today's results will also be seen as a referendum for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's notes ban last year. PM Modi was the face of the BJP's campaign with the party choosing not to project a chief ministerial candidate and seeking votes for PM Modi's policies and development agenda.

Ruling Samajwadi Party's gamble, under Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, to partner with the Congress, spearheaded by its vice president Rahul Gandhi fell flat today.  Both parties had to face a drubbing at the hands of PM Modi-led BJP.

"Punjab Election Results 2017: As Votes Are Counted In Punjab, Congresss Amarinder Singh Turns 75","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-to-turn-75-on-poll-result-day-1668491","Chandigarh:                             Congress leader and former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh will turn 75 today, the day when the results of Punjab Assembly elections, which witnessed an intense triangular contest, will be declared.

It remains to be seen what gift is in store for the state Congress chief tomorrow, who has already announced that this was his last election.

If the Congress, which is seeking to return to power in Punjab after a hiatus of 10 years, wins, he would have two reasons to cheer.

 While the Congress veteran has been spending the last few days at his residence in Chandigarh, his hectic poll campaign schedule was followed by the release of his biography -- The People's Maharaja -- written by Chandigarh-based journalist Khushwant Singh.

Earlier this month, Amarinder had also attended the wedding of his grandson, Nirvan Singh, in Delhi.

Nirvan, a scion of the erstwhile Patiala royal family, tied the nuptial knot with Mriganka Singh, granddaughter of senior Congress leader Karan Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP and scion of Jammu and Kashmir's princely family.

The Punjab Congress chief contested from two seats, his traditional stronghold of Patiala, where he took on former Army Chief Gen. J J Singh (retd) and in Lambi against Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal."
"UP Election Results 2017: 'If You Were Rahul Gandhi, Would You Quit?' Sandeep Dikshit Responded....","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-results-2017-if-you-were-rahul-gandhi-would-you-quit-sandeep-dikshit-responded-1668587","New Delhi: HighlightsSandeep Dikshit says Congress does not build, back leaders
Is Rahul Gandhi mass leader? 'Will reserve judgement,' he said
Congress must introspect openly, that will help leaders: Dikshit
                                Sandeep Dikshit's willingness to call it like it has made him an outlier within the Congress, which picked his mother, 74-year-old Sheila Dikshit, as its candidate for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, before it allied with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. On Saturday, as the Congress was reduced to roadkill by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top-gear win in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Dikshit outlined the party's infirmities. Unlike the BJP, he said, the Congress does not invest in building leaders or backing them. He contrasted this with the BJP's early support for Mr Modi, which, he said, remained intact despite the allegations that as Chief Minister of Gujarat, he did not do enough to stop the communal riots in 2002 that seared the state, a charge rejected by the Supreme Court. ""We don't have a system to build and stand behind a leader. 2002-Modi-BJP is a great example. Modi was actually a liability for the BJP...but they stuck by Modi, gave him an opportunity, and see where he has gone,"" he said.

Mr Dikshit, 52, spoke to NDTV as it became clear that the Congress' defeat in Uttar Pradesh - despite an alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - boldfaces what the party insists on denying - that it is in the midst of its worst crisis in decades. Under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, who led the campaign against the PM in 2014, the Congress has racked up a series of huge losses. ""Would you step down now if you were Rahul Gandhi?"" NDTV's Prannoy Roy asked Mr Dikshit. Substantial pause, then - ""I'm not Rahul Gandhi.""

Mr Dikshit prefaced his comments with the acknowledgement that they are likely to irk the Congress, which brooks no argument of the quality of its Gandhi leadership. When asked if Mr Gandhi is a mass leader (all evidence suggests otherwise), he held his silence, for a bit, leaned forward, and then said, ""Can we use this election to read that? I don't know. I think I'll still reserve (my) judgement.""

Like other Congress leaders including Abhishek Manu Singhvi who appeared on NDTV today, Mr Dikshit said that it would be unfair to blame the party's debacle in India's prize state entirely on Mr Gandhi. He said the party's culture has become one of ""First, let's capture the Congress, (then) Congress will capture the votes,"" arguing that there is too much internal competition for party positions and that party managers have become more prominent and powerful than leaders with potential as vote-getters (he refused to say who this category includes within this Congress). He also said that if the Congress chooses- as it often has- to conjure a silver lining today, it will have missed the point.

The coalition managed to win just 56 of the states 403 seats while the BJP and allies, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, scored a landslide win by claiming 325.

""No one is responsible (for the loss). We failed to convince the voters. Uttar Pradesh voted for BJP because of the promises they made. Let's see if they can fulfil the promises. We have lost earlier too, but then formed a government,"" he said.

Samajwadi Party's campaign for the polls was marked by in-fighting between two camps of the party led by Mulayam Singh and his son Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. Voices within the party have also blamed a late alliance with the Congress, opposed  by Mulayam Singh but commissioned by Akhilesh.

Akhilesh Yadav, who wrested control of the party from his father amid a bitter power tussle just weeks ahead of the polls, met party workers and leaders today, saying that the Samajwadi Party was not only a party, but an ideology, and that their ""struggle will continue.""

""You all should reach out to people and strengthen the party again. I will review party's performance and analyse the results. A meeting of all the party candidates and MLAs will be held next week after which we will devise our new strategy,"" he said."

The board will also work on the strategy for Goa and Manipur, where the Bharatiya Janata Party has propelled itself in the game of government formation, even though it has failed to get majority. The party is likely to announce the chief ministers only after Holi.

In UP, where the BJP+ has won 325 of 403 seats, Dinesh Sharma, who had charge of the BJP's membership drive in India, is said to be one of the front runners for the chief minister's post after the party's massive win on Saturday. Union minsters Manoj Sinha, Mahesh Sharma and senior BJP leader Sidharth Nath Singh are also said to be in the race.

In Uttarakhand, according to the BJP sources, possible chief ministerial candidates are Satpal Maharaj, a spiritual guru who left the Congress to join the BJP, Trivendra Singh Rawat and Prakash Pant.
 Amit Shah said election results prove that PM Modi is the most popular leader since IndependenceBJP chief Amit Shah, delivering his victory speech at the party's headquarters in Delhi on Saturday said election results prove that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the most popular leader since Independence.

""The results are very encouraging for the BJP, we are going to form government in four states - UP, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur,"" the BJP chief said, thanking voters and party workers in all five states where assembly elections were held.

He said the results were a victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the mandate would ""take the country's politics in a new direction.""      

PM Modi turned the UP contest into a test of his personal popularity and his radical notes ban to eliminate black money. The party's performance in assembly elections is seen as an endorsement of his high-risk decision last November to scrap high denomination 500 and 1,000 rupee notes.

The BJP, along with allies have left  less than a 100 seats to be shared by all other parties."

He said the battle for Punjab was for 'Congress's identity and honour'
Congress is set to make a comeback in Punjab after 10 years
                                Navjot Singh Sidhu today credited his victory and his Congress party's big win in Punjab to state chief Captain Amarinder Singh, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, and launched into his characteristic stream of quotable quotes. ""I promise to Sonia Gandhi that we will sacrifice anything to restore the glory of Punjab,"" the cricketer-turned-politician told reporters.

Describing the Punjab contest as a battle for ""Congress's identity and its Pagdi (honour)"", he touched his own bright yellow pagdi or turban.

""This is the revival of the Congress. It is a beginning. The Congress will revive from here. The party will take strength from here and spread across the country,"" he added.

 The Congress has returned to power in Punjab with a huge majority, winning 77 seats in the 117 member assembly. The Akali-BJP combine, which was in power for 10 years, was reduced to number three, after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which won 22 seats.

Mr Sidhu, a former BJP MP, won the assembly election from the Amritsar-east constituency by a margin of 42,409 votes against his BJP and AAP rivals.

The popular commentator joined the Congress just days ahead of the February polls in the state and was a star campaigner along with Captain Amarinder Singh, who headed the party's campaign.

AAP was Mr Sidhu's original destination after he quit the BJP in September, upset about being sidelined and denied his Amritsar seat in the 2014 election. Mr Sidhu briefly headed his political front 'Avaaz-e-Punjab', a non-starter, before turning his focus to the Congress.

""Arvind Kejriwal lost because his niyat (intention) was not pure. He wanted everything for himself,"" Mr Sidhu said, taking a dig at the AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister, whose party suffered defeats both in Punjab and Goa.

Congress leaders spoke about a significant role for Mr Sidhu in the new government, but Amarinder Singh was non-committal, saying any such decision will be taken by Rahul Gandhi."
"With 90 Votes After 16-Year Struggle, Irom Sharmila Bows Out Of Politics","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-90-votes-after-16-year-struggle-irom-sharmila-bows-out-of-politics-1668744","Thoubal:                             Hours after Thoubal handed her just 90 votes, Manipur's Iron Lady Irom Sharmila - who conducted a 16-year hunger strike demanding the withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA --- said she would quit active politics and travel south to ""calm"" her mind. Barely 24 hours ago, the feisty activist had said she would ""try again"" in the national elections of 2019 if she lost her contest against Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh in Thoubal.

Ms Sharmila, 44, had stopped her fast last August, saying she wished to chart a new course for the agitation as the Chief Minister of the state. She also said that she wanted to get married.  It had enraged a section of the people, who had unleashed a barrage of criticism. But undeterred, she had started a new political party - the PRJA (Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance) - and held strategy sessions with political leaders including Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal.

She had even waded into a controversy, claiming that the BJP had offered her a ticket and a hefty fund for her campaign. She said she had refused.

Cash-strapped despite crowd-funding, the members of the fledgling party had campaigned on cycles. At the end of it, Ms Sharmila polled just 90 votes from Thoubal. Her opponent, three-time Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, won comfortably with a margin of 10,740 votes. Two of her party members also lost their security deposits of Rs. 10,000 each - which happens only when one fails to poll 10 per cent of the valid votes.  

Later, the activist sounded despondent. ""I am fed up with this political system. I have decided to quit active politics. I will move to south India as I need to calm my mind,"" she said.  She however, made it clear that it was not the end of her agitation against AFSPA.  ""I will continue my fight against AFSPA until and unless it is repealed. But I will fight as a social activist,"" she said.

Twitter, though, was outraged on her behalf, with many pointing out how she had deserved better."

Exit polls show BJP likely to win Uttar Pradesh
Rahul Gandhi removed from publicity material at Akhilesh's office
                                A life-size cut-out of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been replaced overnight at the Samajwadi Party office in Lucknow. His replacement? Mulayam Singh, the party's 77-year-old founder, whose son Akhilesh Yadav is running for a second consecutive term as Chief Minister.

His insistence on allying with the Congress was one of the reasons for an epic war between Akhilesh Yadav and his father that placed their party dangerously close to splitting ahead of the election in Uttar Pradesh, seen as a bellwether for the national election of 2019.

They managed to reconcile- just about- in time for the campaign, and the Chief Minister conducted some public meetings accompanied by Rahul Gandhi, the 46-year-old Vice President of the Congress.

At the Samajwadi Party office, slogans that bound the two young leaders together have also disappeared.

Exit polls show the BJP ahead of the competition, some give it a strong majority, the poll of exit polls (an aggregate) gives the party 211 of 403 seats.

As the forecasts were broadcast, Akhilesh Yadav said that he was open to a new partnership with rival Mayawati, whom he displaced as Chief Minister in 2012. She has not commented on his revelation, but the BJP described it as a sign of the Samajwadi Party's ""desperation.""

The Congress, which has sequentially lost key states since the general election of 2014, has been reduced to a bit player in Uttar Pradesh; the collaboration with the Samajwadi Party which made it a junior partner helped rescue it from the sidelines to some extent."

Exit polls had predicted Congress and AAP neck in neck for top spot
AAP fails to open account in Goa
                                The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) began its day with celebrations that were not meant to be. The tricolour balloons and AR Rahman's ""Jai Ho"" blaring on loudspeakers outside chief Arvind Kejriwal's home in Delhi vanished two hours into the counting of votes for five states including Punjab and Goa, where AAP had anticipated victories. AAP workers were seen dumping brooms - the party's symbol - into the backseat of a car.

The party is at second place in Punjab and has lost every seat in Goa, where it was expecting a big bang debut.

Where it had said it would win 100 of 117 seats, AAP was struggling to cross even 22 after hours of counting.

Mr Kejriwal tweeted, ""We accept people's mandate. All volunteers worked hard. Our struggle will continue.""

By the second hour of counting of votes in five states, it was clear that AAP was done for in Punjab, the state it had hoped to rule. It was third in vote share and its biggest faces - Bhagwant Mann and Gurpreet Singh Ghuggi - lost. In Goa, it has polled only six per cent of the votes, compared t0 32 and 28 per cent for the BJP and Congress. AAP's chief ministerial candidate Elvis Gomes emerged fourth in his seat.
 AAP workers dump jhadoos after crushing disappointment in Punjab, Goa.""Today's results will set the tone for the future politics in India. It's a historic day,"" tweeted AAP leader Ashutosh in the morning. He hasn't tweeted since but told reporters, ""We are disappointed with the results. We will introspect, but for a new party, even second place is big.""

The party's national dreams have been stalled, for now. The focus, say AAP leaders, will now shift to the Delhi municipal polls.

In Punjab, where he addressed nearly 100 rallies, Mr Kejriwal was dismissed as a ""summer storm that came and went"" by Captain Amarinder Singh of the Congress, the man set to be Chief Minister.

Kumar Vishwas, asked whether the failure reflected on Mr Kejriwal, said, ""All elections are fought in his name, this doesn't mean anything on him personally.""

The party said Punjab and Goa would be a ""great learning experience"" on what went wrong for the party.

Two years ago, AAP had scored a sensational victory in Delhi, decimating rivals BJP and Congress. It also debuted in parliament by winning four seats in Punjab in 2014 - the equivalent of 33 seats."
"'Exit Polls Underestimate Us, Will Get Over 300 Seats': BJP's UP President","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exit-polls-underestimate-us-will-get-over-300-seats-bjps-up-president-1668499","Lucknow: HighlightsBJP will cross majority mark, get over 300 seats: Keshav Prasad Maurya
Mr Maurya said public support for PM Modi cuts across castes
Exit polls have predicted BJP getting 211 of 403 seats in the assembly
                                The BJP's performance in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections will exceed the simple majority predicted by exit polls and hover around the 300 mark, the party's state party chief Keshav Prasad Maurya told NDTV on Friday, hours before counting of votes for the 403-seat assembly begins.

Mr Maurya said the broad-based public support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi across castes that had delivered a landslide 71 out of 80 seats in India's most populous state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was intact, and would not only be repeated in 2017 assembly elections but in the 2019 general elections too.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he said, conceded defeat when he started talking about tying up with the BSP's Mayawati. ""The BJP believes he can tie up with his aunt, friend Rahul (Gandhi)... with whoever he wants. But the BJP is going to get such big numbers that the BSP and SP are going to be uprooted,"" he said. And you don't need to wait all day for the results. He said the message from the people will be clear by 11 a.m.

An aggregate of the poll of exit polls suggests that the BJP - which contested the election against the BSP led by Mayawati and the SP-Congress combine under Akhilesh Yadav's leadership without a chief ministerial face - has a clear edge in Uttar Pradesh.

The state BJP president said his confidence didn't stem from the exit poll results but on the strength of the party's 1.4 lakh polling booth-level committees and the hard work put in by party workers over the last 10 months. The Lok Sabha member from the Phulpur seat - that was once represented by Jawaharlal Nehru - was elevated as state party unit chief in April last year, a surprise decision that was calculated to reach out to non-Yadav OBCs in the state.

It is a strategy that some experts believe may have delivered dividends for the BJP. Mr Maurya insists the appeal of PM Modi - who he called the messiah of the poor - cuts across caste divisions by the SP, BSP and the Congress."

Briefing them about the election guidelines, the meeting discussed the implementation of the model code of conduct, scrutinising advertisement by political parties, media monitoring, expenditure monitoring, maintenance of shadow observation register and permission for conduct of public rallies, an official spokesman said today.

Asking the political parties to cooperate with state administration to ensure free and fair elections, Mr Lone advised the parties to avoid defamatory personal remarks or provocative statements, which could initiate an official enquiry. 

Stressing on strict implementation of the election panel guidelines, he asked contesting candidates to open separate bank accounts for election expenditure. The meeting also discussed the designation of polling stations and participants were asked to file objections, if any, by March 13.

On March 9, the Election Commission (EC) announced the schedule for by-elections to three parliamentary and 12 assembly constituencies.

By-polls to Srinagar and Anantnag Lok Sabha constituencies in Kashmir would be held on April 9 and 12, respectively.

The Anantnag seat fell vacant in June last after Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti won the assembly elections and resigned from the Lok Sabha.

The Srinagar Lok Sabha seat was vacated by former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Tariq Hamid Karra who had resigned in protest against alleged ""brutalities"" on protesters in the Valley.

By-polls in Radhakrishnan Nagar, Tamil Nadu, which fell vacant after the demise of then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa will also be held on 12 April.

He had also been the state president of the party till he was replaced ahead of the assembly elections by Keshav Pradhan Maurya.

Early leads have showed that the BJP is heading for a massive victory in Uttar Pradesh. If the trends continue, the party may win more than 250 of the state's 403 seats in an election that's billed as the dress rehearsal for the 2019 general elections. Currently it is ahead in 238 of the 340 seats for which leads have come in.

In Uttarakhand too, the BJP is leading in 52 seats -- a gain of 24 from the last time. In the 70-member assembly, a party needs 36 seats to form the government.

Celebrations have started at the BJP headquarters after the early trends made its lead in the two states clear. The party is also expecting good news from Goa, where it is neck and neck with the Congress.

""The BJP has emerged as the most inclusive party and inspired the voters to rise above the traditional feudal mindset of parties in the state. With kind of support he enjoys, PM Modi has become a rallying point for the party across the country,"" said Union Minister Jitendra Singh.

The only state where it is trailing is Punjab, where the Congress is so far in the leading, with Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party at its heels."

The party won 17 seats, and the BJP trailed with 13 in the 40-member assembly. Nine seats went to the others - three for the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP, three for the Goa Forward Party and 3 Independents - who will hold the key to government formation in the state.

The MGP -- which is part of an alliance with the Shiv Sena and the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM -- had broken its alliance with the BJP in January. The Shiv Sena, whose chief Uddhav Thackeray said he would not enter any alliance with the BJP again.

Exit polls had predicted that the BJP could retain Goa. Three out of four exit polls did not rule out a majority for the party and only one predicted a hung house. The aggregate gave the BJP 18 of the state's 40 seats.

But by the afternoon, the party's setback became apparent. BJP Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost to Congress rival Dayanand Sopte from Goa's Mandrem constituency.

Party chief Amit Shah, however, said, ""The results are very encouraging for the BJP, we are going to form government in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur"".

The Congress government of Digambar Kamat had lost the state in 2012 -- trailing the BJP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party combine with only nine seats. The BJP had won 21 seats and the MGP three, which added up to a comfortable majority.

Today, Mr Kamat, who won from Margao constituency, credited the workers for the victory.

""The BJP-led government tried to harass me. They filed fake cases against me. They tried to jail me. Only God protected me,"" the 63-year-old leader told reporters after beating his BJP rival by over 4,000 votes.

The focus is on whether the BJP will be able to retain power and if it gets a fresh mandate, will Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar return to his home state as chief minister.

The fate of Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, whose Mandrem constituency will be taken up for counting during the first round, will be decided within the first hour of the counting.

The postal ballots and votes polled by service voters will be taken up first before calculating the numbers on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).

Tight security arrangements have been made with over 1,000 policemen deployed.

Election officials said the counting will be completed by 2.30 PM.

The votes for 19 constituencies will be counted at Panaji in North Goa, while the tally for the remaining 21 will be carried out in Margao in South Goa.

The elections held on February 4 witnessed an enthusiastic response of voters, with polling clocking in at 83 per cent.

The election has five former chief ministers besides the incumbent CM in the fray.

The Congress, the prime opponent of the BJP, has fielded four former chief ministers -- Digambar Kamat, Pratapsinh Rane, Ravi Naik and Luizinho Faleiro in their respective constituencies, while the NCP has given a ticket to Churchill Alemao.

The main fight expected to be between the Congress and the BJP, while the AAP has also put up a spirited fight on 39 seats.

The BJP has fielded 36 candidates, supporting Independents in Benaulim, Navelim, Priol and Velim. The Congress has candidates on 37 seats and has extended support to United Goans' Atanasio Monserratte in Panaji, Goa Forward's Vinod Palyekar in Siolim and Independent candidate Rohan Khaunte in Porvorim constituencies.

The BJP's major worry is an alliance between the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, the Shiv Sena and Rebel RSS leader Subhash Velingkar-led Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM).

In the 2012 assembly election, the BJP had won a majority with 21 seats followed by the Congress which had got nine seats, MGP three, Goa Vikas Party (2) while five Independent legislators were elected.

But her claims had failed to convince a large section of people who earlier supported her.  Mr Kejriwal's own party has failed to open account in Goa and is leading in only 25 seats in Punjab.

On the eve of counting in Manipur, Ms Sharmila said if defeated, she would try again -- in the 2019 national election. ""I do not feel much affected by the result because people are yet to be given a chance... Everybody knows muscle and money power are openly used,"" she had said.

But she had added that the locals in Thoubal had been happy about her decision and wished to see a change.

The BJP, which, Ms Sharmila said, had offered to finance her campaign with Central funds, is trailing in the state, show early trends. While the Congress is ahead in 22 seats, the BJP is ahead in 17, show trends at 1pm."
"Election Results 2017: BJP Sweeps Uttarakhand, Chief Minister Harish Rawat Says Blame Me","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bjp-sweeps-uttarakhand-chief-minister-harish-rawat-says-blame-me-1668793","Dehradun:                             The BJP swept the assembly elections in the hill state of Uttarakhand bagging 56 of the 70 seats with a 46 per cent vote share including two seats contested by Chief Minister Harish Rawat of the Congress who has lost his job for the second time in about a year and some political capital within the party.

The Congress won just 11 seats out of the 69 seats declared, down from its 2012 tally of 32 seats when it had formed the government with support from the Bahujan Samaj Party.  The Election Commission is yet to announce results for the Lohaghat seat, where one electronic voting machine conked out during counting. A repoll has been slated for next Wednesday for 500-odd voters served by this machine. The BJP was leading, but by a slender margin of 148 votes.

Mr Rawat had first lost the chief minister's chair last March when the Centre imposed President's rule when he was battling a rebellion within the party but was reinstated on the intervention of the Supreme Court that ruled he should have got a chance to face the trust vote in the assembly. He won the battle, but it seems, was losing the plot. Many legislators including Vijay Bahuguna, who he had replaced in 2014, switched sides and joined the BJP which had fielded them.

It didn't help that the Congress campaign in the state seemed to center around Mr Rawat - one video even projected him as Baahubali, the young hero of the blockbuster 2015 movie - who had been the target of sting operations that appeared to show him in poor light. And he was neither a match for the BJP's concerted campaign that attacked his administration for corruption nor was the Congress able to match the long list of BJP's star campaigners that also had Prime Minster Narendra Modi.

""Modi-ji's management and Amit Shah's management on the ground are visible today,"" BJP national secretary TS Rawat said.

But on Saturday the outgoing chief minister seemed prepared for the big loss. Three exit polls had forecast a landslide victory for the BJP, the fourth said the two were neck-and-neck. The aggregate - the poll of exit polls - showed that the BJP will win the state with 42 seats. Appearing before the cameras after the drubbing, Mr Rawat owned responsibility for the ""poor"" show, attributing the Congress being decimated to ""flaws in his own leadership""."
"Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017: A 360 Degree View Of BJP's Landslide Win","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-elections-2017-a-360-degree-view-of-bjps-landslide-win-1668768","(Here is a 360 degree view of the celebrations taking place outside the BJP office in Lucknow)

The BJP had learnt many lessons from its 2015 debacle in the Bihar assembly elections. One of them was not to celebrate too soon, and wait for the election trends to stabilise. Today, as a small group of workers came in early at the party's Lucknow office, there were no advance deliveries of flowers or sweets.

And then, the results started trickling in. As the spread and margin of the BJP's spectacular victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections started sinking in, the crowds started swelling, getting louder and colourful. The BJP needed 202 seats to come to power in the 403-seat assembly. It ended up with a landslide score of 312. But as the trend became clearer towards noon, people brought in the sweets, flowers and colours. It was Holi two days in advance -- workers danced to victory slogans, hugged each other and sprayed each other with colours as the party's gains seemed irreversible.

""Uttar Pradesh has fulfilled our dream of 300 seats this time,"" declared Keshav Prasad Maurya, the state party chief who got the job just 11 months ago. Soon, his face too was smeared with colour by jubilant party workers.

Less than 3 km away, outside the Samajwadi Party office, party workers had removed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's cut-outs from outside the party office well before the counting started. Later Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav insisted the alliance would survive the crash landing. For a long time, small groups of party workers who had gathered spoke with hope how the trends could change. Others trooped to the temple down the road.

A few hours later, they gave up. The writing was on the wall.

By the evening, the BJP had won 312 seats and a 39 per cent vote, just three percentage points less than 2014 general elections' 42 per cent vote share when the party had netted 71 of the state's 80 Lok Sabha seats.

The office of the Congress, which conceded that its organisational structure in the state was in shambles, wore a deserted look through the day. Ditto the BSP office that ended in the third place, after the BJP and the SP.

But if the BJP's one-step-at-a-time approach ensured it did not trip during either the campaign, or the celebrations, the AAP seemed to trip in the all guns blazing style. It repeated the BJP's mistake in Bihar, possibly encouraged by the exit polls that forecast it was within striking distance in Punjab.

Before the counting started, enthusiastic party workers had gathered outside Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's home. The venue was decorated with rows of green, saffron and white balloons and LED screens installed to keep the crowds informed about the good news as it comes. And then there was a stack of brooms, the party's election symbol that could be waved for the cameras. AAP did end up as the second largest party in Punjab - a distant second. Late in the evening, the brooms were quietly packed up and taken away."

                                        After a month-long fiercely fought election campaign, voting has wrapped up in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand. Results will be declared on Saturday, March 11. In Uttar Pradesh, which voted in seven phases, there's an intense three-way battle between the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, the BJP and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party. Punjab too will see a tough fight as the Congress and the debutant Aam Aadmi Party will try to wrest control from the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance. In Manipur, the BJP is trying hard to end the 15-year-long rule of Congress's Okram Ibobi Singh and in Uttarakhand it is hoping to unseat the ruling Congress government of Chief Minister Harish Rawat. In Goa, where the BJP is in power, the party is engaged in a fight with the opposition Congress, AAP and an alliance of MGP, Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch for the 40-member House.

"Punjab Election Result 2017: Political Parties Gear Up For Tomorrow","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/punjab-election-result-2017-political-parties-gear-up-for-tomorrow-1668349","Chandigarh:                             With exit polls predicting an end to ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) alliance, all eyes are set on the results of Punjab elections which will be declared tomorrow, March 11. Counting of votes for 117 assembly seats, which could witness a neck-and-neck fight between Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress, will begin from 8 am at 54 centres in 27 locations, said a spokesman from the election office. Live election results will also be telecast on TV screens at district election offices, prominent public places and malls. 

More than 14,000 officials have been deployed at the counting centres, where tight security arrangements have been made to ensure that the entire exercise is completed peacefully. Unauthorised persons will not be allowed to enter the counting centres. Except for election observers, nobody will be allowed to carry mobile phones.

                                        The Congress has emerged as the largest party in Goa, ahead of the BJP, that has ruled the state for five years. Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, who lost even in his own seat, resigned after it was clear that the BJP would fall well short of the halfway-mark in the 40-member Assembly. Mr Parsekar became Chief Minister after Manohar Parrikar was moved to the centre as Defence Minister in November 2014. The three main leaders of the Congress, said to be the party's top chief ministerial candidates - Luizinho Faleiro, Pratapsingh Rane and Digambar Kamat - won in their constituencies. But perhaps it was the Aam Aadmi Party that suffered the worst shock. It didn't win a single seat on its debut in the popular holiday state, despite predictions. Arvind Kejriwal and top AAP leaders had campaigned extensively here for months. With all the votes counted it remained undecided who will form Goa's next government.

"So In 2019, It Will Be Modi Versus The Rest","http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/so-in-2019-it-will-be-modi-versus-the-rest-1668358","The spectacular victory of the BJP in the present round of assembly elections has raised existential questions for several of its opponents. The Congress has managed to save its face somehow by winning Punjab convincingly and Goa by a whisker, while the outcome of Manipur is still wide open. But the thrashing received by the party in UP can hardly be compensated with a few consolation prizes. Rahul Gandhi can try to evade responsibility for the washout in UP by claiming that the Congress was the junior partner in the Alliance, but from all accounts, the Samajwadi Party was dragged down by the Congress and not the other way around. It is being universally argued that Akhilesh Yadav would have done better to go it alone. Unlike UP, the Congress has nobody to blame for its rout in Uttarakhand, where Chief Minister Harish Rawat himself lost from both the seats he contested.

Apart from the Congress, whose steady decline as a national alternative to the BJP has been clear for some time, the unexpected collapse of the BSP in UP and the failure of the Aam Aadmi Party to make a breakthrough in Punjab raise serious questions for the leadership of both these parties. 
Mayawati chose to ignore the fact that she was skating on thin ice for some years; her inability to widen the social base of the BSP would eventually lead to her party's decimation. She was also unprepared for the BJP's aggressive outreach to the Dalits whom she regarded as her permanent captives. This outreach was different from Rahul Gandhi's periodic forays into Dalit hutments and photo-ops over pre-arranged dinners. Amit Shah's outreach, on the other hand, was systematic and sustained. With the BJP/RSS cadre directed to make and maintain regular touch with non-Jatav Dalits, Mayawati's policy of talking down to her supporters increasingly gave offence even to her core followers. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it was apparent that a large segment of Dalits had voted for Modi's cross-caste appeal. But this was dismissed by the BSP leadership as a one-off phenomenon, blaming the partial desertion by a section of Dalits on the mesmerizing effect of Narendra Modi. But nobody expected this effect to spill over into the assembly polls.

Clearly, the erosion of the BSP's citadel has begun. The BJP's highly publicized delivery of pro-poor benefits such as LPG cylinders under the Ujjwala scheme has endeared the party even to those sections that hitherto considered the BJP ""untouchable"". Over the next few years, BJP governments in Delhi and Lucknow will surely consolidate their electoral base through effective delivery of promises made. By the time the 2019 Lok Sabha polls arrive, the BSP may find to its dismay that its enire Dalit constituency has been swept away by the BJP.

The present round of assembly elections and their results marks a paradigm shift in India's political idiom. For decades, the Congress has been regarded as a left-of-centre, pro-poor party which authored a slew of economic reforms aimed at subsidizing the underprivileged. During all this time, the BJP was seen as a right-of-centre party, favouring industrialists and the upper middle class. Since coming to power in April 2014, the BJP government under Narendra Modi has transformed the party's image almost completely and successfully projected itself as a welfarist party committed to the social and economic upliftment of the underprivileged. This metamorphosis of its image has enabled the BJP to redraw the ideological contours of India's politics, as evident from the assembly election results.

Much to the bewilderment of economic and political pundits, the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes added to the BJP's popular appeal. All those who travelled across rural areas of poll-bound states, especially UP, (including this writer) discovered that the rural poor believed that holders of black money and other economically affluent sections were the worst hit by demonetization. The difficulty faced by the poor was brushed aside as temporary inconvenience for a larger cause for the greater good of society. Thus, the demonetization gambit reinforced Modi's image as a crusader for the poor and against the corrupt. That most opposition parties bitterly opposed ""notebandi"" worked against them. It was widely perceived that they were against demonetization only because they were inconvenienced by the loss of ill-gotten resources. Hereafter it will be nearly impossible to dislodge Modi from the pedestal of Messiah of the poor, the same way as Indira Gandhi acquired this aura following bank nationalization and the abolition of privy purses.

The noticeable aspect of the present election results is that more than the major parties, it is the regional outfits which are facing decimation. The BSP's base seems destined to slowly wither away unless something dramatic happens. As for AAP, the absence of major corruption scandals in the Modi regime has robbed the party of its principal plank. The Samajwadi Party may recover some of its lost ground in the years to come, but it will have to steadfastly rebuild itself on planks other than caste/community coalitions. A substantial section of younger Yadavs aspiring to reach the top layers of an India in transformation voted for the BJP this time. If Modi can continue to deliver at this rate, it will deal a body blow to the politics of identity in the coming years.

Arguably, the BJP could not wipe the slate clean. The Akalis' misgovernance was a huge drag which cost the BJP a great amount of goodwill in Punjab. But this should be an eye-opener about the quality of alliances the BJP gets into; already the Shiv Sena is posing considerable challenges to the Maharashtra government. The BJP must also be prepared for most opposition parties banding together as a Grand Alliance to defeat Modi in 2019. But if the ideological and idiomatic shift of politics, as witnessed in the present round of assembly elections holds good, a Modi Versus The Rest showdown in 2019 will be to the BJP's advantage, for it will be presented as a contest between the Old, Conservative Order versus the Young, Aspirational India. No guessing then as to which side electoral fortunes will favour.

"Exit Polls May Prove Wrong - But On Modi, They're Clear","http://www.ndtv.com/blog/exit-polls-may-prove-wrong-but-on-modi-theyre-clear-1668419","Whatever else the exit polls may or may not say, they do confirm the big election story - that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has almost single-handedly lifted the BJP in Uttar Pradesh from the depths of despair to one where they are predicted to win outright or at least emerge as the largest single party. In doing so, he has not only established himself as campaigner-par-excellence but politically put to bed any adverse impact of demonetization. And if those polls that project huge majorities in UP, Uttarakhand and even Manipur turn out to be correct, then the political landscape will have changed dramatically.

While this euphoria over the forecast of a BJP sweep, except in Punjab, may have those on Twitter celebrating, the political class itself remains much more circumspect. Even BJP leaders are not popping the champagne, as memories of Bihar's exit polls being completely wrong still linger in their minds. And if you look at the gamut of predictions for tomorrow, it is obvious that some, many, or may be all  pollsters could be wrong.

Take UP, the state steals the limelight in these elections, because of its political weight. If you plot the predictions of the BJP vote and seats (see chart below) you will find that most of them have coalesced around 33% vote share and anything between 165-200 seats.Two of them have, however, proclaimed big majorities for the BJP. Of these, the News 24 Chanakya poll gives the BJP almost the same vote share as the 2014 Lok Sabha election, but trims their seats by 50 for a final count of 285. This is almost the result that would come about if you took the 2014 Lok Sabha data by assembly segments and introduced the SP-INC alliance, making it a three-cornered fight. In other words, News24 is saying that the Modi Wave of 2014 holds good in 2017. While that may be true of the later of seven phases of voting, the BJP and its supporters all admit that in the first two phases, where 140 seats were decided, the BJP under-performed considerably as compared to 2014.

Some polling also shows that Muslim consolidation around the SP-Congress could possibly have triggered a Hindu consolidation around the BJP especially in the later phases of voting. In 2014, the BJP swept eastern UP, so such a scenario remains possible. If you don't buy the consolidation of votes and so exclude the News24 projections as an outlier, then the poll of polls changes, though it continues to show the BJP well ahead but just under a majority:The other concern for the BJP would be that almost all polls have shown their vote share in UP dropping to 32-36% from 43% in 2014. That is a greater drop than happened in Bihar, and again reflects the purported early setbacks. Similarly, the SP-Congress should be very disappointed that their vote share has hardly moved from 2014 - it has declined by 6% compared to what both parties polled together in 2012. And this probably reflects the reality on the ground, where SP leaders felt that Congress votes did not transfer to them.If the polls are correct, the Congress in particular has much to be unhappy about. If all the worst-case scenarios play out for the Congress: losing Punjab, a thumping in Uttarakhand, no comeback in Goa and possibly losing Manipur, Saturday could be a very bleak day for the party.The tragedy for the Congress in Punjab is that if they win, it will be because of Captain Amarinder Singh, and if they fail to get a majority, the Captain has said he plans to retire, so the Congress will be left rudderless. Similarly, not winning in Goa will shows its inability to win against incumbency (the BJP governs the state) and losing Manipur will underscore the growing strength of the BJP in the North East.

The exit polls in Punjab also reflect two other trends: the collapse of the Akalis and with them, the BJP, is reflected in all the polls; and the continued growth of AAP shows that 2014 was not a flash in the pan and they are emerging as a major national player.If AAP wins Punjab, as some polls indicate, then not only will the Congress be worried, having lost to them heavily in Delhi, so will the BJP, whom they plan to challenge in Gujarat later this year.

In less than 12 hours, the actual results will start coming in, and many exit poll predictions will be proved wrong. Wrong, because polling isn't a science: it is a projection from a sample. The problem is that in homogenous countries, it is easier to project from small samples, but in places like UP, where more than hundreds of sub-castes exist and caste-wise voting is often the case, pollsters face the enormously difficult job of choosing their samples correctly. Now if you launch such polls across seven diverse phases, the chances of being wrong increase. 

The Trump victory in the US elections highlighted the fact that small samples cannot capture the voting variations by region and other demographics. The US election also saw a lot of people who did not admit that they were voting for Trump. Similar trends have affected Indian pollsters for many years - so take the polls with a pinch of salt. They are indicators of a pattern, or a trend, and the  ""trend"" seems to be heading BJP's way, but whether these trends convert to a sweep is a more difficult call.

"Assembly Elections 2017: BJP Parliamentary Board To Discuss Future Strategy On Saturday","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-elections-2017-bjp-parliamentary-board-to-discuss-future-strategy-on-saturday-1668282","New Delhi:                             The Bharatiya Janata Party's parliamentary board, the highest decision-making body of the political party, is likely to meet on Saturday afternoon, March 11, after assembly elections results 2017 for five states are declared.

The parliamentary board is expected to take stock of the situation and chalk out future strategy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah are among the board's 12 members. Other members include union ministers Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Ananth Kumar, Thawar Chand Gehlot and J P Nadda. 

The meeting has been tentatively scheduled for Saturday, said a party source. However, the meeting may be postponed to Sunday, depending on how the election results pan out.

On Thursday evening, the exit polls projected a good performance by the party in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The party also appears to have retained its position in Goa. 

Manipur, on the other hand, seems indecisive with one poll reflecting Congress winning the state while another projects BJP as the front-runner. In Punjab, two polls forecast a tie between the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), while one puts AAP in the lead. However, the Akali-BJP incumbent alliance has not fared well.

Though the exit polls predict a happy ending for the party, please remember, predictions can often go wrong. The counting of votes will start on Saturday morning.

The election results will give critics a window to measure Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and his chances of reclaiming a second term in 2019.

"Goa Elections 2017: BJP Will Retain The State, Say 3 Exit Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-elections-2017-bjp-will-retain-the-state-say-3-exit-polls-1668080","New Delhi:                             The poll of exit polls indicates that the BJP is likely to retain Goa again. The party is way ahead of the Congress, with 18 of the state's 40 seats. Three of the four surveys -- which were averaged by the poll of exit polls -- did not rule out a majority for the party. The ABP News-Lokniti predicted that the BJP will win 16 to 22 seats, India Today-Axis polls said 18 to 22 and India TV-C Voter gave a figure of 18 to 21. To cross the halfway mark, the BJP needs 21 seats - exactly the number it won in 2012. India News MRC said the party could win 15 seats and the Congress 10.

The poll of exit polls said the Congress -- which won 9 seats in the 2012 elections -- is likely to win 12 seats this time. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which entered the fray in Goa with high hopes after its sweep in Delhi, is likely to win 3 seats.

In absence of an outright majority, the role of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP can be crucial. The MGP, a BJP ally which won three seats last time, withdrew its support to the government in January after Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar sacked two of its ministers.

The party has since formed an alliance with the Goa Suraksha Manch or GSM and Shiv Sena, which has declared it won't enter into an alliance with the BJP again.

The state, which went to polls on February 4, had a record-breaking turnout of 83 per cent. The counting of votes will take place on March 11.  

Health Warning: Exit polls can often get it wrong."
"Goa Election Results 2017: Will BJP Return For A Second-Term?","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/goa-election-results-2017-will-bjp-return-for-a-second-term-1668454","New Delhi:                             With exit polls predicting a second-term for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Goa, all eyes are set on the election results scheduled to be declared tomorrow, March 11. Three out of the four exit polls predicted a majority for the party in the 40-member assembly, with just one indicating a hung house.  

The BJP had fielded 36 candidates and also supported independent candidates in remaining four seats. If the party misses majority, it may form an alliance with Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP). 

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar led the party's campaign in Goa. BJP chief Amit Shah had earlier hinted that the new government could work under the leadership of Mr Parrikar, fueling speculation of his return to state politics. 

Mr Parrikar, who became the Chief Minister of Goa in 2012, was later elevated to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet in 2014. Laxmikant Parsekar succeeded as the state's Chief Minister.

The Congress fielded 37 candidates and backed candidates of its associates in the remaining three seats. Senior party leaders Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digambar Kamat led the election campaign in the state.

According to the exit polls, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is making a debut in the state, is expected to win just three seats in the assembly elections. It also predicted a big win for BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. However, please remember, exit polls predictions are known for going wide off the mark. 

The counting for all the five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - will begin at 7 am."
"Exit Polls 2017 For Uttarakhand Predicts BJP Will Get Hill State","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/poll-of-exit-polls-for-uttarakhand-shows-big-win-for-bjp-1668016","HighlightsTwo out of four exit polls show win for BJP 
None of the exit polls show the BSP winning a seat
2012 elections had hung assembly, with Congress winning 32 and BJP 31Two out of five exit polls show the BJP scoring a big win in Uttarakhand, two shows the party ahead while one shows a repeat of 2012, when the party was neck and neck with the Congress. A poll of exit polls averages these surveys to show the BJP winning comfortably with 42 of the hill states 70 assembly seats, with the Congress winning 24.  

A party needs to get 36 seats to form government.

The News24-Today's Chanakya survey gives the BJP a huge majority at 53 seats, while the India Today Axis exit poll says the party will get 46 to 53. India News-MRC shows the BJP at 38 and the Congress at 30. ABP Lokniti predicts the BJP will get between 34-42, Congress 23-29 and others 3-9.

The India TV-C-Voter poll however shows both parties getting 29-35 each, with other parties wining 2-9 seats, crucial if there is a hung house.

The 2012 elections had thrown up a hung assembly, with the Congress winning 32 seats and the BJP 31. The Congress was helped by Mayawati's BSP, Independents and others to cross the majority mark.  

None of the exit polls today show the BSP or Bahujan Samaj Party winning a seat in Uttarakhand. In 2012 the BSP had won three seats and those legislators had helped Congress Chief Minister Harish Rawat survive a trust vote last year after a number of his party's legislators rebelled against him.

Several key Congress leaders had joined the BJP ahead of the Uttarakhand elections and the BJP had to fight internal unrest for choosing to field its new imports as candidates over those who have been in the party for a number of years.  

Exit polls, of course, often get it wrong and the actual results will only be known on Saturday, March 11, when votes are counted in Uttarakhand and four other states, including giant neighbour UP."

The poll of exit polls said the Congress, which trailed the BJP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party combine with only 9 seats, is likely to increase its tally to 12.

Arvind Kejriwal's AAP -- which entered the fray in Goa with high hopes but has been portrayed as an outsider by both BJP and the Congress, is likely to win 3 seats.

Considering the large number of Congress turncoats trying their luck this time as BJP candidates it will be interesting to watch out for what happens in about a dozen seats from where they are in the fray.

Narendranagar, Roorkee, Khanpur, Bajpur, Kedarnath, Sitarganj, Kotdwar are some of the high profile seats from where Congress turncoats or their protgs are in the fray.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat is trying his luck from two seats of Kichcha in Udhamsingh Nagar district and Haridwar (rural) in Haridwar district.

"Manipur Elections 2017: Congress Ahead, Shows Poll Of Exit Polls","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-congress-ahead-shows-poll-of-exit-polls-1668020","New Delhi:                             The Congress is likely to be marginally ahead of BJP in Manipur, a state it ruled for three straight terms, a poll of exit polls shows at 7 pm. Neither party is likely to get outright majority in the state's 60-member assembly, shows the poll of exit polls, which averages the surveys by the India TV-C Voter and India Today-Axis.  The poll of exit polls predicts 26 seats will go to the Congress and 24 to the BJP in the state's 60-seat assembly, where the halfway mark is at 30.

The India-TV-C Voter poll predicts the BJP will win 25 to 31 seats -- the upper end giving the party a clear majority. The Congress, it says, will trail with 17 to 23 seats.

The India Today-Axis survey gives the Congress 30 to 36 seats and the BJP between 16 and 22 seats.

Last year, the BJP had opened its account in the north-east by sweeping the assembly elections in Assam along with its allies. In the process, it ended the 15-year rule of Congress led by Tarun Gogoi.

The party won a whopping 86 of Assam's 126 seats - a victory powered by strategic acquisitions of local leaders disenchanted with the Congress.

In Manipur too, the Congress has been in power for three terms -- its government led by Chief Minister Ibobi Singh. But over the last six months, in a pattern similar to Assam, many of top Congress leaders have shifted to the BJP. Most of them belong to the Kuki tribe -- traditionally a Congress support base -- who control the hill areas.

Chief Minister Ibobi Singh tried to win back their loyalty, but his damage control measure - bifurcation of seven districts said to be for administrative convenience - has only alienated the Nagas.

The results of the two-phase polls which ended on March 8 will be declared on March 11.

Health Warning: Exit polls don't always get the results right."
"Uttarakhand Election Results 2017: Who Will Win? Exit Polls Have Bad News For Congress","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-election-results-2017-congress-and-bjp-hope-to-win-big-1668443","Dehradun:                             With results of Uttarakhand assembly election all set to be declared tomorrow, March 11, both the leading political parties are keeping their fingers crossed. While most exit polls on Thursday gave the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a clean sweep, leaders in the outgoing Congress government are confident of a win.

On Saturday, votes will be counted on 864 tables, at 15 counting centres, which will be manned by over 11,000 personnel. Heavy security arrangements have been made to ensure that after the tally is announced, there is no untoward incident between rival political parties and their supporters, an official said.

Chief Minister Harish Rawat, who faced an all-round attack from the BJP and his old associates, who switched to BJP ahead of the polls in February, was confident of winning the Uttarakhand assembly elections again. ""Based on the work done by the Congress government, we are going to form the government again,"" Mr Rawat said.

Mr Rawat predicted a ""minimum of 45 seats"" for the Congress in the 70-member house. He also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ""degrading the office of the PM"" by his language during his poll campaigns. 

""We have the blessings of the people and we are going to romp home to power again,"" he said confidently. The opposition BJP, which got 31 seats against 32 for Congress in the 2012 elections, is enthusiastic about its performance. We will get more than 50 seats and the Congress will be routed as people are not only angry at the present Rawat government but are also looking with great hope towards the BJP for development of the state,"" said BJP's Ajay Bhatt.

By-polls for 69 seats was held in Uttarakhand on February 15. Voting in the state's Udham Singhnagar constituency was held on March 9, after the death of a candidate.

Over 65 per cent of the 75.92 lakh voted in the assembly elections. The ballot took place in 10,854 polling stations. Both the Congress and the BJP contested for all the 70 assembly seats, while the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) fielded 69 candidates, Samajwadi Party 25 candidates and regional outfit Uttarakhand Kranti Dal fielded candidates for 55 seats. For a simple majority in the house, 36 seats are needed. 

During the campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the hill state to punish the Congress, which he said, had brought disrepute to the 'devbhoomi'. The Congress, on the other hand, targeted the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a host of other issues, including demonetisation. At stake is the fate of 637 candidates, of whom 62 are women and two from the third gender.

Votes will be counted from 8 am on Saturday in India's most politically crucial state, where the results will be seen as an indicator for the 2019 national election.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati and other leaders campaigned exhaustively here, addressing multiple rallies.

Uttar Pradesh, the country's biggest state with over 22 crore people, has been through long spells of President's rule, hung verdicts, mass defections and mid-term polls.

Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati ended a spell of instability when in 2007, she won a spectacular victory based on her social engineering formula that went beyond her traditional Dalit vote bank to reach out to the upper castes. In the next election in 2012, it was Akhilesh Yadav's turn to celebrate after winning comfortably.

Uttar Pradesh has been placed under President's rule 10 times, the last time in 2002.

There is hardly any combination that has not been tried in the state.

In the late 1990s, the BJP and Mayawati came together with a plan to rotate the chief minister's post between the parties for a six-month period - an experiment that didn't work.

Of the 16 state assemblies elected since 1952, a single party won a majority and completed a full five-year term only seven times. Nine times, governments were short-lived - one lasted four months.

Mid-term elections have been called as many as seven times; the last time was in 1998.

Uttar Pradesh was the base and the favourite hunting ground for the Congress in the initial years after Independence, when many top leaders leading state and national politics. But it was this state that became the first to get a non-Congress government.  

In 1967, Charan Singh and his socialist colleagues left the Congress to form the Bharatiya Kranti Dal and formed the government.

Senior Samajwadi leader and a minister in the Akhilesh Yadav cabinet, Ravidas Mehrotra, while questioning the SP-Congress alliance, said the SP would have won on its own and there was no need for this tie-up with the Congress. He also said that in the final outcome the Congress would have gained from the alliance and not the Samajwadi Party.

While senior party leaders and workers have been questioning the tie-up right since beginning, it had so far been in private. Mehrotra is the first to have expressed his feelings openly in public.

In a related development, Urban Development Minister Mohd Adam Khan, said in case the SP lost at the hustings, the blame would not be of Akhilesh Yadav alone.

""Khuda na kare aisi naubat aaye, gar aisa hua to iski zimmedari sabki hoga aur ye nuksaan poore pradesh ka hoga (God forbid that such a result happens then the responsibility should be shared by all),"" he said.

He also said that Mulayam Singh Yadav's wife Sadhna Gupta's statement that ""Akhilesh should not have humiliated his father"" in a recent interview ""could have been avoided"".

SP contested the assembly elections in alliance with the Congress which was given 105 seats and the remaining 298 were contested by it. Voting for the 403 seats of the UP assembly will be counted at 75 counting centres in the state from 8am on Saturday."

Not ruling out post poll alliance with BSP, says Akhilesh Yadav
Elections in the state were held in seven phases
                                The much-anticipated climax of the high decibel assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh is just a few hours away. The seven-phased polls spread over a month of voting had its share of firsts, avoidable gaffes and embarrassing statements.

It was for the first time since 1999 that Congress President Sonia Gandhi didn't campaign in Uttar Pradesh, from where she and son Rahul Gandhi are members of the Lok Sabha. She is currently undergoing medical treatment abroad.

It was also unusual that BJP veterans LK Advani and Kanpur MP Murli Manohar Joshi didn't hit the campaign trail. Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and the presumptive Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, before the Congress struck an alliance with the SP, also remained absent.

Another bigwig Samajwadi Party patriarch and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was also missing in action, well mostly, and campaigned only for daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, who contested from Lucknow Cantt and brother Shivpal Singh Yadav in Jaswantnagar. In contrast, he had addressed at least 300 rallies during the 2012 elections.

After a poll of exit polls last evening showed the BJP getting 211 of the state's 403 assembly seats, Mr Akhilesh, who had earlier ruled out a post-poll alliance with the BSP, said that if there is a hung assembly, he will prefer a partnership with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party over President's Rule in the state. Who would have imagined that?

Mulayam Singh's second wife Sadhna Gupta, just hours before the last round of polling in Poorvanchal, alleged in an hour-long interview that ""no matter what, nobody should have disrespected Netaji, it is he who founded and nurtured the party"". After staying quiet for the past two decades, this was Ms Sadhna's first public outing.

The UP elections were held in seven phases. Counting of votes will begin at 8am on March 11.

Counting of votes will begin at 8 am today and trends are expected to start coming in at 11 am.

In the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh - India's largest and the most crucial to its politics - the BJP ran a hard-fought campaign to wrest power from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (which contested this time in alliance with Rahul Gandhi's Congress). An aggregate of Exit Polls have predicted a win for the BJP.

In Punjab however, all exit polls have predicted a wipeout for the ruling Akali Dal-BJP alliance and contest is seen between the Congress and the Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur election results will also throw up interesting political insights - critical for a read of the way things are shaping for the 2019 General Elections.

Counting will take place at 157 centres -- Punjab (53), Goa (2), UP (75), Uttarakhand (15) and Manipur (12). By 12 noon, a final picture could emerge on who would be the major players in the five states.

According to Election Commission guidelines, half-an-hour after the postal ballots are counted, the process of counting of EVM votes begins.

The 'ballot unit' is switched on in the presence of senior poll officials and counting agents of candidates and the result command keyed in to get the results per machine.

Where a paper trail audit or 'voter-verified paper audit trail' (VVPAT) has been used, the counting agent can call for a count of the paper slips in the drop box attached to the voting machine, but a final count is taken by the returning officer.

Once the results are declared, the names of the winning candidates will find mention in the gazette. The gazette notification will initiate the process to form the next legislative assemblies in the states.

Among many interesting events in the state, one polling station in the remote Saikul constituency in the newly created Kangpokpi district saw voting thrice this season.

Saikul, 60km away from Imphal, has 11 candidates in the fray - highest for any constituency in this poll. This tribal-reserved seat is dominated by the Kuki tribe, and went to polls on March 4 in the first phase.

""It is a crucial seat and we had ensured a tight security cover yet we found some malpractices and ordered a repoll,"" Manipur's Chief Electoral officer VK Dewangan told NDTV.

The repolling took place yesterday, but the BJP again filed a complaint against the Congress candidate for booth capturing and the EC after scrutiny ordered another repoll.

About 1,000 voters are voting for the third time today.

""People from remote areas have actively participated in the polls. The political parties are locked in a fierce battle in Saikul which has many heavyweight candidates this time,"" said local journalist Kaybie Chongloi from Kangpokpi.

The EC had directed that the polling was to be held in the Saikul police station and not in the polling booth that was allegedly 'rigged' twice.

The Manipur assembly election 2017 has been unique in many ways. From peaceful polling amid a four-month long economic blockade, the BJP's surge as a formidable opponent in this Congress stronghold to activist Irom Sharmila's foray into politics and a high voter turnout in the two-phased polls for the 60-member assembly, Manipur is experiencing an exciting moment.

The first phase recorded 86.5 per cent polling, followed by 88 per cent in the second phase. Repolling at 34 booths in eight constituencies of the first phase yesterday stood at 89 per cent."

                                Navjot Singh Sidhu, who joined the Congress days before the Punjab assembly elections, has junked exit poll predictions that say his party is in a neck and neck race with the Aam Aadmi Party for the number 1 spot in the state, where poll results will be announced today.   

""The ground reality is very different, for voters per seat above 1.5 lakh you can't decide on the basis of exit polls that have a 20,000 sample size,"" the cricketer turned politician said. He has predicted that Arvind Kejriwal's ""AAP will get around 40 seats and the Akali-BJP won't get more than 10."" The Congress he reckons will win the rest.

Punjab has 117 assembly seats. To form government a party needs to win 59 seats. Exit polls on Thursday predicted a big rout for the incumbent Akali Dal- BJP government and a close finish between the Congress and AAP, which makes its debut in assembly elections in the state.

Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal of the Akali Dal, which has along with ally BJP, ruled Punjab for the last 10 years, too said the exit polls have got it wrong. He said his alliance would win 72 seats in the state to be re-elected for a third straight term.

Mr Sidhu, who quit the BJP after a decade in the party last year, was in talks for weeks with Mr Kejriwal, who is also Delhi Chief Minister, to join AAP. Those negotiations failed reportedly over Mr Sidhu's demand that he be projected as the party's presumptive Chief Minister.

He then held prolonged talks with the Congress before joining the party in a deal said to have been clinched by the Congress' Priyanka Gandhi, credited by her party with playing a bigger strategic role than before in these assembly elections. The Congress has also said that Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, ensured the alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh.

Counting of votes for both the Punjab and UP assembly elections, as also in three other states - Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa - will begin at 8 am on Saturday."

Exit polls on Manipur suggest a marginal lead for the ruling Congress government in the state. Neither the Congress nor the BJP is likely to get outright majority in the state's 60-member assembly, as per exit polls.

The Congress has been in power in the state for three straight terms. The poll of exit polls predicts 26 seats for the Congress and 24 for the BJP in the 60-member assembly. A party needs to have 31 nseats to form the government.

The India Today-Axis survey predicts 30 to 36 seats for the Congress. The BJP, it says, will get between 16 and 22 seats.

Chief Minister Ibobi Singh has been worried about the BJP presence in the state. The BJP, which had failed to win a single seat five years ago in the 60-member Manipur assembly, has proved to be a major concern for the Congress, that has witnessed many of its leaders shifting loyalties to the BJP. Many of the leaders who joined the party belong to the Kuki tribe - traditionally a Congress support base - who control the hill areas. Also, Ibobi Singh's decision to bifurcate seven districts has only alienated the Nagas.

Poll of exit polls showed BJP getting 211 of UP's 403 assembly seats
Counting of votes will take place on March 11
                                Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has done a neat u-turn today saying his Samajwadi Party is open to a partnership with arch-rival Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh if needed, even as a poll of exit polls this evening showed the BJP getting 211 of the state's 403 assembly seats, which would put it safely past the 202 needed to form government.

At 8.30 pm on Thursday, an aggregate of six exit polls showed the BJP getting 211, the Samajwadi Party-Congress 122 and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 61 seats.

Two surveys helped the BJP past the halfway mark in the poll of exit polls by predicting a huge win for the party - India Today-Axis has predicted that the BJP will get between 251 and 285 seats, while News 24 - Today's Chanakya gives the party 285 seats.

Three other exit polls show the BJP well ahead of the other parties but falling short of 202, while one, by Times Now - VMR predicts the party will get between 190 to 210 seats, the upper end of which will give it a majority.
 
Akhilesh Yadav, who had only days ago emphatically ruled out a post-poll alliance with the BSP, has been quoted by BBC Hindi today as saying that if there is a hung assembly in the state on Saturday, when results will be announced, he will prefer a partnership with Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party over President's Rule in the state.

""I have always treated the BSP (Mayawati's party) with respect, so it's natural for people to assume we may seek her help. It's difficult to say at this point. I am confident the Congress-SP alliance will win...but look, nobody wants President's Rule, the BJP to run Uttar Pradesh by remote control,"" Mr Yadav said. In election speeches this year Ms Mayawati has attacked Akhilesh's father Mulayam Singh Yadav, but rarely the young Chief Minister. 


Mr Yadav has been ""changing his stand for the past six months,"" alleged senior BJP leader Om Mathur dismissing the possibility of a close contest. ""The BJP will form government in UP with two-thirds majority. All polls indicate a change in UP,"" he said.

Rita Bahuguna, imported by the BJP from the Congress just before the elections, said her party will get ""at least 240 seats in UP""

""Not fair to be so confident of a win even before the votes have been counted,"" said the Congress' Sachin Pilot, whose party has partnered with Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party for the UP elections.

The marathon UP election, held over seven rounds of voting, is seen as a bellwether for the 2019 national election. The BJP is seeking to form government after 15 years in the country's most populous state and did not project a presumptive Chief Minister, asking for votes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development agenda.

The result will also be seen as a referendum on PM Modi's notes ban in November last year, aimed at eliminating corruption and black money. It resulted in a cash crunch that rival parties made a core issue to attack the BJP with.

Akhilesh Yadav came out of a family feud that saw him dethrone his father Mulayam Singh Yadav as Samajwadi Party chief, to seek re-election in partnership with the Congress.  

Results will be declared for UP and four other states on Saturday, March 11.

Three exit polls have predicted that the BJP will get a landslide victory in the 70-member assembly, while a fourth poll shows the BJP and the Congress tied. The aggregate -- the poll of exit polls -- shows the BJP decisively winning the hill state. A party needs to get 36 seats to form government in the 70-member hill state.

The 2012 elections had thrown up a hung assembly, with the Congress winning 32 seats and the BJP 31. The Congress got help from Mayawati's BSP, Independents and others to cross the majority mark.  The BSP legislators also played a crucial role last year, helping the Harish Rawat government survive a trust vote after a number of Congress legislators rebelled against him.

None of the exit polls today show the BSP winning a seat this year. The party had won 3 seats in 2012.

Ahead of the elections, several Congress leaders joined the BJP, which fielded them despite challenge from local leaders. The strategy seem to have paid off if the exit polls are to be believed. Two out of four exit polls showed the BJP scoring a big win in the state, one shows the party ahead while one shows a repeat of 2012, when the party was neck and neck with the Congress.

The picture for Uttar Pradesh is clear - the BJP is ahead, based on an aggregate of the polls - whereas in Punjab, it's a very close call with one poll forecasting a perfect tie for the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party. Uttarakhand has definitively picked the BJP, according to most polls; the party appears to have retained Goa; Manipur's decision is no clearer with exit polls - one shows the Congress holding the state, another shows it switching to the BJP.

Remember the usual health warning: exit polls often get it wrong. Results will be declared on Saturday, when you can watch election guru Prannoy Roy on NDTV, starting at 7 am on air and on our site and apps. For now, we're looking at the poll of exit polls for each state - the aggregate of different polls.

Who will win Uttar Pradesh which has 403 seats? The majority mark is 202. The BJP gets 211 according to the poll of polls - that means it will form the government. Mayawati places third in all options.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav told BBC Hindi that he cannot rule out seeking a partnership with Mayawati, if his alliance with the Congress falls short. ""I have always treated the BSP (Mayawati's party) with respect, so it's natural for people to assume we may seek her help. It's difficult to say at this point. I am confident the Congress-SP alliance will win...but look, nobody wants President's Rule, the BJP to run Uttar Pradesh by remote control.""
 
For Punjab, based on five exit polls, it's nearly too-close-to-call. Two polls show the Congress winning, the other shows AAP ahead; two place the parties neck-and-neck. The aggregate shows the same with the Congress ahead by just two seats. The Akali-BJP incumbent alliance is demolished.
 
Uttarakhand, which has 70 seats, is a landslide win for the BJP according to three exit polls, but a fourth poll shows the BJP and the Congress tied. The aggregate shows BJP decisively winning the hill state.
 
Three exit polls for Goa, which has 40 seats show the BJP retaining the state.
 
Manipur which has 60 seats is forecast to pick the BJP in one poll, and the Congress in another.
  The election results will be used to measure Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and his chances of returning for a second term in 2019. The BJP's performance will also be seen as a referendum on the PM's abrupt decision in November to ban high-denomination notes to crackdown on corruption and tax evasion."

For the Congress and its Chief Ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh, it is a chance to gain power in a state where it has out of power for a decade. The ruling Akali-BJP combine, meanwhile, is trying to gain a third consecutive term in face of opposition claims of corruption and anti-incumbency.

But the four-cornered contest has not thrown a clear verdict, exit polls have said. The Congress came neck and neck with the AAP, says the poll of exit polls. Two polls show the Congress winning, the other shows AAP ahead. Two exit polls say the parties will be neck-and-neck. The aggregate puts the Congress ahead only by two seats and predicts a hung house. It also says the Akali-BJP alliance will be trounced with only 19 to 27 seats. 

Whether the exit polls were right or went wide off the mark can be known only on Saturday, March 11, when the votes for all five states that went to polls - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur - will be counted.

ADR said 31 candidates were not analysed due to unclear affidavit available on the ECI website.

It found as many as 1,457 crorepati candidates across the seven phases (30 per cent), while the overall average asset of those in the fray stood at Rs 1.91 crore.

The share of those with criminal cases stood at 19 per cent in the UP assembly polls in 2012, while the number of candidates with serious criminal cases, including cases related to rape, murder, kidnapping, communal disharmony and crime against women, has gone up from 8 per cent in the last elections.

ADR said 62 candidates have declared cases related to murder, while 148 candidates have declared cases of attempt to murder in the ongoing elections.

"PM Narendra Modi To Cover Wider Area In Today's Varanasi Road Show","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-cover-wider-area-in-tomorrows-varanasi-road-show-1666221","Varanasi:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a road show today in support of local BJP candidates and later address a rally as he pulls out all the stops ahead of the last phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls on March 8. The events would follow massive back to back road shows held by PM Modi and UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi through the holy city today.

The BJP leaders said Mr Modi's road show today will cover a different and much wider area during which the party candidates would accompany him.

Yesterday, Mr Modi paid obeisance at the historic Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples as part of his mega road show.

The campaign led by Mr Modi in the city underlines the stake the BJP has in the Prime Minister's Lok Sabha constituency where it had won three of the five assembly seats in 2012. The Samajwadi Party had won the remaining two.

However, what is significant is that the SP and the Congress, both allies now but rivals five years back, had together polled more votes than the BJP in two of the three seats it had won.

With Mr Modi now representing Varanasi in the Lok Sabha, his party is doing all it can to put up a commanding performance.

A host of Union ministers and top BJP leaders led by Amit Shah have been camping here to lead the party's campaign for the last phase of polls.

The Prime Minister will stay in Varanasi overnight and hold more public events tomorrow.

As many as 40 seats will go to the polls in the last phase of the UP elections on March 8. The results will be out on March 11."

"Can Team Akhilesh-Rahul Do Magic In UP? Here's What The Numbers Say","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/can-team-akhilesh-rahul-do-magic-in-up-heres-what-the-numbers-say-1666239","Lucknow: HighlightsSamajwadi Party, Congress drew 43% vote share in 2012 UP polls
In 2014 general elections, BJP won equivalent of 337 of 403 seats
SP-Congress must retain core vote share of 36% to stand a chance in 2017
                                As chief minister Akhilesh Yadav seeks to be re-elected in Uttar Pradesh, will his Samajwadi Party's strategic alliance with the Congress help him in his bid? Yes, if the state votes like it did five years ago in the assembly elections of 2012. No, if it votes the way it did in the 2014 general elections.

In 2012, Akhilesh Yadav led his party to victory in UP, winning 226 of the state's 403 assembly seats. The Samajwadi Party got 29 per cent of the votes. The Congress, with 14 per cent vote share, had won 38 seats. In quite a few seats the Congress was second.

If the two parties had fought that election together as they are now, they would've won 43 per cent of the vote share, with the Samajwadi Party winning 270 seats and the Congress 82. It would have meant 88 more seats with a combined total of 352 - a landslide win.

The additional seats would have come mostly at the cost of Mayawati's BSP. Her party, which had won 80 seats in 2012, would've won only 20 seats if the SP and Congress had been partners then.
The 2014 general election, however, was a complete contrast. The BJP, which had won only 47 seats with its 15 per cent vote share in 2012, rode a Modi wave to win 71 of UP's 80 parliamentary seats along with ally Apna Dal, equal to 337 assembly seats.
If the Samajwadi Party, which got 20 per cent votes for five Lok Sabha seats or 42 assembly seats, and the Congress - eight per cent votes for two Lok Sabha seats (15 assembly seats) - had been partners in 2014, they would've together won the equivalent of 85 assembly seats, denting the BJP's number by about only 27 seats only.
 
On numbers, the UP alliance is not quite as ""grand"" as the one that the Congress had built for the 2015 Bihar assembly elections with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United and Lalu Prasad's RJD. The coming together of the three parties had meant that a consolidation of their core votes added up to 47 per cent of the vote share.

The core votes of the Samajwadi Party and the Congress add up to 36 per cent in UP. The two parties are fighting hard to hold on to the their core support bases in the face of a tough challenge from both the BJP and the BSP. 
The UP elections are being held in seven phases. Votes will be counted on March 11."

Governor E S L Narasimhan articulated the state's stand while addressing the joint session of the Addhra Pradesh legislative Council and the Assembly on the opening day of the Budget session in the new Legislature building in Amaravati.

""My government is in full agreement with the view that elections to both state assemblies and Lok Sabha be held simultaneously so that Centre and state governments could pay their undivided attention to issues of policy and governance.

We will go a step further and suggest that elections to urban and rural local bodies too should be held within one year of the elections to the State and Central legislative Houses,"" the Governor said.

""Historically, elections to state assemblies and Lok Sabha began together but over the years, for varied reasons, they were de-coupled. Now the situation has come to a stage that we conduct elections in significantly large parts of the country almost every year, if not throughout the year. Political parties, and therefore governments, have to continually keep an eye on electoral calculations,"" Mr Narasimhan pointed out.

Simultaneous polls would give governments a ""full four years of undistracted"" time to address issues of governance, the Governor said, adding ""it is desirable"" to have a national debate involving all sections of people."

PM Modi, who arrived in the city yesterday morning, held a roadshow followed by a public meeting late in the evening. This is the second roadshow that he is holding in two days in his Lok Sabha constituency with less than three days left for the final phase of polls in the state. The opposition criticised his yesterday's roadshow and the Congress even lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging that the show of strength was made without the requisite permission.

Here are the live updates of PM Modi's speech:I do not know how to thank people of Kashi. They have broken yesterday's records. This love and affection inspires me to serve people moreI had started a rally from Kashmir to Kanyakumari under Murali Manohar JoshiVaranasi has a special place in the heart of every Indian.It is not only a city but a city of traditions and culture.I have big dreams for Varanasi.Our aim is of a Banaras that is modern yet retains its heritage.Our motto is sabka saath sabka vikas, but Congress, SP and BSP have different culture of politics that says kuch ka saath kuch ka vikasThe eastern part of India has to scale new heights of development.UP government is not letting my work show.Notes ban united other parties against me.This land of Uttar Pradesh, this part of the state is blessed with very talented people. The potential for development is immense.Had there been good and proper government, then the states could have flourished even further.Shouldn't corruption come to an end? Its been so many years since we attained freedom but a small section misused their power and position.UP government hasn't been able to utilise the funds given by centre.I want to tell all honest citizens- no one will ever trouble you. Immandar Ka Samman HogaEarlier the question being asked would be- what money was lost (in the scams), now the question is- Modi Ji what has come backIt is sad that driven by politics, some people wanted proof of surgical strikes and were asking did any Indian soldier dieI have inherited nothing. Whatever I have got is from the people of KashiWe wanted to build a ring road but the state government did not cooperate and kept obstructing that. They did not cooperate.Every Indian should have his or her own home by 2022. It is sad that so many years after independence also people do not have homes."

"UP Elections 2017: Curtains Down On Hectic Campaigning In State, Politicians Take Chota Sa Break","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-curtains-down-on-hectic-campaigning-in-state-politicians-take-a-break-1667192","Chandel, Manipur:                             Activist Irom Sharmila's challenge to Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh of the Congress in his Thoubal constituency, is the most watched contest in tomorrow's second and last round of assembly elections in Manipur. But it is the BJP that has the man who has ruled the state for the last 15 years worried.

In the crucial second phase, 22 constituencies will vote. Ten of these are in Thoubal district in the valley and considered Chief Minister Ibobi Singh's stronghold. The rest are in the tribal-dominated hills. Of these 22 seats, the Congress had won 14 and two other MLAs later joined it. Effectively, the ruling party is fighting to retain 16 seats tomorrow.

The BJP, which hopes to win its third state in the northeast after Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, did not win a single seat five years ago in the 60-member Manipur assembly. But most of the Congress' top leaders from the hill areas have switched to the BJP in the last six months. Most of them are from the Kuki tribe, traditionally a Congress support base.  

Ibobi Singh has attempted damage control in the last few months by carving out seven new districts for ""administrative convenience,"" a decision that has made the Kukis happy. But the Nagas are upset. The issue has polarised voters like never before, setting plains against hills and tribe against tribe.

While it is not clear whether the Congress has salvaged support among the Kukis, the BJP may be unable to tap into the Naga anger. Since the district split in December last year, the BJP has made inroads in the hills, but the Naga People's Front or NPF, a BJP ally at the centre and in Nagaland, is contesting separately in Manipur.

The NPF, which has opposed the creation of the seven districts, debuted in the last assembly elections winning four seats out of the 12 it contested - all in the hills. It is contesting 15 seats this time.

A straight BJP versus NPF contest is expected in four Naga-majority districts -- Tamenlong, Chandel, Ukhrul and Senapati, which could benefit the Congress. The other seats have a large population of Kukis, and these are being watched closely for how they vote.

Two Congress legislators moved to the BJP after they were ""banned"" from their constituencies in the Kuki belt in 2015 following violence over three bills passed by Ibobi Singh's government that were seen as ""anti-tribal"". Nine people had died in violent protests, six of them in police firing.

The BJP is also eyeing the 10 seats in Thoubal district, reaching out to the minority voters, the Manipuri Muslims or Meitei Pangals. They are about 10 per cent of the state's 19 lakh voters and could influence at least six Thoubal constituencies.

Activist Irom Sharmila, who broke a 16-year hunger strike against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act last year, has since launched the 'Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance' and is contesting three seats in Manipur.

The first round of voting in Manipur last Saturday for 38 seats saw a record 86.5 per cent turnout. The BJP says the high turnout is a vote for change. The Congress claims it has swept Manipur every time there has been record voting.

Votes will be counted on Saturday, March 11."
"UP Elections 2017: Amid Rose Petal Shower, Slogans, PM Modi Holds Varanasi Roadshow","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modi-begins-roadshow-in-varanasi-1666378","Varanasi: HighlightsPM Modi is campaigning in Varanasi ahead of phase 7 polls in UP
This is his second roadshow in the city in 2 days
Uttar Pradesh will vote in final phase on March 8; counting on March 11
                                The narrow streets of temple town Varanasi turned into a sea of saffron flags as Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his second roadshow in as many days in his parliamentary constituency. With just three days to go for the last and final phase of the crucial assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has pulled all stops - with the Prime Minister planning to campaign in Varanasi for three consecutive days.  Today, PM Modi rode an open-top vehicle, waving to flag and balloon-waving supporters who all but choked the road. Chants of ""Modi, Modi"" and ""Vandemataram"" could be heard throughout the 5-km stretch from Police Lines to Kashi Vidyapeeth.

Later this evening, he is expected to address an election rally. He is expected to stay in the city overnight and tomorrow, before campaigning ends, will lead another rally and address a meeting.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister had hit the campaign trail in the temple town with an impromptu roadshow while he was on his way to two of the city's most revered shrines -- Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples -- in the morning. In the evening, he had held a public meeting.

Critics have questioned the appropriateness of the Prime Minister holding a roadshow. Even BJP's Union minister Upendra Kushwaha had said he didn't feel ""it was right"".

The SP, BSP and the Congress have alleged that the BJP's continued focus on Varanasi only betrays its nervousness about the contests in the high-profile constituency. In 2012, the party had won only three of the five assembly constituencies that comprise PM Modi's parliamentary seat. The Samajwadi Party had won the other two.

Hitting out at the Prime Minister, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who was speaking at a rally in Sonbhadra, said, ""One roadshow was done. It failed. He is doing one more. It will also fail and
then again a roadshow will be held...Now he will go somewhere else"".

The opposition criticised yesterday's roadshow and the Congress had even lodged a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging that the show of strength was made without the necessary permissions. The BJP said the show was entirely impromptu."
"On Election Commission Wishlist: Barring Candidates Who Default On Power, Water Bills","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/on-election-commission-wishlist-barring-candidates-who-default-on-power-water-bills-1666425","New Delhi:                             The Election Commission wants laws to be changed so that it can disqualify from contesting polls the candidates who do not clear their water and power bills.

It has asked the Law Ministry to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1951, so that such defaulters can be barred from contesting Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.

According to the poll panel, it will require amendment to the chapter-III of the RP Act which deals with electoral offences.

A new clause will have to be inserted therein for disqualification ""on the ground of being a defaulter of public dues"".

The issue is pending with the government. In an August, 2015 order, the Delhi High Court had asked the Commission to ensure that candidates contesting Lok Sabha and Assembly elections furnish a 'no dues certificate' from the agency providing electricity, water and telephone connections to their accommodation.

Since February, 2016, the Commission had been insisting on an additional affidavit in the prescribed format along with the 'No Demand Certificate' from the agencies providing these services.

A 'no rent due' certificate is also required in case the candidate had been occupying government accommodation during the 10 years leading to the polls.

The Delhi High Court, while delivering the verdict, had said that those wanting to contest elections will clear their dues after the order.

In March 2016, when the EC had met political parties here to discuss electoral reforms, it was told that the 'no dues certificate' for candidates was leading to corruption as bribes were being allegedly paid to obtain it.

Recently, the Commission had proposed that political parties, as a pre-condition for fielding candidates, furnish affidavit stating that they have not defaulted on dues on account of usages of public utilities."
"Manipur Elections 2017: It's BJP Versus Ibobi Singh In Thoubal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-its-bjp-versus-ibobi-singh-in-thoubal-1666741","Thoubal, Manipur:                             After an encouraging voter turnout of 87 per cent in the first phase of Manipur assembly election, the BJP went full throttle with campaigning for the second phase where voting for the remaining 22 seats will take place on March 8.

The BJP is eyeing the 10 seats in the Thoubal district that has been three-time Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh's bastion for the last 15 years. Thoubal is also the most keenly watched seat in the assembly election where activist-turned-politician Irom Sharmila is taking on Mr Ibobi Singh.

The BJP is doing every bit to reach out to the minority voters, the Manipuri Muslims or Meitei Pangals. They constitute about 10 per cent of the state's 19 lakh voters. Of the 22 seats that go to polls in the second phase, Muslim votes are going to influence at least six constituencies in the Thoubal district.

""The Congress calls us communal, but we have an alliance with People's Democratic Party in Jammu and Kashmir. In the Christian-dominated Nagaland, we have an alliance with the ruling party. We never do politics of communities,"" BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav said while addressing a gathering in Lilong in Thoubal yesterday.

The BJP's sole Muslim candidate in Manipur is from Lilong. Nobody would have envisaged a BJP rally in Thoubal especially in the minority belt of Lilong in the early days. Clearly times have changed.

Chief Minister Ibobi Singh, on the other hand, asserts that the Congress has always promoted communal harmony in the northeastern state.

""We have ensured sharing of power with the minorities at the grass-root level,"" Ibobi Singh had told Muslim voters during several rallies.  

Congress had won nine of the 10 seats in Thoubal in the last election. Manipur's biggest political survivor, Mr Ibobi Singh, has lost only once in Thoubal. His supporters claim that Thoubal is as developed as Imphal, Manipur's capital.

""In his three terms, Mr Ibobi Singh has done a lot of development work for Thoubal and Manipur. We are happy with his efforts,"" said Binoba Devi, Thoubal resident."
"As Varanasi Votes, PM Narendra Modi Is Back Home In Gujarat After Hectic UP Campaign","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-varanasi-votes-pm-narendra-modi-is-back-home-in-gujarat-after-hectic-up-campaign-1667368","Ahmedabad:                             As Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh reported brisk voting on Wednesday morning, PM Modi was in his home state Gujarat, deep in prayer at the famous Somnath temple. With him was BJP chief Amit Shah. Both leaders are in Gujarat after a hectic campaign that saw them camped in Varanasi in a bid to secure the crucial eastern UP region for the BJP in assembly elections in the country's most populous state.   

In Somnath, PM Modi and Mr Shah will attend a meeting of the temple trust of which both are members, before PM Modi returns to capital Gandhinagar to address 6,000 women sarpanch or village heads on Women's Day. Last night he was hosted for dinner by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani attended by BJP members of parliament and party legislators in Gujarat.

Just out of an intense campaign in the marathon seven-phase Uttar Pradesh election, PM Modi's visit to Gujarat is being linked to assembly elections in his home state due later this year. A massive revolt by the Patels or Patidaars in Gujarat, once a staunch support base of the BJP, has put the party on the backfoot after over two decades of ruling the state.

As Amit Shah drove up to Somnath on Monday night, Patel protesters threw eggs at his cavalcade and raised slogans against him. The Patels are angry that the BJP government has not accepted its demand for reservation in government jobs and colleges.

On Tuesday, PM Modi also announced that eight state highways will converted into national highways, inaugurated a petrochemical investors region and also the country's biggest cable bridge in Bharuch, south Gujarat.  Most of the highways are in Saurashtra, dominated by Patels.

The assembly elections in Gujarat - where PM Modi was chief minister for 13 years before he moved to Delhi after the BJP's big win in the 2014 national election - will be the next big test for the BJP after the UP elections.   

The party has gone flat out to try and replicate its success in the 2014 national election when it had won 71 - 73 along with partner Apna Dal - of UP's 80 seats. Worries for it have come from western UP, where the Jats, who voted en masse for the BJP in the national election, are upset over PM Modi's notes ban and over their demand for reservation not being met.

The party has attempted to make up in eastern UP, where 40 constituencies are voting today in the seventh and last round of voting in the state, which has 403 seats in its legislature.

PM Modi's Varanasi has eight assembly seats - the BJP currently holds three of those, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party have two each and the Congress has one.

Votes will be counted on Saturday, March 11."
"UP Elections 2017: BJP's Varun Gandhi Was 'Too Busy' To Campaign In UP, Says Mother Maneka","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-bjps-varun-gandhi-was-too-busy-to-campaign-in-up-explains-mother-maneka-1666750","New Delhi: HighlightsVarun Gandhi is a member of Parliament from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh
Mr Gandhi reportedly upset BJP didn't back him over 'honey-trap' scandal
Mr Gandhi's supporters say he should have been BJP's face in UP
                                BJP leader Varun Gandhi was ""too busy"" to campaign for his party in the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, his mother and union minister Maneka Gandhi said today. Campaigning ended in the state on Monday in a marathon election spread over seven rounds and 30 days (February 11-March 11), that saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi address 23 public rallies and BJP chief Amit Shah and top union ministers campaign extensively as the BJP attempts to come back to power in UP after 15 years.

 ""Varun (Gandhi) has been very busy. He's been travelling to speak to students across the country at various campuses,"" Mrs Gandhi said, also pointing out that he is 36 years old and so she really can't speak for him.

Mr Gandhi, the BJP member of Parliament from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh, reportedly excused himself from campaigning in the state as he was upset that the party did not back him amid allegations that he was honey-trapped into revealing defence secrets last year. He did not feature in the first lists of star campaigners that the BJP released and when he was included, it was as an after thought, seen as damage control by the party amid threats of rebellion by Varun Gandhi's supporters in UP.

Mr Gandhi's supporters say the party has sidelined a leader who should have been projected as presumptive chief minister in UP. Some of them, denied BJP ticket, have contested as candidates of rival parties like Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal.

Maneka Gandhi would only say, ""we will soon find out,"" when asked whether she thought not projecting a chief ministerial candidate would hurt the party in UP. The women and child development minister, who represents UP's Pilibhit in parliament, has campaigned a little.

She said she was glad PM Modi had undertaken an extensive campaign in Uttar Pradesh. ""I am glad that the Prime Minister is travelling in Uttar Pradesh, he will see the kind of poor conditions in the state,'' Mrs Gandhi said."
"After State Polls, Election Panel To Decide Fate of Arvind Kejriwal's 21 MLAs","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/after-state-polls-election-panel-to-decide-fate-of-arvind-kejriwals-21-mlas-1666189","NEW DELHI:                             The Election Commission's hearing for final arguments to decide the fate of 21 Aam Aadmi Party legislators in Delhi accused of violating the office of profit rule will be held on March 16, days after the commission completes the ongoing election process for five states.

The 21 lawmakers were appointed as parliamentary secretaries to ministers in the Arvind Kejriwal government after AAP swept the 2015 assembly elections in the national capital. Last year, a complaint was filed with the President that the legislators - who cannot hold any public office that entitles them to benefits, financial or otherwise - should be disqualified for taking up the job. The Election Commission, which is mandated to give its recommendations, had started hearings last July.

The Commission has sent notice for the hearing to Prashant Patel who filed the complaint and the 21 lawmakers including Alka Lamba, Jarnail Singh, Adarsh Shastri and Rajesh Gupta, an EC official said.

Kejriwal had defended the appointments saying the legislators were helping the government deliver on the promises made to the people and weren't paid from the exchequer for the extra work that they put in.

The idea behind this provision was to draw a line between the legislature and the executive; so that legislators irrespective of their party affiliation were able to hold the government responsible in the assembly rather than be indebted to it.

As had been done on many occasions in the past by governments, the Kejriwal government tried to circumvent the constitutional bar by getting a bill passed in the assembly to exempt the parliamentary secretary's post from the office of profit. But President Pranab Mukherjee refused to clear the law.

The disqualification proceedings before the EC have also survived last year's high court verdict that scrapped the appointments, ruling that Kejriwal could not have appointed them without concurrence from the Lieutenant Governor."

She is abroad for medical tests and treatment, said sources in her party, without divulging more information.

Mrs Gandhi, 70, left the country on Tuesday and is expected to return on the 22nd, subject to her doctors' advice. In 2011, she was allegedly operated on in the US, but her party refused to provide details of her condition, saying only that she was being treated in America. In August last year, she fell ill during a road show in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency of Varanasi, and was then hospitalized in Delhi, after which her attendance in parliament has been irregular.

Before flying out, she spoke to senior Congress leaders informing them of her plans; she stated that her son Rahul Gandhi, the Congress Vice President, will take decisions on her behalf.

Mr Gandhi, 46, is expected to chair an informal meeting tomorrow with Congress lawmakers tomorrow on their strategy for the parliament session that began today and runs till April 12.

If the Congress fails to check its trend of electoral defeats on Saturday, Mr Gandhi's leadership will be questioned afresh- he led the campaign for his party in Uttar Pradesh, where the Congress signed up as the junior partner of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - and there could be the now periodic calls for his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to take a bigger role in reviving the party which has been vastly attenuated in the last few years."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been camping in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi for three days since Saturday holding roadshows and election rallies. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who has forged an alliance with ruling Samajwadi Party for the assembly elections, conducted rallies with chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in the city. BSP chief Mayawati, who has been out of power for 5 years, had also launched a high-octane campaign in this key constituency.

She, in her speech, hit out at the BJP and Samajwadi Party-Congress on their campaign tactics and said, ""You can get the media limelight for a while with the crowds from outside, but they can't vote for you."" The 61-year-old leader is confident that Uttar Pradesh has decided to give her party majority votes. PM Modi's notes ban, she said, was a move to take people's attention off the key election issues. It created a huge dent and lakhs of people lost their jobs due to the ban of the high-value currency, BSP chief added.

Here are the highlights of Mayawati's speech:

On BJP, SP- Congress campaigns
 BJP and Samajwadi Party-Congress fighting for the second and the third place.In roadshows of both BJP and SP-Congress today in Varanasi, most of the crowd are onlookers.People have been called from neighbouring Bihar and Madhya Pradesh for the roadshows.You can get the media limelight for a while with the crowds, but they can't vote for you. The voters are here in front of me. (Mayawati hits out at BJP).The people of UP have made up their mind to give BSP a majority government.BSP is getting large amounts of votes in sixth phase.The BSP's government will also fulfil the dream of BR Ambedkar.The BJP and SP-Congress are making false claims about support in UP, shows their deceitful side.Don't vote for other parties, especially SP. You know the work that SP has done in UP and (PM) Modi at centre. Their wrong policy decisions has cost the states.The BJP can't muster the courage to name a Chief Minister candidate.SP is known as the government of 'jungle raj'.UP has to decide if it wants to vote for such a government or elect blemish-free face of the BSP.BJP had promised in 2014 to bring back black money and deposit 15 lakh in each person's bank account.
On PM's Constituency Varanasi
 Wherever you go in Varanasi there's dirt and filth. They have not even cleaned their mother Ganga.Whatever promises BJP had made, the PM had made, have not been fulfilled.Varanasi will punish them, the mother Ganga will punish them.Their theatrics of kinds has been exposed.
On Notes Ban
 PM's notes ban has caused a dent and people have not been able to recover from it. Lakhs have lost jobs.BJP, before banning the notes, they converted/managed money in UP for big industrialists. This has not been exposed in the media.This proves that notes ban was not only for their personal gains but also to take people's attention off key election issues.
On Backward Class Reservation
 The Dalit Rohit Vemula controversy is proof that BJP will work against the backward classes.The reservation that backward classes have got in the constitution is not because of the Congress but BR Ambedkar.Dalit and Adhivasis, after they got reservation, were not included in centre's list through false means and stripped off its benefits.The Mandal commission's recommendations on reservation were not applied by Congress government at the centre.In 1989 Lok Sabha elections, when Congress lost power and I was elected to Lok Sabha, BP Singh became the PM. He said BSP should also support us. I told him my two conditions. First, BR Ambedkar be awarded the Bharat Ratan posthumously and second, adopt the Mandal commission report.The BJP then staged mass protests against BR Ambedkar's Bharat Ratna and against reservations for backwards classes. I don't think UP will vote for such a party.BJP just before the elections chose a backward class leader as its state President to get votes.PM Modi is not from a backward class as he claims. He is an upper caste man. He had mischievously made the Mandal Committee include his caste in Other Backward Class category when he was Gujarat Chief Minister."

"UP Elections 2017: Rivals To Get 'Electric Shock' After UP Poll Results: PM Narendra Modi","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-rivals-to-get-electric-shock-after-up-poll-results-pm-narendra-modi-1665969","Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said BJP's rivals Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress will get ""electric shocks"" when the results of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are announced.

PM Modi's sharp riposte came in response to a remark by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who had asked him to touch an electric wire to see if current flows through it.

On the campaign trail, PM Modi has been attacking the Samajwadi Party government over ""poor"" power supply in the state and also controversially accused it of discrimination in its distribution along religious lines, a charge rubbished by the Chief Minister.

""On March 11, election results will give electric shock to SP, BSP and Congress,"" he said.

""Akhilesh has dared me to touch an electric wire to find out whether power is really there or not. His new friend Rahul Gandhi, during his 'khaat sabha' at Madihan in Mirzapur, however, had touched the wire and told his party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad that there was nothing to worry as there is no power in the line,"" PM Modi said.

""This is the acceptance of your new friend. Do I need touch the wires anymore? Akhilesh ji, now people have spread such a current that will give shocks to SP, BSP and Congress on March 11,"" he said.

Mr Gandhi had launched a 'khaat sabha' campaign, much before the Samajwadi Party and Congress got into an alliance for the state assembly election, where the Congress vice president would interact with the village folk seated on cots to understand their problems and find solutions. One 'khaat sabha' saw villagers run away with the cots after the meeting had ended.

PM Modi said people had run away with the cots as those belonged to them and they would now ensure the defeat of Congress."
"With PM Narendra Modi As Campaign Face, BJP Eyes Assam Redux In Manipur","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-pm-narendra-modi-as-campaign-face-bjp-eyes-assam-redux-in-manipur-1665047","Imphal, Manipur:                             As the two-phased Manipur assembly elections draw closer, campaigning in the state is at its peak. The BJP, which is hoping to replicate its Assam success in its second northeastern state, has pitched Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its face. BJP president Amit Shah will also try to promote Brand Modi in Manipur. The question is, whether the party can best Congress' master strategist and three-time Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh.

Last week, during PM Modi's rally in Imphal, a group of educated but unemployed Manipuri youth heard promises of jobs on merit. They had come from Thoubal, 30 km from Imphal, the stronghold of the Chief Minister.

""I gave many interviews, but never got a job,"" said 37-year-old Joychandra Singh, who did his Masters in rural development. He voted for Ibobi Singh all his life, but now, he says it's time for 'poriborton' (change) for him.

During his rally last week, PM Modi made a jibe at Ibobi Singh and asked his audience, ""Have you ever heard of a 10 per cent chief minister? Anywhere? Manipur now need zero per cent CM."" The PM had over seven lakh educated yet unemployed youth of Manipur and 55,000 first-time voters on mind.

""We want good roads, better transportation, good hospitals all over Manipur. We want zero corruption and we hope that a change in the form of BJP is going to be good,"" said first-time voter, Neoren Singh.

In the last 15 years of Ibobi Singh's rule, schools in Manipur have always failed to complete their calendar year due to frequent shutdowns and blockades. The last week witnessed protests by youth and students asking PM Modi to make the details of the 2015 Framework Agreement public.

""The centre needs to give details of the framework agreement with Nagas, mere assurances will not do. We don't want to lose our land to the Nagas,"" said M Swamikumar Singh, student from Imphal."
"UP Elections 2017: How The Battle For Uttar Pradesh Is Being Fought In PM Modi's Varanasi Today","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-with-an-elite-guest-list-who-will-take-centre-stage-in-varanasi-today-1666004","Varanasi: HighlightsBJP sets up camp, preps for PM Modi's visit to Varanasi
Apart from PM, Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati to address public
Varanasi with 5 assembly seats votes on March 8 in last phase of UP polls
                                If the finishing line makes athletes run faster and feel nervous, politics during elections is no different. With the last phase of polls in Uttar Pradesh just four days away, each political outfit is pulling out all the stops to steal the show in India's most populous state. All of Friday, the entire BJP machinery in Varanasi being led by top ministers displayed a bad case of nerves. A top minister refused attempts by a media crew to get a sound bite by saying, ""Please excuse me. Varanasi may vote on March 8 but our exam is on March 4. PM Modi is coming to Varanasi. He will not just address the rally and visit some temple. He is coming to his constituency and will visit the Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples. It's a visit which will send not a signal but signals.""

Bhupinder Yadav, the BJP general secretary who has been camping here for a week till all the votes come home on March 8, added to the drama with a cryptic comment that barely gave anything away. ""We are not saying that it will be a show of strength tomorrow. We are saying PM is coming for a darshan of voters of Varanasi and a darshan on Baba Vishwanath at Kashi temple,"" he said.

The BJP cadres here are agog - will the PM simply drive down from the landing zone in the Lanka area to Kashi and Bhairon temple and then for the second time for a rally at Town Hall ground? Or will he do something which will send a signal?

""We don't know what the Prime Minister plans. He is expected to travel in a cavalcade to the Kashi temple and then for rally. But will he emerge from the car - or will he turn it into a road show?"" wondered one party worker.

The district administration officials who are preparing for a day-long nightmare with PM's visit during the day say they have no request for a roadshow.

Yogeshwar Mishra, district magistrate of Varanasi, said, ""The programme of the Prime Minister includes a cavalcade drive. There is no information about any kind of roadshow.""

The BJP, which has a lot at stake in the last two phases of polling, had moved its war room to Varanasi several days ago entrusting Union Ministers and senior leaders with the task of strengthening the campaign with the Prime Minister in the front.

Top BJP leaders were deputed to work out and rehearse each element of the Prime Minister's visit. Power Minister Piyush Goyal visited the Kashi Vishwanath temple to check arrangements. The SPG or Special Protection Group and local police carried out a detailed drill. All the vehicles which will be part of the PM's cavalcade went over the route. At the temples, the parking formation as per guidelines was also carried out. Every building along the PM's route will get rooftop security men. And public buildings would be sanitised.
 UP elections 2017: BJP leaders discuss arrangements ahead of PM Modi's rally in Varanasi.At the Town Hall ground, the District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police checked the outer periphery, the barricading the adjoining buildings.

The officials have a tough task ahead. On one hand they have to ensure security for the PM who is coming for election campaigning plus two other political events. The face of the newly-forged Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi, will stage a nearly 10 km-long road show in Varanasi from the Kutchehry area. While Akhilesh Yadav, the Chief Minister, is protected by the National Security Guards, Rahul Gandhi is an SPG-protected leader with a high threat perception.

To match the BJP's effort, the SP-Congress combine has also shifted its focus to Varanasi. Congress campaign strategist Prashant Kishor and his team members are busy crafting Varanasi area-specific strategy. Videos titled 'Dead-e-Banaras' have been posted on the social media sites and Congress leaders say within a few days, the posts have recorded thousands of hits.

Political tension between various outfits is at its peak in the city over these two events as the Akhilesh-Rahul road show is expected to start after the Prime Minister has left Varanasi for a rally in adjoining Janupur and end before the PM returns for a rally in the Town Hall area. The administration has been constantly in touch with the SP-Congress and BJP leaders to ensure that channels created for movement of supporters are strictly adhered to.

The third big event of the day is a public meeting by BSP chief Mayawati in the Rohania area which, to the relief of the local administration, falls outside city limits. But Mayawati's party is known for limited rallies with high turnout. BSP leaders like Nasimuddin Siddiqui have been camping in Varanasi for the last five days to ensure a mega show. The worry for the administration is how to channel the BSP supporters who take trains to reach Varanasi and will be heading from the station to the rally site.

The District Senior Superintendent of Police Nitin Tiwari told NDTV, ""We have to ensure that all events don't overlap or there is no interface between their supporters. We are creating traffic diversions, vehicles for the events are being given specific routes and parking.""

Last time, the BJP and its current ally Apna Dal had won four while the Samajwadi Party had clinched one. The Saturday push by political parties is aimed at not just the 49 constituencies which will vote on March 8 but from the ancient city set by the Ganges, the parties also plan to send out s signal to voters of Phase 6 who would be reaching polling booths on the same day."

The Commission identified the papers as Sangai Express -- Manipuri and English editions -- Poknapham, People's Chronicle, Naharolgi, Thoudang, Imphal free press, Echel Express and Huiyen Lanpao.

While there is no bar on the publication of election advertisements 48 hours before the polling, a rule introduced by the Commission during the Bihar assembly polls says that such advertisements should be cleared by a certification committee.

It states that without approval no newspaper will publish such advertisements.

The new rule came after the BJP brought out some controversial advertisements during the Bihar elections."

In the run-up to the elections, all political parties in their campaigns mainly focused on the continuing economic blockade imposed by the United Naga Council and the state government's inability to break it. This invited corruption cases against some leaders in the state too. BJP leaders also levelled corruption charges against the Congress government and its inability to provide basic amenities to the people of the state, particularly the supply of potable water. The Congress countered, saying the government during its 15-year rule implemented several development projects and improved the power supply.

""The BJP has become the Number One party of the baagi and daagi candidates... this time they have not given tickets to people of their own cadre but to those who joined them after leaving other parties... tickets were given to rebels and with those having criminal antecedents,"" she told an election rally in Jaunpur.

""(Because of this) the cadres of the BJP will teach them a lesson in these elections,"" said Mayawati, who also addressed an election meeting in Mirzapur later.

 Claiming that her party will form government with full majority, Mayawati said people of the state will celebrate Holi of communal amity and brotherhood after elections.

Accusing the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of failing to fulfil the poll promises and checking the rising atrocities on dalits and backwards, the BSP chief said the saffron party was out to end reservation or make it ineffective as per the RSS' suggestions.

Making an appeal to the voters, especially Muslim, to vote for the BSP, Mayawati said it would keep the BJP out of power in the state. ""Voting for SP will only benefit the BJP,"" she said and promised that on coming to power she would end corruption, anarchy and the jungle raj of the Samajwadi Party and send criminals behind bars."

""Akhileshji ke pita Mulayam Singh ney purey jivan Congress ka virodh kiya par unhone pita ki kamaiee par paani pher diya (Mulayam opposed Congress all his life but Akhilesh ruined his father's work),"" Mr Singh said at an election meeting in Rasra.

""SP had realised that it is not strong enough to win the polls and so it shook hands with Congress, but Mulayam Singh Yadav has punctured the 'cycle' of SP and feuding uncle Shivpal has broken its chain...how will Akhilesh reach Lucknow on such a cycle with Rahul as the pillion rider?"" the Union Minister asked.

Seeking a response on development works, he claimed all of the Chief Minister's 'kaam' is speaking only in newspapers and TV and none of it is seen on the ground.

On Rahul Gandhi, the Union Minister said four months ago, the Congress leader had held meetings on 'khats' (cots), which are normally used for sleeping and not to hold meetings. Lamenting the political atmosphere in the state, Mr Singh said parties which talked about eradicating poverty and improving the lot of the poor were today honouring money over the hard work of people.

The Union Home Minister also spoke of terrorism and said Pakistan was facing the heat going by developments there in the past 10 days."

Assembly segments of Gorakhpur Lok Sabha constituency of firebrand BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, and Mau, where jailed gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari is in fray, also figure in this sixth and penultimate phase of polling.

The campaigning saw BJP state president KP Maurya likening rivals SP, Congress and BSP to different types of venomous ""snakes"" and ""social cancer"" and urging people to eliminate them by voting for the BJP.

 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav countered BJP saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi has conceded defeat in the polls by talking about a hung house.

While mustering votes for BJP, PM Modi sought to prove wrong the prophets of doom after demonetisation saying the latest GDP data showed note-ban did not affect growth rate but rather improved it.

""Hardwork, in fact, is much more powerful than Harvard,"" he said in an apparent dig at economists.

The prime minister also sounded highly optimistic of the poll outcome for BJP. ""Never have elections gone one way like this... there had been no dearth in enthusiasm of voters in all five phases,"" he said.

The PM also caught UP Chief Minister on the wrong foot and cited government website to nail him. ""Life in Uttar Pradesh is short and uncertain... Uttar Pradesh resembles Saharan Africa,"" PM Modi said quoting a para from the state government's official website up.gov.in.

He also ridiculed Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for his latest ""coconut juice"" remark. ""There is a Congress leader, and I want to pray for his long life... he recently went to Manipur to address an
election rally. There he told farmers that he would extract juice from coconuts and send it to London. In fact, a coconut possesses water (and not juice) and it is grown in Kerala,"" he said.

""It is like setting up a potato factory,"" PM Modi said referring to Rahul's earlier remarks that he wants to set up potato factories in Uttar Pradesh.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also hit out at the Prime Minister during his rally today. ""Modiji spoke about our 'karnama' but did not give any account of his work. He is shying away from debate on development. Actually, doing nothing is his biggest karnama,"" he said."

The Prime Minister was addressing public rallies in eastern UP, where the last two rounds of assembly elections will be held in the next few days.

""Akhilesh Yadav says his work speaks for itself... the UP government website admits life in UP is short and uncertain and that in this respect UP resembles Saharan Africa,"" the Prime Minister said. He wagered that, ""UP officers will face action as soon as I finish my speech.""

PM Modi has dug deep into the official website of the UP government to unearth tragic figures that are perfunctorily featured in a section on the state's economy. The ""short and uncertain"" reference is under health, where the state government says that women on an average live less than 55 years in UP and that the mortality rate for children under five years is a high 141 in every thousand. It makes the comparison to Saharan Africa and admits that ""If a girl is born in Kerala she can expect to live 20 years longer than if she is born in Uttar Pradesh.""

The UP government also says on its website, ""Almost all social indicators of the state show that the state stands on 13th or 14th position among the sixteen major states. Bihar and in some cases Orissa, are the only two states which lag behind UP in terms of social development indicators like medical facilities, teacher-pupil ratio in primary schools, birth rate, death rate, infant mortality rate, literacy, per capita income, electrification of villages, per capita power consumption etc.

The Prime Minister has in his election speeches lambasted the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party, who have ruled UP by turns in the last 15 years, for what he calls a total neglect of the development of the state and its people. The BJP, PM Modi said in Maharajgunj near Gorakhpur today, wants to work for the people of UP. ""When you look at India's map, you might have seen that when it comes to India and its development, it has to be holistic. Development has to be well-rounded.""

He accused the Akhilesh Yadav government of not spending central funds on development. ""1.5 crore people in UP don't have houses. Our government wanted the list of homeless people from the UP government but didn't get the list,"" the Prime Minister said, adding, ""This kind of government must be defeated.""

The BJP, the Prime Minister said, ""is leading till the 5th phase and the 6th and 7th phase will be bonus from you all."" The question, he said, was not who would form government, ""but whether the BJP will win a two-thirds majority or a three-fourths majority.

Five rounds of voting have been held in the UP assembly elections, seen as a semi-final before the national election in 2019. After two more rounds of polling, votes will be counted on March 11."

Manipur Election Watch and the ADR analysed 167 candidates who will try their luck in the first phase. Eight candidates were found to have assets over Rs 1 crore. The BJP has fielded four crorepati candidates - the most by any party. Two candidates contesting on Congress ticket were found to be crorepatis. The Democratic Front and the NCP has fielded 1 crorepati candidate each.

The campaigning for the first phase saw national leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh addressing multiple rallies throughout the state. During campaigning, there were bitter exchanges between the Congress and the BJP over the ongoing economic blockade in the state and the Naga Peace Accord.

The Naga Peace Accord was signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the Centre in August, 2015.

The economic blockade has led to shortage of essential commodities, especially fuel, in the land-locked state. The blockade in place since November 16, 2016 was imposed by the United Naga Council in protest against the state government's decision to carve out seven new districts from the existing ones.

Addressing the 'Varanasi Vyapari Sammelan' (traders meet), he hailed the Central government's demonetisation policy and said the move had won the confidence of many people.

""The demonetisation scheme was in the best interest of the countrymen. People residing in rural areas, who were once not our voters, voted for us this time due to this great step.

Our party courageously took the stand on demonetisation, which will make a positive impact on the economy of the country,"" he said.

""The world has accepted that India's economy is the fastest growing economy,"" he said.

Commenting on the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the senior BJP leader said, ""BJP is going to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh with full majority like it did at the Centre after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.""

He also hit out at the Opposition for targeting BJP for not having a chief ministerial face for the UP assembly elections.

Mr Jaitley pointed out that the electorate had chosen Narendra Modi, long before he was declared the Prime Minister nominee of BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

""During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the electorate of this country accepted Modiji first, afterwards our Bharatiya Janata party (workers) accepted him and at the end, our parliamentary board nominated him, and we even won the elections,"" he maintained.

""After 1984, it was for the first time that a political party got a clear majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls,"" he said, adding that history will be repeated in the UP elections.

Hitting out at the rival Congress, Mr Jaitley said the party was reduced to winning only 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as it ""only worked for its personal benefit, not for the nation.""

""Now BJP has become the pan India party,"" he asserted.

Mr Jaitley also attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for ""distributing tickets to criminal candidates, paving way for 'Goondaraj' (hooliganism) and doing caste-based politics.""

""Akhilesh boasts of one expressway in the state, while Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is constructing 255 highways at half the rate of the tender given by the UP government for its expressway,"" he added."

 The Congress accused the BJP of ""compromising with the
territorial integrity"" of Manipur, an allegation the saffron
party has vociferously denied.

The Naga Peace Accord, also called the ""framework agreement"", was signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the Centre in August, 2015.

The state has been saddled with an indefinite economic blockade since November 1, 2016, imposed by the United Naga Council, causing immense hardship to the people as the supply of essential commodities, especially fuel, in the land-locked state has choked.

The blockade has been imposed on Manipur's ""lifelines"" -- national highways 2 and 37, in protest against the state government's decision to carve out seven new districts from the existing ones.

The blockade has become a major poll plank in the north-eastern state.

The second and final phase of the Assembly polls is scheduled on March 8 and the results will be declared on March 11."
"Manipur Election 2017: The Complex Ethnic Arithmetic Holds The Key To The Poll Puzzle","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-election-2017-the-complex-ethnic-arithmetic-holds-the-key-to-the-poll-puzzle-1665973","Imphal, Manipur:                             As Manipur gets ready for the first of the two-phase Assembly election on Saturday, voting for 38 seats out of 60 will pave the way for the new government in the northeastern state. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally to BJP president Amit Shah's door-to-door campaign, the party is trying its best to replicate its sweep of Assam election last year. On the other hand, the election is billed as a major test for the Okram Ibobi Singh-led Congress government which has been in power in the state for the last 15 years. Thursday was the last day of campaigning for the first phase of the polls.

This has been a hectic poll season for Manipur with many star campaigners addressing multiple rallies. There were bitter exchanges between the Congress and the BJP over the ongoing economic blockade in the state and the Naga Peace Accord.

In the last 15 years of Ibobi Singh's rule, the state has seen many twists and turns. Frequent shutdowns and blockades have put the economic growth in the slow lane. The last week witnessed protests by youth and students asking PM Modi to make the details of the 2015 Framework Agreement public.  

""Before the election, they make lot of promises. But once they win, they don't work,"" said Sanatombi Devi, an Imphal resident.

Is BJP an alternative? Will it usher in the much-needed change? Voters aren't sure.

""The Congress party is not communal like BJP... we know Congress would not compromise with the Nagas and will safeguard integrity of the state,"" said Md Abdur Ali, resident of Lilong.

But poll arithmetic in Manipur is not that simple. Ethnic equations play a big role.

Meiteis form a major chunk of voters in 40 seats, Nagas in 20, Kukis and 30 other tribes are also decisive. The Congress split Naga-majority areas to create seven new districts. The Nagas protested the move. The centre's Framework Agreement with Nagaland's former insurgent group NSCN(IM) remains a key issue as Meities fear Manipur may lose their land to a probable Nagalim or umbrella Naga state.

While the Nagas accuse Congress of divisive politics, the Kukis don't want a rollback of the creation of new districts.

""If there is a rollback of the decision, the Kukis might hold protests,"" said S Kipgen, Kuki youth leader.

The second phase of the Assembly polls is scheduled on March 8 and the results will be declared on March 11."

Police said the bomb was found near the gate of a residential building around 6 AM in Khongman Bashikhong Turel Mapal area in Imphal East district. The bomb was later defused.

The bomb was recovered about 6 km from the venue where the Congress Vice President is scheduled to address a rally.

Rahul Gandhi will campaign for Congress candidates at Hapta Kangjeibung ground.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently held a rally in the state where he launched a blistering attack at the Congress government. ""Manipur has been destroyed, who's responsible... The chief minister here has been sitting in Manipur for 15 years. Manipur is considered as the Switzerland of East. But do you see any development, employment for youth?"" the PM had said during his rally in Imphal.

PM Modi also accused Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh of trying to divide the people of the state. ""There has been no work done. All the government has done is pit one community against the other and get benefit from it. This should end now. All communities spread across the state should be equally benefitted,"" he added.

Elections in the state are slated for March 4 and 8."

Addressing the 'Varanasi Vyapari Sammelan' (traders meet) in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency yesterday, he added that history will be created in the UP elections.

""After 1984, it was for the first time that a political party got a clear majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls,"" the senior leader said.

He also hailed the centre's demonetization policy and said the move had won the confidence of many people.

""The demonetisation scheme was in the best interest of the countrymen. People residing in rural areas, who were once not our voters, voted for us this time due to this great step. Our party courageously took the stand on demonetisation, which will make a positive impact on the economy of the country,"" Mr Jaitley said.

""The world has accepted that India's economy is the fastest growing economy,"" he added.

Commenting on the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the senior BJP leader said, ""BJP is going to form the next government in Uttar Pradesh with full majority like it did at the Centre after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.""

Mr Jaitley also hit out at the opposition for targeting BJP for not having a chief ministerial face for the UP assembly elections. Mr Jaitley pointed out that the electorate had chosen Mr Modi, long before he was declared the Prime Minister nominee of BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

""During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the electorate of this country accepted Modiji first, afterwards our Bharatiya Janata Party (workers) accepted him and at the end, our parliamentary board nominated him, and we even won the elections,"" he maintained.    

Hitting out at the rival Congress, Mr Jaitley said the party was reduced to winning only 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as it ""only worked for its personal benefit, not for the nation.""

""Now BJP has become the pan India party,"" he asserted.

Mr Jaitley also attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for ""distributing tickets to criminal candidates, paving way for Goondaraj (hooliganism) and doing caste-based politics.""

""Akhilesh boasts of one expressway in the state, while Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is constructing 255 highways at half the rate of the tender given by the UP government for its expressway,"" he added.

Former Goa RSS Sanghachalak Subhash Velingkar said a formal decision on the matter will be taken by 90-odd office-bearers of the faction by March 3 or 4.

""Re-uniting with the RSS after the February 4 assembly elections was always on the cards,"" Mr Velingkar told IANS. 

The aim of forming the rebel RSS unit in Goa was to defeat the state's BJP government which, he claimed, had taken the Sangh's teachings for granted.

Mr Velingkar was sacked by the RSS in August last year after he repeatedly accused Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and the Goa BJP of deviating from RSS teachings and betraying the cause of regional languages by allowing English medium primary schools -- most run by Goa's Roman Catholic Church -- to avail of financial grants. 

Mr Velingkar then formed a rebel Sangh outfit in Goa, which thousands of local volunteers and a majority of state RSS office-bearers joined.

Mr Velingkar, co-convenor of Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch, has accused Parrikar and the state BJP of betrayal.

Velingkar and the Manch leadership also formed a new political party -- Goa Suraksha Manch -- which contested the February 4 elections in alliance with the Shiv Sena and one of Goa's oldest regional political party -- Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party.

Velingkar said their rebellion had proved a point to the RSS top leadership and the Bharatiya Janata Party."

The state has already voted in five of the seven phases of the assembly elections, in which the party is hoping to wrest power from the ruling Samajwadi Party.

A BJP delegation led by Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi submitted a memorandum to the Election Commission, contending that there has been a large-scale deletion of names of genuine voters. This, the memorandum said, was a clear violation of the constitutional guarantees to citizens.

""The commission may institute an inquiry into such state-wide and unauthorised deletion of valid voters from the electoral rolls, fix responsibility and institute prosecution of officials responsible,"" the party said in the memorandum.

The BJP has claimed that it received complaints from almost every assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh that the names of voters have been deleted from the electoral lists without any advance warning.

The party also asked the Election Commission to ensure that all Electors Photo Identity Card holders be allowed to vote in the remaining two phases of the assembly polls. The phases 4 and 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections will be held on March 4 and March 8. The results will be declared on March 11.

Of the five states going to polls in this round - Punjab, Goa, Uttarkhand, Manipur and Uttar Pradesh - the election in the last is considered the most crucial. The 403-seat assembly happens to the largest and is considered a dress rehearsal before the 2019 general election.

"A Forgotten Village In Rahul Gandhi's Amethi Boycotts Election In Anger","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/a-forgotten-village-in-rahul-gandhis-amethi-boycotts-election-in-anger-1664397","Amethi, Uttar Pradesh:                             In Amethi, a VIP constituency courtesy Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who represents it in Parliament, the entire village of Parsauli in Uttar Pradesh did not vote in the assembly elections on Monday. They were protesting against the main road to the village not being repaired for decades.

All 649 voters in Parsauli, 339 men and 310 women boycotted the election in the fifth of seven rounds of polling. Polling booth number 120 saw not a single vote cast, officials said.

The villagers say they are bewildered at having been stricken off the map by their representatives. Parsauli is only three km away from Amethi town on the Amethi-Durgapur highway, but has had no proper road linking it for many years.

Two powerful politicians represent it - while Mr Gandhi is the member of parliament, the legislator is Gayatri Prajapati, an influential minister in the Samajwadi Party of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

KN Sharma, a retired station master of the Indian Railways, who lives in Parsauli, told news agency Press Trust of India that the road that connects the village with the highway was constructed when the Congress' Sanjay Gandhi was the MP from Amethi.

There has been no attempt to repair it since and there is simply no road left. Sanjay Gandhi, Rahul's uncle, died 37 years ago in 1980.

The BJP has accused Rahul Gandhi of neglecting Amethi, which has been a Gandhi family stronghold for years. The Gandhis - including party chief Sonia Gandhi who is Rahul's mother - have accused the BJP-led central government of punishing voters in Amethi and adjoining Rae Bareli by withholding the benefits of central schemes from them.

In the national election in 2014, only two constituencies out of UP's 80 had voted in Congress MPs - Amethi and Rae Bareli elected Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The BJP won 72 seats and Akhilesh Yadav's party had won 5.

For the UP assembly elections the Congress has partnered with the Samajwadi Party but both parties fielded candidates in the Amethi assembly seat after the Congress' Ameeta Singh insisted on contesting.

The BJP turned it into an even more high profile contest, fielding Garima Singh as its candidate. Garima Singh is the ex-wife of Sanjay Singh, locally known as the Raja or King of Amethi. Ameeta Singh is married to him now.

The Samajwadi Party has fielded its sitting legislator Mr Prajapati, against whom a first information report or FIR was registered last week in a rape case.             

85-year-old Maharajdin Yadav of Parsauli said he couldn't care less. ""No one does anything. People come and go, you think they are all blind?"" he asked angrily.

It's not just one village. Many voters complain about the lack of proper irrigation and a lack of good schools and colleges. Amethi's maternal mortality or mothers who die while giving birth, a key health indicator, is 364 per 1 lakh live births, far more than the state average of  285.

The Congress Ameeta Singh argues with the numbers. ""It is wrong to say Amethi is underdeveloped. No constituency can claim 100 per cent development but we are trying,"" she said."

A delegation of the Congress party, led by AICC general secretary Ambika Soni and Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, and other leaders also demanded an investigation into the alleged pumping of crores of rupees into the state election.

It urged the Commission to ensure that no postal votes cast after the designated time of 5.00pm in the Uttarakhand Assembly polls on February 15 be counted.

""We would like to submit that breach of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was committed by Narendra Modi ji himself, amongst others, and an FIR should be filed against the perpetrator amongst others,"" the delegation said in a memorandum submitted to the poll body.

The delegation maintained that the EC should immediately instruct the State Election Commission to file an FIR against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, J P Nadda, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank (MP), Madan Kaushik (local candidate) and other BJP leaders and party candidates who addressed/participated in the election rally for alleged ""breach of MCC which can be clearly seen from the material available in public domain"".

""The EC should also launch a probe into the pumping of huge amount of unaccounted cash during election by the BJP. Besides, the poll body should ensure that no postal votes be counted, which were cast after the designated time of 5.00pm on 15.2.2017,"" the memorandum stated.

Ms Soni and Mr Rawat told the Commission that during the election campaigning in Uttarakhand, Mr Modi held a public rally in Haridwar on February 10, without the requisite permission from the poll watchdog and thus violated the MCC.

They said, on bringing the matter to the notice of Chief Election Officer of Uttarakhand and other authorities, a showcause notice was issued and since the ""BJP had failed to convince the EC through its reply, the commission had filed an FIR against the Haridwar Unit of BJP."""

PM Modi has vowed to end the blockade which has crippled the state's transport and supply lines for over 4 months if voted to power.

"UP Elections 2017: State's 'Achhe Din' Will Begin From 1 PM On March 11, Says BJP Chief Amit Shah","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-states-achhe-din-will-begin-from-1-pm-on-march-11-says-bjp-chief-amit-shah-1665989","Varanasi:                             A day ahead of the sixth phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, BJP President Amit Shah on Friday claimed his party has ""won"" a majority in the previous phases and the state's 'achhe din' will begin from March 11, the day of counting of votes.

He also blamed Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for letting absconding minister and rape-accused Gayatri Prajapati letting go scot-free, calling it a worst example of poor law and order. Asked if the results will be seen as people's response to the PM Narendra Modi government's work, he said they would put their stamp of approval on its two-and-a-half-year tenure in these elections.

""The BJP has already won a majority of seats in the state assembly in the first five phases of the polls. In the next two, people will push our tally to two-thirds mark. I can say with confidence that we will get two-thirds seats,"" he said.

Mr Shah rejected the suggestion of an intensive campaign by Prime Minister Modi in Varanasi and neighbouring places and the fact that the top party brass has been camping here for days were a sign of nervousness in the saffron camp.

Wherever elections have taken place in the earlier phases, the party and its leaders have focused on campaigning and it is natural that they are in Varanasi now as it goes to the polls in the last phase, he said.

The state is seeing a similar wave in the BJP's support that was witnessed during the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 when it won 71 of the 80 seats, he claimed. Responding to Mr Yadav's barb at the BJP over its 'achhe din' (good days) claim for the country, he said, ""The 'achhe din' of Uttar Pradesh will begin from 1 P M on March 11 when the counting of votes will occur and the BJP will emerge victorious."""
"UP Elections 2017: PM Narendra Modi's Varanasi Is Ground Zero In Final Push For State","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modis-varanasi-is-ground-zero-in-final-push-for-uttar-pradesh-1664792","Varanasi: HighlightsIn last leg of UP polls, all parties plan to carpet bomb Varanasi
PM Modi will be in his constituency,Varanasi, on March 5 for rallies
Varanasi votes on March 8; counting for all rounds on March 11
                                It is destination Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as parties gear up for the last two rounds of polling in the marathon Uttar Pradesh assembly election. The elections are now in the eastern part of the massive state and polling will be held for 89 seats in 14 districts on March 4 and 8.

Over the next few days, political parties plan to carpet bomb Varanasi and adjoining areas and Saturday, March 4, will be a logistics nightmare for the local administration. PM Modi will campaign that day in his constituency while another part of UP votes, as will the Akhilesh Yadav-Rahul Gandhi team and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati.

The BJP, which hopes to replicate its sweep of UP in the 2014 national elections, has moved its entire brass to eastern UP, where it has been forced to counter a rebellion by supporters of powerful local leader and priest Yogi Adityanath. They are upset that he has not been named the party's presumptive chief minister. The UP elections are seen as a bellwether for the next general elections in 2019.

PM Modi may turn his constituency into an operational base from March 3, sources said. Already camped in the region are union minister Rajnath Singh, BJP chief Amit Shah and other top central ministers. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will pass through on Sunday, on his way to Nepal for a meeting.  

On March 3, PM Modi will address a rally in Mirzapur, about 60 km away from Varanasi. The next day, he will campaign in Jaunpur, before returning to Varanasi where he will address a public meeting at Kashi Vidyapeeth. He may also visit the famous Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav temples.

On the same day, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party will hold a 13-km road show along with his partner and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi. Starting at 1 pm, they will travel through Varanasi's Kutchehry (court) area to Lanka, where the famous Benaras Hindu University or BHU is located, covering all three assembly segments in Varanasi city.

The Samajwadi Party also plans two public meetings in Varanasi to be addressed by Akhilesh Yadav one at Allahabad road in Varanasi and the other Ajgara before the road show.

District administration is trying to ensure that the road show and PM rally crowds get different channels for movement.

Ms Mayawati will address a public rally in Varanasi on the same day at Rohania, which much to the relief of the district administration is far from the Varanasi city and may not clash with the BJP and SP-Congress events.

With three top formations holding show of strengths on the same day, each party will make an effort to outdo the others on crowd size and thousands, even lakhs, of political workers and supporters will be out in the narrow lanes of the ancient city at the same time.  

Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Yadav from Bihar has been in Varanasi for the last two days and addressed two rallies yesterday. He may address another today, appealing for votes for Akhilesh Yadav.

Varanasi votes in the seventh and final phase and on the last day of campaigning, Amit shah will hold a road show here. PM Modi will be in Varanasi on March 5 for rallies in Pindra and Ajgara. He may spend the night in Varanasi.

Votes for all rounds of the UP elections and polling held in four other states will be counted on March 11."

"UP Elections 2017: What's In A Name? In Harijanpur, Opinion Is Divided","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-whats-in-a-name-in-harijanpur-opinion-is-divided-1662466","Harijanpur village, Chitrakoot:                             If caste equations play a dominant role in Uttar Pradesh politics, on the ground, its reflection can be seen in villages like Harijanpur. Blatantly named after castes or groupings of their residents, such villages can be found in every corner of the state. Harijanpur -- 20 km on an extremely bad road from Chitrakoot's Manikpur block and home to 530 Dalit voters -- is all set for Thursday's vote, in which they have been promised much, but not a change of name.

For villagers like Kalavati, this is the ultimate stamp of shame. ""Ghrina aati hai,"" said the 60-year-old widow, seated in a neighbour's house. The words loosely translate to feeling disgusted with the name of her village. Kalavati says she wants an immediate change - involving the removal of the word ""Harijan"".

Once popularised by Mahatma Gandhi in his fight against untouchability, the word is now considered derogatory. ""I don't like this name. If it got changed, I could go into society with more dignity,"" she said.

Sitting nearby, 50-year-old farmer Ramakant chips in: ""Earlier, we raised this name change demand and this was converted into a Ambedkar gram in Mayawati's tenure. That scheme lasted for three years and that's the only time we saw any development,"" he says.

At the village well, scores of women can be seen with a list of demands usual in this part of the country which is drought hit and impoverished. Their three key demands are a decent road, irrigation for crops and employment.

Further ahead in the village, we meet Ashish and Arjun, both in their early 20s, who say forget names, the biggest issue here is migration. Ashish has just returned from a factory in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar, Arjun from Jaipur. Local-level employment, they say, is the big issue. Not the name of the village.

""When I go out, I just say I'm from Chitrakoot. That's how we are identified anyway,"" says Arjun. ""I think the impact of caste is coming down in our society,"" adds Ashish.

Asked about the only political presence in the village -- a Mayawati sticker pasted outside a thatched hut - he said, ""We will vote for the person who works and does some good for us""."
"UP Polls 2017: Prannoy Roy On Why 'New Voters' Of 2014 Are Essential For BJP","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-polls-2017-prannoy-roy-on-why-new-voters-of-2014-are-essential-for-bjp-1663260","Lucknow:                             India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh is more than halfway through the 2017 Assembly Elections - seen as the bellwether for the general elections two years later. The critical question for the election is whether the BJP - which swept the state in the 2014 general elections - will be able to repeat the success or if the Samajwadi Party - which has tied up this year with the Congress - be able to script a sequel to its 2012 state poll landslide. As both the top ambassadors for the election - Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav - claim to be working towards moulding the election narrative towards development, it remains to be seen how much of the politics in the battleground state is still influenced by religion and caste. NDTV's Prannoy Roy and election experts analyse what it will take for the parties to win the prized battle in the state seen as most critical to India's political discourse.

Demonetisation or the central government's move to ban large notes in a bid to curb corruption and tax evasion, a real pain a few months ago, has eased, says senior journalist Shekhar Gupta. But as much as people vote on economic issues, caste remains an undeniably key factor in UP elections.

Here's a look at how different castes voted in 2014 Lok Sabha and 2012 Assembly elections:


Caste still influences political allegiances in Uttar Pradesh, shows a ground survey in the state. But the other factor that affects which party gets the mandate is the age of the voter.

Akhilesh Yadav who swept the 2012 election will need to rely greatly on the young vote once again if he is to make a return. The question is, will the youth factor work for Akhilesh Yadav?


But for the BJP, it will be 'new voters' and a focus on vote banks that will be key to win the 2017 Assembly Elections:


On the campaign trail, NDTV spoke to BJP's Rajnath Singh - one of the party's tallest leaders in the state.
 
The Union Home Minister says the BJP did not select Muslim candidates because winnability is a factor. ""A confusion has been created in the minds of minorities about us. That will go with time,"" he says.

But will the fact that the BJP has not declared a Chief Ministerial candidate will it hurt the party? No, says Mr Singh. Would he like to be chief minister? ""Humko kaun poochh raha hai? (Who's asking me?)"" said the 65-year-old BJP leader.

And what about politics of polarisation? Are party chief Amit Shah's and PM Narendra Modi's latest speeches invoking Diwali, Eid a deviation from the party's 'development agenda'? ""No. The attempt is never to polarise. I read the PM's speech carefully. It was all about ending appeasement and discrimination,"" Mr Singh said.

On the fight against black money, one of the BJP's foremost election issues, Rajnath Singh seemed to duck a direct question if the use of unaccounted wealth had been curbed. ""But at least our government has taken a step in that direction, even if its a centimetre,"" he said.

As much as the election is a prestige battle for PM Narendra Modi, it is also for Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. To retain power, the Samajwadi Party, which has allied with the Congress this time, must win back 'traditional voters' it lost to BJP in 2014 elections:


Mulayam Singh had an incredible ability to bring together figureheads from different communities to the Samajwadi Party's advantage. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav however has a different style.
 ""We respect the Prime Minister. He has gone from Uttar Pradesh. But he says too many small things. MODI to us stands for Model of Dividing India. And he hasn't done anything for the people,"" says Mr Yadav.

On his feud with his father Mulayam Singh and uncle Shivpal Yadav, which divided the party just ahead of the polls, he said, ""This is Netaji's (Mulayam Singh) party. He is our mentor. After results on March 11, whatever decision he takes, will be final.""

The third contender for power in Uttar Pradesh, BSP, is focusing on forward caste and Muslim voters to make a comeback:

The BSP has the toughest of climbs. If Mayawati's party does end up being the No. 3 outfit, will she ally with her archenemy Samajwadi Party or the BJP? That may be the biggest plot twist in the end."
"UP Election 2017: Fifth Phase Candidate Include 168 Crorepatis, 117 With Criminal Cases","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-election-2017-fifth-phase-candidate-include-168-crorepatis-117-with-criminal-cases-1663163","New Delhi:                             In phase five of Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections on Monday, a total of 168 crorepati candidates are contesting and 117 have declared criminal cases against themselves, a report released on Friday said.

"'The Snake Of Victory': How To Win Uttar Pradesh This Year","http://www.ndtv.com/elections-news/the-snake-of-victory-how-to-win-uttar-pradesh-this-year-1662872","Lucknow:                             The Uttar Pradesh ""snake of victory"" shows that a party or coalition will need 35 per cent of the total votes to get a majority in the state, where assembly elections are being held in seven phases. Majority in the 403-member UP assembly is 202 seats.

In 2012, when the Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav rode a wave to victory, his party had needed far less, 29 per cent vote share, to win 226 seats. Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party or BSP with 26 per cent votes could win just 80 seats. In many seats that the Samajwadi Party had won, the difference between its candidate and the number 2, mostly the BSP candidate, was less than 1 per cent.

But that year, the two regional giants were the primary actors in UP, with national parties the BJP and the Congress coming in a distant third and fourth.
 Two years later, in 2014, the BJP flipped UP's politics over with a Modi wave, sweeping 73 of the state's 80 parliament seats along with ally Apna Dal - 71 on its own - equal to 337 assembly seats. Its vote share, a whopping 43 per cent.

The party hopes to replicate that in the assembly elections this year and end a 15-year drought in UP.
 The Samajwadi Party's 22 per cent vote share in 2014 earned it five seats - equal to 42 assembly seats. The Congress' eight per cent vote share got it two Lok Sabha seats, that of party chief Sonia Gandhi and her son and deputy Rahul Gandhi - equal to 15 assembly seats.   

This time the Samajwadi Party has partnered with the Congress in a bid to consolidate their overlapping vote banks - like the Muslim vote - and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said he expects the coalition to win 300 seats. It will need upwards of 40 per cent vote share for that in what is seen as a close three-cornered election.

For the BJP to win in 2017, it will need to hold on to the new voters it acquired in 2014, most prominently the Jat vote. Traditionally 10 per cent Jats, concentrated in western UP, have voted for the BJP. But in the deeply polarised national elections, held months after deadly communal violence between Jats and Muslims in 2013, 75 per cent Jats voted for the BJP.
 The BJP also got 75 per cent of the forward caste vote; traditionally 40 per cent of UP's forward caste voters have voted for the party. It also benefited from extra votes from non-Jatav Dalit voters and non-Yadav voters from Other Backward Castes or OBCs.

"BJP leader In Goa Shot Dead Man In 2006, Claims Ex-Driver","http://www.ndtv.com/goa-news/bjp-leader-in-goa-shot-dead-man-in-2006-claims-ex-driver-1661644","Panaji:                             A BJP leader who contested the Goa assembly polls held on February 4 has been named in a murder case in 2006. Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane's name emerged in a video in which his former driver claims to have witnessed the BJP leader shooting dead a man. The driver was detained by police after the video went viral on social media.

""Witness Pandurang Adarkar who is from Kolhapur in Maharashtra has been detained. He has confessed to being witness to the murder of one Shanu Gaonkar, who is missing since 2006,"" inspector Dipak Pednekar was quoted by news agency PTI.

In the video that has gone viral, Mr Adarkar purportedly claimed he was witness to Mr Rane shooting Mr Gaonkar dead in Sattari tehsil of Goa in 2006 to avenge the killing of his brother Prithviraj Rane.

 Prithviraj Rane was murdered at Saleli village of Sattari tehsil in 2005.

Preliminary inquiry had begun under the supervision of Superintendent of Police Karthik Kashyap, the inspector told PTI.

Police have not arrested anyone in connection with the case, but claim that the statements of all the people named by Mr Adarkar would be recorded. The police officer, however, ruled out questioning Mr Rane at this juncture.

Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane has not responded to the allegation levelled against him.

Mr Rane contested against Congress' Pratapsinh Rane from Poriem constituency during the assembly elections held earlier this month. A high voter turnout of over 83 per cent was recorded in the Assembly polls in Goa, which were held on February 4. The ruling BJP is engaged in a fierce fight with the Opposition Congress, AAP and an alliance of MGP, Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch for the 40-member House.

""BJP says 'Ka' stands for Congress. Your Akhilesh bhaiyya says 'Ka' (in Hindi) stands for Computer, 'Sa' stands for smartphone, through which you can get all the information about the policies of the government and 'B' stands for 'bachche' (children),"" Dimple, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said at an election rally amid loud applause.

The ruling Samajwadi Party has a scheme to distribute laptops to meritorious students and promised to give smartphones if it returns to power in the state.

Mr Shah at a rally last week at Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur had used the 'KASAB' acronym to describe 'Ka' for Congress, 'Sa' for SP and 'B' for BSP.

Mr Shah coined the acronym matching the name of terrorist Ajmal Kasab - one of the perpetrators of 26/11 Mumbai attack.

Akhilesh had earlier hit out at the BJP chief for his ""Kasab"" barb, saying ""Ka"" actually stood for ""kabutar"" (pigeon), while BSP supremo Mayawati had said, ""There cannot be a bigger Kasab than him"" and dubbed Shah a ""terrorist"".

Dimple said SP would give 35 per cent reservation to women, and pregnant women would get foodgrains delivered at their doorstep.

""If SP is voted to power, we will do away with the age-limit for women in Class-III and IV government jobs,"" she said.

The Kannauj MP also said that for every gas stove purchased, her party would give a pressure cooker.

Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said, ""The people of the country while listening to PM's 'Mann ki Baat' have not realised how the prices of LPG cylinders have gone up""."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Manipur tomorrow to address a public gathering ahead of the assembly election in the state. The Coordinating Committee said that the curfew shall remain effective till Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves Imphal after his electioneering.

Police said that security measures have been heightened to ensure that there is no law and order problem during PM Modi's hour-long visit. A statement issued by the Corcom has levelled serious charges against the government, including accusing it of driving a wedge between communities who have been living in peace and harmony for generations.

Local residents have been told not to venture out during the curfew. However media and those in essential services will be exempt. Police said, ""During such curfews people usually stay indoors and do not stick out their necks."" There has always been a thin attendance at public functions, they said.

To ensure that the insurgents-led boycott is not taken lightly by locals, at times some stray incidents of violence takes place to discourage people.

The ruling Congress party has been saying in their election meetings, that during his visit, PM Modi should spell out the details of the agreement he signed with militant organisation NSCN(IM). Students and women activists have been demanding the disclosure of the details of the agreement, they said."
"NSCN(IM) Claims Centre Has Recognised Legal Rights On 'Naga Integration'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nscn-im-claims-centre-has-recognised-legal-rights-on-naga-integration-1663299","Guwahati, Assam:                             In what might create political ripples ahead of assembly elections in Manipur next week, the Naga rebel group NSCN(IM), which has signed a Framework Agreement with the centre for the Naga peace deal, on Friday claimed that the centre has recognised the legal rights of the Nagas and proclaimed “integration the legitimate rights of the Nagas.” 

The NSCN(IM), in a press statement, also claimed that there will be a transformation in the history of the Naga very soon.

The framework agreement inked between the centre and the NSCN(IM) is a key election issue in Manipur.

 NSCN(IM) has also claimed that there are some individuals trying to sabotage the peace talks between them and the central government by projecting a new means as “Nagas of Nagaland”.

The ruling Congress in Manipur has been claiming that the BJP is hand in gloves with NSCN(IM) and United Naga Council or UNC and they are the architect of the economic blockade, which has been on for nearly four months. To counter this campaign, last week Home Minister Rajnath Singh claimed at a poll rally in Imphal that there is ‘no mention of Manipur’ in the framework agreement since August 2015. 

Various student and civil society groups in Imphal valley have been demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi disclose the clauses of the framework agreement signed in August 2015 with the NSCN(IM). 

The Congress’s main campaign has been on protecting Manipur's territorial integrity against the concept of greater Nagalim (Integration of Naga areas in Northeast). 

The statement by NSCN(IM) came a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first election rally in Imphal. Manipur will go to polls in two phases on March 4 and 8 for its 60 member legislative assembly. While the Congress has been in power for 15 years, the BJP has gained ground and emerged as the main opposition party to the Congress in this election with several Congress leaders switching to the BJP camp. Votes will be counted on March 11."

"UP Elections 2017: Volunteers Fan Out With Personal Letter From Akhilesh Yadav","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-volunteers-fan-out-with-personal-letter-from-akhilesh-yadav-1663280","Lucknow:                             As leaders of all major parties are channelising their energies in campaigning for the last three phases of polling in Uttar Pradesh, an army of volunteers from SP and Congress is reaching out to voters with a personal letter from Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

Armed with campaign material and dressed in white T-shirts that read 'phir se Akhilesh' and 'UP ko ye saath pasand hai', these volunteers are reaching out to voters and households across the districts which are slated to go to polls.

The volunteers carry with them the alliances' 10 key priorities - Pragati ke Das Kadam, pictures of Akhilesh and Rahul with the 'UP ko yeh saath pasand hai' slogan and a pocket calendar, besides a personalised message from Akhilesh Yadav.

Said to be the brainchild of Congress' election strategist Prashant Kishor's team, around 70-100 volunteers per assembly constituency visit upto 5 lakh homes daily, in a bid to give a personal touch to the electioneering.

Elections for UP Legislative Assembly are being held in seven phases with three more to follow on February 27, March 4 and 8. The results will be out on March 11.

Interestingly, the letter signed by Mr Yadav is printed on a sheet of paper which has a band of SP and Congress colours running across it. In the letter, the Chief Minister expresses confidence that people would give him a second chance for taking forward the work initiated by his government.

""We initiated several works in the past five years for development and also got success in many schemes but there still remains a long way to go...a big structure has to be built on the foundations laid and it is important that this vikas ki yatra is not slowed down,"" he states in the letter titled 'Akhilesh ka sandesh'.

""We want to bring the state in the category of most developed states for which works have been done speedingly and now we have also got the support of Congress and Rahulji which will give it more momentum,"" Mr Yadav has stated adding he has confidence that people will support the alliance."
"Manipur Election 2017: Will State Replicate 'Arunachal Model', Voters Wonder","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-election-2017-will-the-state-walk-in-arunachal-pradeshs-footsteps-1663460","Imphal:                             Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Imphal, the Congress said that PM Modi will have no impact in Manipur whereas the BJP is confident that he will bring down the curtains on the Congress' 15-year rule in the state.

The BJP, which is contesting all 60 constituencies, has never fought Manipur so seriously. It is fighting the election, scheduled for March 4, without an alliance with the regional parties, who are its allies outside Manipur. Former Congress minister N Biren, who recently joined the BJP, said the party will sweep the polls.

""We are not having any pre-poll alliance. That can be considered post-poll. If they want to join, they are most welcome,"" said Mr Biren.

But both sides, BJP and Congress, have a common worry: narrow wins or even a hung assembly and that has, suddenly, put the phrase, 'The Arunachal Model',  on everyone's lips.

Last year, Arunachal Pradesh saw at least three different chief ministers, many more ministers and legislators change party colours at the speed of light. The BJP, now, runs the state.

""No place for the push and pull of the Arunachal model. We will have a single majority,"" Mr Biren said.

Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh said the BJP does not have a chance and there is no question of replicating the Arunachal Pradesh model in Manipur.

""Manipur is not Arunachal... They will not succeed. Yes, six MLAs have quit. But those who have defected, they are suicidal. Their career is finished,"" said Mr Singh.

Manipuris, trying to do the math, see uncertain times ahead.

""It will be a hung Assembly and then, the party in power at the Centre will have an influence here,"" said Pradip Phanjoubam, editor of the Imphal Free Press.

""Defections and difficulties of rounding up MLAs from smaller parties could make things difficult for Congress,"" he added.

The Congress lost Assam to BJP after a 15-year stint. In Manipur, however, it may be a tougher nut to crack. But that, itself, may push the state into Arunachal Pradesh's footstep."
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Promises To End Economic Blockade In Manipur: Highlights","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-prime-minister-narendra-modi-speech-at-rally-in-manipurs-imphal-1663372","Imphal:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a public meeting in Manipur's capital Imphal. Polls for the 60-member legislative assembly of the northeastern state will be held in two phases on March 4 and March 8. The election is expected to be a high-octane, virtual contest between the ruling Congress - which has ruled the state for 15 years - and the BJP. Over the last six months, many senior Congress members, including ministers, have shifted their allegiance to the BJP. However, the BJP is contesting the polls without its key regional allies National People's Party, Naga People's Front and the Lok Janshakti Party, who are all contesting the election separately.

Insurgents in the state have called for a curfew from 6 am on Saturday, ahead of the Prime Minister's scheduled visit. Situation is Manipur has been tense ever since the United Naga Council imposed an economic blockade, which has affected daily life of voters.

Here are the highlights of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech:Today, the first thing I want do is make a complaint. Will you be offended?When, in 2014, I came here before the Lok Sabha elections, the ground was not full. Today, it is full of people.I can't complain but only thank you for the love.Manipur has been coloured with the colours of the BJP. In a few days, there will be celebrations.The chief minister here has been sitting in Manipur for 15 years.Manipur is considered as the Switzerland of East. But do you see any development, employment for youth?Manipur has been destroyed, who's responsible? (People chant, ""Congress"")The Congress which has so many sins, does it have any right to be in power for even a day? Will you wipe them completely this time?There has been no work done. All the Congress government has done is pit one community against the other and get benefit from it.This should end now.All communities spread across the state should equally benefit.I urge you to let BJP serve the people of Manipur. Just give us 5 years; you have given them 15 years. In 15 months, we'll do what they haven't.Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made a separate ministry for the north-eastern states.Then the next 10 years, there was such a government in Delhi that it destroyed all the progress. They just thought of the number of MPs from the state.The question is not about number of MPs. It's about giving my brothers and sisters who live far away from Delhi an equal opportunity.Any Chief Minister from the north-east who wants to meet me is always welcome.When there's a NSC meeting, our minister stays here to find a solution.When Morarji Desai was the Prime Minister, he came for an NSC meeting. I was the first prime minister after 40 years who came here for the meeting.Look at Sikkim: it's developing at a fast pace. But wherever there is Congress, no state is developing.Manipur has one of the worst figures of people below poverty line.Jobs have been categorized according to different rates. If you want to be a teacher - pay a certain amount; same for being a cop or a chef at a minister's house. How is this allowed to go on?The Congress in Manipur does not want to light the bulbs in your house. They think if there's electricity, the people will buy TVs which will give news of the money sent to the state and not spent on its people.Even when the Centre gives them electricity, they have no intention to develop the state.Youth from Manipur and northeast have been working to safeguard Delhi. This is an example of their strength. I have urged to have northeastern people recruited in the security forces to show the country their strength.When, at 8 pm on November 8, I demonetised 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, Congress leaders were startled. They couldn't fathom the consequences.The money that they have looted, I will take it back and use it for the development of the people.These people don't care about cultures in India or the nation but just their seats.People talk about the accord with the Nagas. I want to ask the state government, were you sleeping for 1.5 years? We had informed about the accord with all details a year and a half ago. Now when the elections have been announced, they are spreading rallies.I, standing on the holy land of Manipur, promise you that there's not even one word in any accord which is against the interests of Manipuris.Isn't it the state government's responsibility to provide essential commodities such as sugar and salt, medicines and pulses?Still there are protests on the streets. People don't have grains. What kind of a government is that?Results of polls will be announced on March 11. The country will celebrate Holi on March 13. I promise you I will not let any blockade stop the celebration.Why shouldn't the blockades be removed? Why shouldn't there be a police case against rioters? I urge the people to remove the blockade today and we will help them to resolve all issues.You (Congress) had your way in Manipur because your government was in Delhi. Now you will have to give account of everything because there's Modi sitting in Delhi now.Manipur has done well in sports. Manipur is strong. We sent money for sports facilities but the chief minister here..No chief minister is talked about in percentage. What's this 10 per cent I asked the people of Manipur? They told me Modi ji you are honest; you won't understand this easily.Manipur now needs a zero per cent CM.We want to make Manipur an organic state. We want to give 24-hour electricity to all households. Congress will not let this happen. The people of Manipur will be made to live in darkness. We have to change this.They (Congress) wants vote for their 10 per cent commission. We want vote for 100 per cent development.We want to give: Kissano ko Sichai, Bachchon ko Parhai, Naujavanon ko Kamai, Aur burhon ko Davai. (Irrigation for farmers, education for children, employment for youth and medicines for the old)We took 800 crucial medicines and made them cheaper, from 3,000 to 300 and from 80 to 12 rupees. Didn't the people of lower economic strata benefit?When someone has a pain in chest, they rush to the doctor. The doctor tells them they need a stent. They give you two choices: one that costs 45,000 rupees and will give you up to six years of life, or the other which costs 1,30,000 will stay for a lifetime. So the poor are forced to choose. How can poor get 1 lakh plus?I called the manufacturers to reduce the cost of these stents to Rs 7,000 from 45,000 and Rs 25,000 from 1,30,000.Everything has rates - money is needed to get a job, needed to get a college seat.Son tells his mother that I need 2 lakh to get a degree which will get me a job. Mother says I will mortgage the house, the jewellery.Three babus for the interview and ask questions as a formality. They take money to give jobs. I have finished this process. Jobs for grade 3 and grade 4 will now be given on merit basis.They said we will give 12 subsidised cylinders from nine and it was an issue. We did our research and figured that people were black marketing.We gave free gas connections to people and saved the old mothers from the smoke of 400 cigarettes coming out from wood burning chulhas.This should be the aim of development. To save the poor and first give them the basics.Give BJP a chance for 5 years."

"Terrorists Fire At Security Forces Ahead Of Manipur Deputy Chief Minister's Campaign","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/terrorists-fire-at-security-forces-ahead-of-manipur-deputy-chief-ministers-campaign-1662049","Guwahati, Assam:                             Even as the campaigning for the two-phased polls for the 60 seats of Manipur legislative assembly gathers momentum, the terrorists in the hilly areas of the state have become more active. Today, the terrorists tried to disrupt the campaigning of Manipur Deputy Chief Minister and Congress candidate from Nungba constituency G Gaikhangam twice by opening fire - one security personnel was injured.

According to Manipur police sources, terrorists today ambushed an advance security team which was on its way to make free passage for the VIPs and VVIPs who were attending the flag hoisting ceremony of Deputy Chief Minister G Gaikhangam at his native village Khoupum in Noney district, 90 km away from state capital Imphal.

The terrorists ambushed the security convoy at two places in Noney district this morning around 9. There were 20 police vehicles in the convoy which was on road opening patrol duty.

""As soon as the convoy reached Thingkhongjang some heavily armed militants ambushed the team from two sides. The police team too retaliated and the gunfight took place for some minutes. The armed militants reportedly fled the area,"" a statement from Manipur police added.

In the ambush, one constable of Manipur - Yumnam Jenish - was injured and later hospitalised.

Deputy Chief Minister's convoy however passed through the areas safely.  

Police sources added that the ambush might have been carried out to sabotage the Deputy Chief Minister's political campaign.

Later, Congress spokesperson Khumukcham Joykishan Singh alleged that an armed group called Zeliangrong United Front (ZUP) has been openly supporting a BJP candidate  Adim Panmei in Nungba Assembly Constituency."
"Kasab Needs To Go From Uttar Pradesh: What Amit Shah Meant","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kasab-needs-to-go-from-uttar-pradesh-what-amit-shah-meant-1662430","In the battle of acronyms in Uttar Pradesh, where political discourse during campaigning for assembly polls has been increasingly corrosive, Amit Shah today added a new one - KASAB. The name of the 26/11 terrorist, when deconstructed, means Congress, Samajwadi Party and BSP, the BJP president said at a rally today. ""Until Uttar Pradesh gets rid of K-A-S-A-B, there will be no development in the state. Ka (in Hindi) is for Congress, Sa for Samajwadi Party and Ba for BSP,"" Mr Shah said in Chauri Chaura, a historic town in Uttar Pradesh. He did not even finish the last bit, letting the crowd guess it.

Ajmal Kasab, the only among the Pakistani attackers caught after the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, was hanged in 2012.

""Until Kasab is laid to rest, development and prosperity will continue to elude UP,"" Mr Shah said.

Reacting to the BJP chief's dig, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Mau Singhvi said, ""There is a need to end acronyms... BJP's repulsive thinking has been brought out. It shows the party's communal mindset.""

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi came up with SCAM while addressing his first rally in Uttar Pradesh. ""SCAM is Samajwadi, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati,"" he said, drawing a roar of approval from the crowd.

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's reply came in Kanpur, where he said that the word stands for - ""Service, Courage, Ability and Modesty"".

How, wondered PM Modi in parliament, could anyone see anything positive in the word.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made another attempt - ""Save Country from Amit Shah and Modi.""

This week, PM Modi described Mayawati's BSP or Bahujan Samaj Party as ""Behenji Sampatti (property) Party"".

Mayawati shot back, calling BJP ""Bharatiya Jumla (rhetoric) Party"". The former chief minister also used PM Modi's initials to call him ""Mr Negative Dalit Man.""

Uttar Pradesh is half-way through seven-phase voting. The results will be declared on March 11."

An FIR has been filed against him in this regard.

Inspector in-charge of the Civil Lines police station Arun Kumar Tyagi said the FIR was filed upon the complaint of Sector Magistrate Sunil Kumar Singh.

The FIR was followed up by an inquiry ordered by District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar into allegations of Mr Maurya wearing the party sticker on the pocket of his jacket the day he came to cast his vote at a polling booth, set up on the premises of a college in the city on February 23.

Responding to queries from reporters yesterday, Mr Maurya said, ""I did not intentionally go to the polling booth wearing the party sticker. I wear the sticker on my front pocket always and it has become a habit.
""I just forgot to take it off while going inside. I would, however, respect any action taken by the EC in this regard.""

A section of the Representation of the People Act forbids any person to exhibit any notice or sign relating to the election on the day of polling within a distance of 100m of the polling station. Contravention of any of the provisions of the section, which place a number of other restrictions enforceable on polling days, is punishable with fine.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh is halfway through the 2017 assembly elections with the fifth phase of polling for 51 seats, comprising 11 districts, being due on February 27. Campaigning for the same ended on Saturday."
"As Doubts About Rahul Gandhi Grow, Leaders Wonder 'Who Will Bell The Cat?'","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/as-doubts-about-rahul-gandhi-grow-leaders-wonder-who-will-bell-the-cat-1663586","New Delhi: HighlightsCongress suffered a loss in the Maharashtra and Odisha local polls
Officially, they blame infighting and lack of resources for the loss
The party has been losing state after state since the 2014 Union polls
                                The knives are out in the Congress party after it suffered another electoral debacle in the local elections of Maharashtra and Odisha. Officially, the party blames infighting and the lack of financial resources for its poor performance. However, senior leaders within the Congress party have now begun to question the abilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi - albeit in hushed voices.

Sources say, they are waiting for the outcomes of the ongoing elections in five states before raising the pitch of those questions. The big question, as one senior Congress leader says, is ""Who will bell the cat and question him?""

After the party's worst performance in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, Rahul Gandhi has taken the lead and tried to rebuild and campaign for the party across the country. But the results have been far from encouraging. The party has been losing state after state and has been virtually wiped out across the country.

Senior leaders in the party say there is no gameplan or strategy put forth on how to take on the Narendra Modi-led BJP government. Leaders, who requested not to be named, say Rahul Gandhi's attacks have been a non-starter and the recent victory of the BJP in Maharashtra and Odisha will have its impact on the last phase of voting in Uttar Pradesh. They also feel the long-awaited reshuffle will really bring little to the table as accountability and performance have never been the yardstick for the Mr Gandhi's leadership. The demand will, now, once again focus on whether Rahul Gandhi will be made the Congress president and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, play a more pro-active role.

Either way, the Gandhis are well aware that come March 11, any further political reversals will not only mean a big question mark on the Congress but particularly the abilities of party vice president Rahul Gandhi."
"Manipur Elections 2017: Irom Sharmila Picks A David vs Goliath Fight For Thoubal","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-elections-2017-irom-sharmila-picks-a-david-vs-goliath-fight-for-thoubal-1663547","Thoubal:                             With just one week left for Manipur elections, Thoubal is right now the most keenly watched seat in the assembly polls where activist-turned-politician Irom Sharmila is taking on three-time Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh. Far from being dismissive of her, he says, he too began his political career as an independent. But Irom Sharmila wants to be the Chief Minister now.

""I want to be Chief Minister of Manipur and bring real democracy and real true relationship between people and ruler,"" said Irom Sharmila on her campaign trail. She is single minded. But her party- Peoples' Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) - has fielded candidates in only three out of 60 seats. So the math doesn't add up. And her meetings in people's courtyards or at street corners are thinly attended.

Congress rallies are, in contrast, packed. At an inauguration of some Congress candidates, where Ibobi Singh was present, the turnout was huge. Reversed parallels of David versus Goliath are hard to miss.

Mr Ibobi Singh, however, is diplomatic. Even his voters respect Irom Sharmila for her valiant fight against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA in the state. ""Everybody has the right to contest an election. She is my sister, Irom Sharmila. She is most welcome. Let the people decide,"" said Ibobi Singh.

But voters are divided, and sharply. One of them said he had no idea who she was. ""I have heard her name but I have never seen her or heard people talking about her,"" a young man said. Another man, however, is sure Irom Sharmila will win. ""Ibobi will lose,"" he says.

Even Irom Sharmila's own party PRJA is talking of moral victory and the next polls. ""She has struggled campaigning in Thoubal for various reasons. But this is just our first foray into electoral politics. Five years later, I am quite confident we are going to be a much larger party,"" Erendro Leichombam, convenor and candidate of the party said.

A Manipuri tradition is for voters to bring gifts to candidates - rice, vegetables and such. These gifts are pouring in at Congress meetings. Irom Sharmila may not care for this feudal tradition of gifts but she needs votes. She is cycling on. But the ride seems uphill.

Manipur will vote in two phases on March 4 and 8. The counting of votes will take place on March 11."
"What Facts? 'Public Opinion Counts,' Says BJP's Yogi Adityanath","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-facts-public-opinion-counts-says-bjps-yogi-adityanath-1662241","HighlightsBJP MP Yogi Adityanath represents Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur constituency
He is among the BJP's tallest leaders in eastern Uttar Pradesh
He said power supply on Diwali should be 'four times more' than on Eid
                                Yogi Adityanath, BJP lawmaker and star campaigner in Uttar Pradesh, today offered his own, fact-free interpretation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comments on Sunday alleging religious discrimination by the state's Samajwadi Party government.

The PM had said at a rally, ""There should be no discrimination. If there is land given for kabristan (graveyards), there must be provisions for shamshaanghat (crematoriums). Electricity must be provided on Ramzan and Diwali. If there is power for Holi, it must be available for Eid.""

The All India Power Engineers Association however has clarified that on Eid last year, 13,500 MW of electricity was generated, and that on the 4 auspicious days of Diwali, the figure was 15,400 MW per day, suggesting the absence of bias.

To this, the Yogi told this interviewer to ""stop quoting data"". What counts, he said, is public opinion.

""People's anger is evidence. When people come on the streets, no evidence is necessary,"" he insisted.

The saffron-robed lawmaker also asserted, somewhat bizzarely, that he believed that going by the demographics, power supply on Diwali should be ""four times more"" than on Eid.

Yogi Adityanath said he ""agreed with the Prime Minister that SP vikas (development) is limited to graveyards"".

The BJP has alleged that Rs 1,300 crores were allotted for a graveyard scheme compared to Rs 627 crores for crematoriums.

Asked whether the Prime Minister should have laboured a point that involves a fraction of the state's budget of Rs 3.46 lakh crores, the firebrand politician said, ""the Budget should be spent according to the population. It may be a small matter for you""

He then pivoted, making it a larger problem of the misuse, or lack of use, of the state's funds. ""If it is a fraction of the budget, where did the rest of the money go?"", he asked.  

Recently, Yogi Adityanath's supporters in eastern Uttar Pradesh threatened to field rebels if he was not named presumptive Chief Minister in UP, which is half-way through seven-phase elections.

The 44-year-old, however, distanced itself from the rebel outfit. ""The outfit will not damage the BJP's prospects,"" he asserted. ""I am not a candidate. I want a BJP worker to become Chief Minister.""

Yogi Adityanath, a big crowd-puller for the BJP in eastern Uttar Pradesh, has been assigned a chopper to zip across the state to campaign as the party tries to win back the politically vital state after 15 years."
"UP Elections 2017: As Parties Make Promises, Bundelkhand Migrants Say Little Has Changed","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-as-parties-make-promises-bundelkhand-migrants-say-little-has-changed-1662491","Greater Noida:                             As 19 constituencies across seven districts of Bundelkhand prepare to vote in the fourth phase of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, NDTV visited a labour chowk in Greater Noida, which has been a hub for migrants from Bundelkhand for the past two decades.

20-year-old Arvind Varma has been frequenting the labour chowk each day for the last 15 years in search of daily jobs that fetch him around Rs 300 a day.

""There are water problems, no roads and no accountability in Bundelkhand. As labour, it would mean literally walking in to the hands of exploitation,"" says Mr Varma, who now works as a cook at night and a manual labourer by day.

 Drought and declining agriculture forced him and his family to migrate from Jhansi to the outskirts of Dadri nearly 20 years ago, a time when Bundelkhand was severely drought-ridden and one of the poorest regions in the country.

For 35-year-old Pappu, a former-farmer from a neighbouring village in Jhansi who has five family-members to feed by himself, even migration seems to have offered little.

""We get Rs 350 here; in Bundelkhand I would make Rs 150. I am a farmer, so manual work is all I can do. I have heard in the elections some party is promising to cancel all farmers’ debts in Bundelkhand, is that true,"" he asks.

Like Arvind and Pappu, nearly 1,000 Bundelkhandis show up at the Greater Noida labour chowk daily, some travelling for six to seven hours from the heart of UP every day.""

If we don’t have anything to eat, what else will we do? I have come today and will go back tomorrow to cast my vote,” says 47-year-old Bhanwri Devi, from Mahoba. “But what is the point? They make us vote and then smother our faces,"" she adds.

Inder Prakash from Chitrakoot adds, ""There is no employment even here. After the note-ban, we can’t even get our wages. So much for political promises.""

Last year alone drought conditions in Bundelkhand forced nearly 18 lakh people to migrate to Delhi and its neighbouring areas. According to some estimates, nearly 10 per cent of Bundelkhand’s population migrated at that time."
"Assembly Election 2017: Cash, Liquor Seizure Go Through The Roof In 2017","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assembly-election-2017-cash-liquor-seizure-go-through-the-roof-in-2017-1663624","New Delhi:                             The seizure of cash, besides liquor and drugs during the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Punjab this year has witnessed a huge jump from last polls.

Uttar Pradesh has seen record seizure of Rs 115.70 crore cash, 20.29 lakh barrels of liquor worth Rs 57.69 crore, and narcotics weighing 2,725 kg worth Rs 7.91 crore, as per the progressive data recorded till yesterday of seizure made by the Election Commission-appointed surveillance teams.

The comparative figures for the detection and seizure of these illegal inducements in UP during the 2012 Assembly polls stood at Rs 36.29 crore cash and over 3,073 litres of liquor worth Rs 6.61 lakh.

A similar massive increase in seizure has also been noticed in Uttarakhand, where single-phase polls ended early this month, as Rs 3.40 crore suspected cash, 1.01 lakh litres liquor worth Rs 3.10 crore and over 81 kg of drugs worth Rs 37.88 lakh have been seized by these teams till now.

Polling in one seat (Karnprayag) of the state has been postponed as a candidate had died.

The comparative figures for seizure in the hill state during 2012 stood at Rs 1.30 crore cash, 15,151 litres of liquor worth Rs 15.15 lakh among others.

In Punjab, where the polls have ended now, the cash seizure this time stood at Rs 58.02 crore as compared to Rs 11.51 crore last elections, 12.43 lakh litres of liquor worth Rs 13.36 crore as compared to over 3,2978 litres worth Rs 2.59 crore and 2,598 kg drugs worth Rs 18.26 crore as compared to 53 kg worth Rs 54 crore during the 2012 Assembly polls.

Goa too has witnessed a similar trend with Rs 2.24 crore cash being seized at the end of one-phase polls on February 4, over 76,000 litres liquor worth Rs 1.07 crore.

The cash seizure in the beach state during last polls was a mere Rs 60 lakh while the drugs and liquor seizure was very less. The comparative figures of the seizure for Manipur, where polls will be held next month, could not be obtained.

""It looks like demonetisation has not affected those who deal in black money and other illegal inducements used to lure the voters before and during the polls season.

""The surveillance teams are, however, on their toes to thwart these efforts as much as possible,"" a senior Income Tax department official, involved in these operations, said.

The counting of votes for all the five states will take place on March 11.

The campaigning will come to a close at 5 pm for the fifth phase, polling for which will take place on February 27, Office of UP Chief Electoral Officer said in Lucknow today.

The districts going to polls in this phase are Balrampur, Gonda, Faizabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Bahraich, Shravasti, Siddharth Nagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Amethi, and Sultanpur.

Due to death of Samajwadi Party candidate Chandrashekhar Kanaujia in Alapur (Ambedkar Nagar), the EC has announced fresh date of voting in this constituency on March 9.

The ruling Samajwadi Party had won 37 seats out of 52 (total seats in this phase including Alapur) in 2012 Assembly polls while BJP and Congress won five seats each, BSP had won three while Peace party won two seats.

Shravasti, Balrampur, Sultanpur and Ambedkar Nagar had emerged as stronghold of Samajwadi Party with the party winning all the seats there.

In all 608 candidates are in the fray in this phase with maximum of 24 candidates in Amethi and minimum of six each in Kapilvastu and Etwa seats of Siddharth Nagar district.

Prominent contestants in this phase include controversial minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati (SP), who will be facing Amita Singh (Congress) and Garima Singh (BJP) in Amethi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Rahul Gandhi.

Ms Amita is the wife of Congress leader Sanjay Singh, while Ms Garima is his estranged better half.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati were among the host of leaders who made a beeline to backward and water-scarce Bundelkhand region, which also figures in phase-IV of polling.

Assembly segments in Congress President Sonia Gandhi's Raebareli Lok Sabha constituency will also go to polls in this phase.

Other districts going to polls in the fourth phase are Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur.

During the highly surcharged campaigning, PM Modi repeatedly targeted the SP-Congress alliance and the BSP for corruption in their regime.

""SCAM stands for SP, Congress, Mr Akhilesh and Ms Mayawati,"" was PM Modi's refrain when he appealed to the voters of Bundelkhand to get rid of them.

As the prime minister termed BSP as ""Behenji Sampatti Party"", Ms Mayawati in her instant retort said the initials of Narendra Damodardas Modi stood for ""Mr. Negative Dalit Man"", escalating political temperature with such tit-for-tat barbs.

""Narendra Damodardas Modi means Mr. Negative Dalit Man, he is anti-dalit...this negative dalit man does not like that common people give small contributions in running the BSP movement which is also run through donations,"" an irked Ms Mayawati said.

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav held a roadshow in Allahabad, while racing against time BJP president Amit Shah held a parallel roadshow in 'Sangam Nagari', as Allahabad is also called, claiming that the BJP was poised for absolute majority.

Amid the verbal free-for-all, Mr Akhilesh referred to an advertisement of the tourism department of Gujarat, where PM Modi was Chief Minister before assuming the office of prime minister.

Without taking any name, he advised megastar Amitabh Bachchan, ""do not advertise for the donkeys of Gujarat"".

BJP took exception to such ""cheap remarks"", with its UP General Secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak saying, ""After family drama, SP is now dabbling in filmy drama."""

But PRJA has already notched up one small victory over the BJP, and its face for Manipur polls - Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The BJP - that was keen its star campaigner PM Modi holds his election rally at the historic Kangla Fort complex perhaps as a mark of symbolism in politics - has chucked its plan. Kangla Fort wasn't just home to the kings of Manipur, but is also seen as a sacred place in the Manipuri society.

PRJA - that had launched a campaign against using the fort for PM Modi's political rally - had also complained to the Election Commission. The ruling Congress too soon joined the chorus against the location for the PM's rally.

""We analysed (the situation) and felt that we must have a bigger venue. Thus we shifted. First we thought of having it in Kangla though,"" Manipur BJP spokesperson RK Sivachandra told NDTV.

He said the venue for the rally - the only one that the PM would address before the first phase of polling on March 4 - would be a few kilometres away at Langjing Achouba ground, near CRPF Camp in Imphal. The PM is expected to address a second public meeting before the second phase of polling on March 8.

PRJA considers the change of venue a moral victory.

""We feel humbled to have done our part in protecting our sacred Kangla from political profanity,"" said PRJA's convener Erendro Leichombam.

Irom Sharmila, who hadn't eaten a morsel for 16 years to demand scrapping the Armed Forces Special Powers Act that gives security personnel sweeping emergency powers, founded the party last year after she ended her hunger strike."

The explanation came as a riposte to BJP President Amit Shah's barbs questioning her assessment of Mr Gandhi as ""still not mature and needs some time,"" and this despite handing him over the charge of a complex state like Uttar Pradesh.

""Please remember Rahul is still not mature, his age does not allow him to be mature. He is what... in his forties. Please give him time,"" Ms Dikshit had said in an interview to The Times of India on Thursday.

Her comments were quickly lapped up by BJP President Amit Shah, who did not waste any time to ridicule Mr Gandhi saying, ""immature Rahul should be kept at home"" instead of being sent to Uttar Pradesh.

With ""Don't twist my words"" hashtag, Ms Dikshit took to the Twitter on Friday to clarify her comments.

""Rahul has the sensitivity and concern of a mature leader. His words are those of a young, courageous and restless man,"" she stressed.

BJP president had taken a jibe at Congress at his election rally in Azamgarh on Friday saying, ""If he (Mr Gandhi) is not mature enough, why has he been imposed upon Uttar Pradesh? Is this a political laboratory or learning ground for someone?"" Mr Shah stressed that UP's problems require ""men of steel"" to solve them.

""The problems of Uttar Pradesh can be solved only under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" Mr Shah had said with confidence.  

A ""BJP tsunami"" will help his party get two-thirds majority in the 403-member Assembly and put an end to what he called the ""misrule"" of the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party, who have ruled the state by turns for the past 14 years.

The 78-year-old former Delhi Chief Minister was named by the Congress as the party's presumptive Chief Minister for UP, but that arrangement ceased after the party joined hands with the Samajwadi Party, with Akhilesh Yadav as their nominee for the top post."

Last year, the party snatched Assam from the Congress, which had ruled the state for 15 years.

In Manipur, the Congress has been in power for the exact same period. But the similarity ends there. While in Assam, the BJP united all possible allies to boost its prospects, in Manipur, everyone is singing ""Ekla Chalo Re (Go it alone)"".

The BJP's ally NPP, or the National People's Party of former Speaker Purno Sangma, is contesting 21 of the state's 60 seats. In many, it will hurt the BJP. ""We are a part of the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) but in every state, regional parties have their own aspirations and ideas,"" said Vivek Raj Wangkhem, the chief of the party.

While the Naga Peoples' Front (NPF) is also the BJP's friend at the Centre and in Nagaland, it is not in Manipur. The front is contesting 15 seats and in more than seven, it is a straight contest with the BJP.

""In Manipur, BJP and NPF have a lot of difference in ideology,"" said Hinreikhui Kashung, General Secretary of NPF.

To appease the Naga party, the BJP cannot afford to offend the majority Meitei community in Manipur.

""The NPF in its constitution has a paragraph where it states that it promotes the idea that contiguous Naga-inhabited areas in the northeast should be integrated into one administration. This is totally not acceptable to Manipuri people, so partnering with the NPF is not possible here,"" N Biren Singh, senior BJP spokesperson in Manipur told NDTV.

The Congress suspects that the BJP and its allies NPP and NPF have an understanding in the 20 seats in Manipur's hills, where it is weak.

""NPF is a constituent of NDA, they already have an understanding with the BJP and both the parties are hand-in-gloves,"" said G Gaikhamgam, Deputy Chief Minister, Manipur.

BJP has a friendly rival in seats in the plains too. Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party is fighting in 11 seats where the BJP's prospects looked good."

The pilot managed to successfully land the helicopter and everyone is safe, he added.

Delhi BJP media incharge Praveen Shankar Kapoor also said that the helicopter, in which Mr Tiwari was flying with his team, had to force land in Pratapgarh after technical problem, and they are safe.

Mr Tiwari addressed the election meeting and later headed to Varansi by road.

"It's Official. Manohar Parrikar Will Be Back As Goa Chief Minister Tomorrow","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manohar-parrikar-likely-to-take-oath-as-goa-chief-minister-tomorrow-1669043","Panaji: HighlightsManohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa chief minister for the fourth time
He was inducted into the Union Cabinet as defence minister in 2014
BJP staked claim to form government with the support of regional allies
                                Manohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa Chief Minister for the fourth time tomorrow. He declared today that he has resigned from PM Narendra Modi's council of ministers to go back to Goa as its Chief Minister. The incumbent BJP with 13 seats claims to have support of eight other legislators needed to cross the magic mark. Mr Parrikar will have to prove his majority in the assembly within 15 days of swearing in. He will also have to get elected to the state legislature within six months.

For most of the 28 months that he has been the country's Defence Minister, Mr Parrikar has often been called Goa's super chief minister, a reflection of the IIT-Bombay graduate's keen interest in the politics of the state.

Mr Parrikar, 61, had been Chief Minister for a little over two years in his third stint in that post, when he was pulled out of Goa in late 2014 to join PM Modi's cabinet.

Mr Parrikar together with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari held a long meeting on Sunday evening where the BJP efficiently collected the additional seven seats it needs from regional parties. Mr Parrikar then met with Governor Mridula Sinha to stake claim and was invited to form the government.

The BJP staked claim to form government despite placing second to the Congress which has won the most -17- but not enough to form the government - the target is 21.

The BJP legislators in Goa met on Sunday morning and unanimously said they want Mr Parrikar to head their government. The party's former ally the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP with three seats offered their support to the BJP on condition that Mr Parrikar will head the government.

Another regional party Goa Forward, which also won three seats, has provided its support in writing at the meeting on Sunday evening.

There are three independents who have been elected two of whom have promised support to the BJP, earning it the eight extra seats it needs for a majority.

The Congress has accused the BJP of ""murdering the democracy"".  

""Mr Parrikar did not even contest election...no one knows if he is popular among the people of Goa... this is murder of democracy in broad day light,"" said Congress' Priyanka Chaturvedi .

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, in a tweet, said, the ""BJP is stealing elections in Goa, Manipur. Party that comes second has no right to form government,"" he tweeted this morning.

Rejecting the Congress' claim, the BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao said, ""We secured 4 % more popular votes than the Congress, we also have legislative majority to form government."""
"Tainted Lawmakers Decrease; 80 Per Cent Multi-Millionaires In New UP Assembly","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/tainted-lawmakers-decrease-80-per-cent-multi-millionaires-in-new-up-assembly-1669525","Lucknow:                             For those worried about electing criminals into the posts of public representatives, the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections provide some solace: In the new 403-member house, lawmakers with criminal antecedents have gone down to 36.

In the 2012 elections, a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and Election Watch says, 45 candidates with criminal cases against them had won. 

However, money power continues to rule the roost as 80 per cent of the new MLAs are multi-millionaires, the report says.

The richest legislator, as per affidavits submitted to the Election Commission, is Shah Alam of BSP from Mubarakpur. He asserts amount to Rs. 117 crore.

Political observers see the decline in the number of winners from among those wielding muscle power as a ""good sign for politics and democracy"". 

Veteran journalist Rajiv Ranjan Jha says the decline in the number of MLAs with a criminal track record was certainly a ""heartwarming feeling"".

""For the last two decades, criminals have ruled the roost in the corridors of power. There have been efforts to minimise it, but such measures have so far failed,"" he added. 

He said there seems to be some churning among the voters against such candidates. 

The list of multi-millionaires includes Shah Alam (Bahujan Samaj Party), Rani Pakshalika Singh (Bharatiya Janata Party), Vinay Shankar (BSP), Gopal Nandi (BJP), Ajay Pratap Singh (BJP), Subhash Past (Samajwadi Party), Sahendra Singh (Rashtriya Lok Dal) and Om Kumar (BJP).

Of these, most have assets valued at over Rs. 25 crore."
"How BJP's UP Win Will Impact Presidential Election. Numbers Explained","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/how-bjps-up-win-will-impact-presidential-election-numbers-explained-1669025","New Delhi: HighlightsPresidential Election is due in July this year
President is elected by Electoral College - formed by 776 MPs, 4120 MLAs
BJP's huge win in UP will also improve the party's tally in Rajya Sabha
                                The BJP's electoral tsunami in Uttar Pradesh will not just dramatically change the party's numbers in the assembly but will have an immediate impact on the next Presidential elections in July when President Pranab Mukherjee completes his term.

For National Democratic Alliance or NDA the path to having its nominee elected as the next President has become much easier after the BJP and its allies won 325 lawmakers in UP, 57 in Uttarakhand and impressive 21 in Manipur. Since the results, the BJP has announced it is all set take charge in the state, claiming it has support of 31 legislators.

The President of India is elected by an electoral college that's formed by 776 parliamentarians and 4,120 legislators. The total strength of the electoral college is 10,98,882 votes and the halfway mark is 5,49,442 votes.

The NDA is now short of only about 25,000 votes and friendly parties like the Biju Janata Dal, AIADMK can easily bridge the deficit. But hours after its landslide, party president Amit Shah played down the numbers edge in the run up to the Presidential polls.

""The Electoral College is there and it will do its job,"" Mr Shah told reporters.

Next year, these results will also change the dynamics in the Rajya Sabha where the NDA government is in minority. In August 2018, 10 Rajya Sabha members of UP including BSP chief Mayawati will retire.

Of these 10 vacancies, majority will go to the BJP. The Bahujan Samaj Party, with just 19 lawmakers in a house of 403, will struggle to get Mayawati re-elected to the Rajya Sabha.

Overall 58 members will retire next August and the BJP is expected to get at least half of these seats.

But the numbers don't seem to deter the Congress. ""Yes, these numbers will give them the confidence but election arithmetic is different from raising people's issue,"" said PC Chacko, senior member of the party who's now overseeing the party's preparation for civic polls in Delhi next month.

Mr Chacko says it is their pressure that ""forced the Modi government to go back on the Land Acquisition Bill or more recently the issue of making Aadhar mandatory to avail benefits of the Midday meal scheme.""

""We will continue to oppose the Government where it is necessary,"" Mr Chacko said."

At a weekly meeting of lawmakers on Thursday, party president Amit Shah offered a laddoo from the famous Tirupati temple in Andhra Pradesh's Chittoor to Prime Minister Modi - brought by a lawmaker as blessings of Lord Balaji - and immediately informed his colleagues that they begin preps for he BJP's next big target, the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The party will hit the ground running. It has planned a week-long outreach programme to mark Dalit icon Bhim Rao Ambedkar's birth anniversary on April 14. The celebrations, which will start on April 6, the BJPs' foundation day, will be held in every panchayat ward in the country in an attempt to reach out to the Dalit community.

PM Modi has also asked party leaders to give a boost during that week to digital payment platform BHIM - short for Bharat Interface for Money which he dedicated to Ambedkar - by educating the masses about it, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar told reporters.

The laddoos, enough for all, celebrated the BJP's spectacular performance in assembly elections this weekend. The party has swept crucial Uttar Pradesh and also Uttarkhand and has managed to install governments it leads in Goa and Manipur. At today's meeting of party MPs, the architects of the wins, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah were felicitated. The BJP has pegged the election results as a victory of PM Modi's leadership and the people's verdict on his ban on 500 and 1000 rupee notes in November, aimed at eliminating tax evasion.    

Home Minister Rajnath Singh proposed a resolution to thank voters of the states where elections were held and the BJP's workers for their success. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley supported the resolution that was passed unanimously,  Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said."

""Party that comes second has no right to form government,"" he tweeted this morning.

The response comes a day after the BJP announced that it is all set to form government in Goa and Manipur, claiming it has support of majority legislators.

Manohar Parrikar, who will take oath as Goa Chief Minister tomorrow evening, met with Governor Mridula Sinha on Sunday and was invited to form the government. Mr Parrikar today said that he has resigned as union Defence Minister.

Accusing the BJP of ""murdering the democracy"", Congress' Priyanka Chaturvedi said, ""Mr Parrikar did not even contest election...no one knows if he is popular among the people of Goa... this is murder of democracy in broad day light.""

Rejecting the allegation, BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao said, ""We secured 4 per cent more popular votes than the Congress, we also have legislative majority to form government... they (Congress) don't have.""

Goa has 40 seats of which the Congress won 17, falling short of the magic number 21. The BJP, which is the incumbent, won 13. Many regional parties have extended their support to the BJP in Goa on a condition - Mr Parrikar will lead the government.

In Manipur, the BJP claims to have support of 31 legislators after scoring 21 seats in 60 seats assembly. Congress got the maximum seats - 27.

""We have letters of 30 MLAs and the 31st will send a letter to the Governor,"" said Himanta Biswa Sarma, who had joined the BJP from the Congress.

G Gaikhangam, Deputy Chief Minister of Manipur, said: ""The Chief Minister (Okram Ibobi) has staked claims (to form government)... we are the single largest party we should be invited first to take a floor test.""

Mr Chidambaram comment comes a day after he acknowledged PM Narendra Modi as ""the most dominant political leader"" in the country.

PM Modi exhaustive campaign in UP won the BJP the strongest result for any party since 1977 in India's politically most-strategic state. The BJP won all but 76 of the state's 403 seats."

Attributing the party's victory to the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, Mr Bhatt said said that the party cadres worked hard against a ""non-performing"" and ""corrupt"" government.

""We worked as watchmen and always exposed the truth which seems to have paid off,"" he said.

But women haven't done as well when it comes to holding elected offices.

Only five women have been elected to the state assembly in the just-concluded elections; 62 of the over 630 candidates in the fray this year were women. The outgoing assembly too had only five women lawmakers.

Between the Congress and the BJP, the two big parties fielded just 12 candidates including eight from the Congress. Three won from the BJP, and two from the Congress.

BJP leader Sushila Baluni, also a prominent name in movement for a separate state, said she congratulated the women who made it. ""But this is not the Uttarakhand that I and countless other daughters of the hills had struggled for,"" she said.

The former chairperson of the state's women panel said ""recognising the importance of women's role in politics is the beginning of recognising their role in democracy.""

Among the three women who made it from the BJP is a politician who joined from the Congress, Rekha Arya and the daughter of a former chief minister, Ritu Khanduri Bhushan. The third was Meena Gangola from Gangolighat who won with a little over eight hundred votes.

From the Congress, the two successful lawmakers include Mamta Rakesh who took the plunge in electoral politics from Bhagwanpur seat after her husband's death in 2015. She defeated her brother-in-law Subodh Rakesh by over two thousand votes, retaining the seat she had first won in a by poll.

Three-time legislator Indira Hridayesh, also made it. She was a senior minister in the Harish Rawat government who defeated the BJP's Jogendra Rautela, who is the Haldwani Mayor."

Digvijaya Singh, the Congress leader in-charge of Goa described it as a ""great victory,"" though he did not explain his comments. The party's lawyer and senior leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it was important that the court heard the Congress petition ""patiently on a holiday"" and that ""the Governor's decision has been interfered with.""

""If someone wants to be Chief Minister for two days, he is welcome,"" Mr Singhvi said about BJP leader Manohar Parrikar, who has got a go-ahead from the top court to take oath as Goa Chief Minister this evening.

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi alleged that the BJP has used ""money power"" to annex power in Goa. He accused the party of ""misusing the governor's post.""

The Congress had moved the top court against Goa Governor Mridula Sinha inviting the BJP to form government in the state despite the Congress winning more seats in the assembly elections. The court did not accept the Congress' plea to stop Mr Parrikar from taking oath this evening and said he must prove that he has majority support on Thursday. The Congress has won 17 seats, the BJP has won 13 but moved fast to secure the support of smaller parties. A party must have the support of 21 MLAs in the 40-member assembly to form government.

The Congress says it too has 21 and should have been consulted by the Governor as the largest party before she invited the BJP.    

""If you had the numbers, you would have held a dharna (protest) at the Governor's house,"" the Supreme Court said today, adding that the Congress' petition to the court or the Governor does not provide proof of the majority support that it claims it has. The BJP has given the governor letters of support from its new allies.

Governor Sinha had given Mr Parrikar 15 days to prove he has majority support. The court asked him to take the vote in two days. The BJP has said it would've taken a floor test immediately anyway.

""I am grateful the court heard us. I believe the Governor's decision has been interfered with,""  Mr Singhvi said."

"Arvind Kejriwal Alleges EVM Tampering. Do Vipassana, Says Harsimrat Kaur","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-alleges-tampering-of-evms-in-punjab-assembly-elections-1669675","New Delhi: HighlightsArvind Kejriwal said 20-25% of AAP votes transferred to Akali-BJP combine
EVMs banned by nations abroad as they can be tampered with, he said
Mr Kejriwal has called for use of ballot papers in Delhi municipal polls
                                Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today raised questions about the Electronic voting machines in the Punjab assembly polls, saying 20 per cent to 25 per cent of AAP votes were transferred to the Akali-BJP coalition which was in power in the state. The number of votes polled by his party were far less in some areas than the number of volunteers the party, he said, adding the results fly in the face of predictions by several exit polls and political experts.

Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, daughter in-law of Akali Dal Chief Parkash Singh Badal, was quick to hit back. ""He (Kejriwal) has lost his mental balance so he is saying things like this. He did not say anything when AAP had won 67 seats in Delhi... He should do vipassana,"" she told reporters.

In his first interaction with the media after the results of the assembly elections were declared, Mr Kejriwal said his party was expected to win the elections. ""What then, went wrong? There was no word of Congress coming to power... yet they swept the elections... really don't know how that happened,"" he said.

The Congress had won 77 of Punjab's 117 seats. All exit polls had predicted a hung house for Punjab - the poll of exit polls had suggested that Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party would be neck and neck with the Congress.

Electronic Voting Machines, Mr Kejriwal said, had been banned by some nations abroad because they can be tampered with. To conduct free and fair polls in India, they should be discontinued. ""Our Supreme Court had said in the past that it is possible to tamper with EVMs. I'm not saying this, the Supreme Court said this,"" he said.

Citing an example, Mr Kejriwal said, ""In (Punjab's) Shri Govindpur we got 1 vote... there are 5 volunteers who swear they voted for us... similar instances across the state... where did all the votes go? There is something seriously wrong.""

Mr Kejriwal demanded that the votes registered in the EVMs be compared with the VVPAT trail (voter-verified paper audit trail) in nearly 32 places in Punjab. ""It is about the credibility of the Election Commission and the faith of people in the electoral system. We have strong prima facie evidence of foul play,"" he said.

After the BJP's sweeping victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections and the dismal performance of her own party, Mayawati had called for a switch to ballot papers, alleging that EVMs or Electronic Voting Machines, make rigging easy.

Mr Kejriwal has called for the use of ballot papers in the coming municipal elections in Delhi - a request that has been turned down by the Election Commission, which said such a change requires more time than it at hand. The civic elections are due on April 22."

The youth make up for over half of Uttarakhand's 75 lakh voters, half of them in the 19-29 age group.

Mr Rawat said somewhere, a major trust-deficit existed on the part of the youth towards him and his party.

""The whole of Uttarakhand wanted change and youngsters are included in that. Still, I would like to tell youngsters that we will continue to fulfil our major poll promises, but now while sitting in opposition,"" the chief minister told NDTV.

In the run-up to the elections, Mr Rawat had promised the youth free smart phones, jobs to 20 lakh and control distress-migration of youth from the state by 2022.

But how did the youth of Uttarakhand respond?

""There's a difference between claims and evidence. Change is necessary, for after all, development only happens when a new government comes to power,"" said 22 year old Prateek, a student from Chakrata.

""I have voted for Modi in these elections. I don't know about leaders from Uttarakhand, but Modi has an image which resonates with the youngsters across the state. Only he can do something for the youth,"" said 21-year-old Aryaveer Kothiyal.

Manohar Parrikar will take oath as Goa Chief Minister today
Congress has filed a plea at the Supreme Court to stop his oath ceremony
                                One day after Goa Governor Mridula Sinha invited the BJP to form the government, senior Congress leaders are coming under attack from some of its prominent lawmakers who are angry that their leaders weren't as quick as the BJP to negotiate support from smaller parties and stake claim despite its higher numbers.

The Congress had emerged as the single largest party with 17 legislators and reportedly had the support from an independent in the 40-seat assembly. It was just three short of the majority mark of 21. But it was the BJP - which had just 13 legislators - that ended up with the invite.

On Monday evening, the Congress knocked on the Supreme Court's doors in Delhi to stop Manohar Parrikar - who quit as Defence Minister earlier in the day - from taking oath on Tuesday evening. The petition has argued that the Governor should not have invited the BJP, but the Congress by virtue of the mandate to the party.

Back in Goa, state Congress leaders are not too sure if it is too late.

One of the more vocal critics of the party leadership was the Congress leader Vishwajit P Rane, the leader of opposition in the outgoing Goa assembly who many believed was in the running for the chief minister's job.
 Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has accused the BJP of buying votesOn their target was the Congress general secretary and the party's in-charge for Goa, Digvijaya Singh, who accused the BJP of buying support.

""Money power has won over people's power. I apologise to the people of Goa as we couldn't muster the support to form the government,"" Mr Singh tweeted. Former Union Minister P Chidambaram had also accused the BJP of stealing the elections.

Mr Rane felt Congress party leaders had to take the blame.

 ""I think there was total mismanagement by the leadership,"" Mr Rane told NDTV, asserting that the people had given the Congress mandate to form the government but lost the opportunity ""because of foolishness of our leaders"".

Mr Rane, who had stormed out of the Congress legislature meeting, hinted that the party shouldn't take him for granted. ""There is a lot of pressure on me by all my MLAs supporting me to act but I am only holding back because of my leader Mrs Sonia Gandhi,"" he said.

Is he thinking about quitting the party?

""A lot of thoughts are coming in my mind. Sometimes I just feel that I am in the wrong party,"" said Mr Rane, also the son of Goa's five-time Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane.

Some other legislators such as Jennifer Monserrate - who told journalists how the party leaders had let the opportunity to slip through its fingers - wished that its central leaders had worked as hard and efficiently as Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, the BJP's point person for the state.

It was Mr Gadkari who had overseen the BJP's legislature party meet that named Mr Parrikar as their leader after the BJP's former ally, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP, promised support of its three legislators on the condition that Mr Parrikar heads the government. Another regional party, Goa Forward, which also won three seats, also provided its support in writing on Sunday evening. Of the three Independents, two have also supported the BJP."
"PM Modi's Big Election Win Will Have 'Implications' On Sino-India Ties: Chinese Media","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modis-big-election-win-will-have-implications-on-sino-india-ties-chinese-media-1670190","Beijing:                             The BJP's landslide victory in state polls has ""implications"" for Sino-India ties as it could further embolden Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""hard-line attitude"" and pose difficulties for ""compromises"" in disagreements with countries like China, an opinion in China's official media said today. ""(Prime Minister) Modi recently led his Bharatiya Janata Party to a sweeping electoral victory in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most-populous state, as well as garnering vigorous support in several other major state elections,"" an op-ed in the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC)-run Global Times said.

In the first commentary by the Chinese state media after the poll results, the article said the results, ""not only increased Prime Minister Modi's chance to win in India's 2019 general elections, some even predict he is already set for a second term"".

""Since Beijing-New Delhi ties have recently entered a subtle and delicate phase, observers soon started to pay close attention to how the bilateral relationship will develop after (Prime Minister) Modi tightens his grip on power,"" it said.

Describing Narendra Modi as a ""man of action"" with a ""hard-line attitude"", the article said India's domestic and international polices have undergone change under him.

""(Prime Minister) Modi's hard-line attitude is embodied in both his domestic policies, such as the ban on high-value currency notes, and in his diplomatic logic,"" it said.

""In the international arena, he changed India's previous attitude of trying never to offend anyone and started to take a clear stance in controversies among other nations to maximise its own interests. He enhanced New Delhi's ties with China and Moscow and applied to be a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Yet he also upgraded defence collaboration with the US and Japan, articulated his support for the US rebalance to the Asia-Pacific strategy and Washington's stance on the South China Sea issue,"" it stated.

""If Modi wins the next election (2019), India's current firm and tough manner is bound to continue. It will be without question good news for the country's own development,"" it said.

""Nevertheless, it will likely mean more difficulties in making compromises in rows with other countries. Take the border disputes between Beijing and New Delhi. No silver lining has yet emerged and (Prime Minister) Modi demonstrated his firm stance over the issue by celebrating Diwali, India's biggest holiday, with soldiers at the Sino-India border,"" it said.

""But while seeming inflexible on the surface, hard-liners also have powerful strength in coming to an agreement with others once they make up their mind, given their executive ability and high efficiency,"" it said.

""That said, we can still be optimistic in resolving our divergences, including border disputes, with New Delhi during (Prime Minister) Modi's term as long as both sides are willing,"" it said.

""For China, it is also an opportunity to give more consideration over how to make breakthroughs in Beijing-New Delhi relations with a hard-line Indian government,"" the article claimed.

Last year, Sino-India ties hit multiple roadblocks after China blocked India's admission into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), as well as blocking a United Nations ban on terrorist Masood Azhar and over the construction of the 46-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

This year began on a positive note, with both sides holding an upgraded Strategic Dialogue covering almost all aspects of the relations which both sides termed as very positive."
"Uttarakhand Top Job Contenders: Heavyweights, Turncoats And The Dark Horse","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/uttarakhand-top-job-contenders-heavyweights-turncoats-and-the-dark-horse-1669181","Dehradun: HighlightsBJP won the Uttarakhand assembly election by a landslide
The chief minister will be decided by the party's parliamentary board
Aspirants include Satpal Maharaj, Prakash Pant, TS Rawat, among others
                                Uttarakhand voters have spoken their mind, giving the BJP eight out of every ten assembly seats that went up for polls. Now it is the BJP leadership's turn, to pick one out of the state's long list of aspirants that includes turncoats, heavy-weights including former chief ministers and low-profile leaders - encouraged by the party's choices in Maharashtra and Haryana - hoping to be the proverbial dark horse.

In all, the party netted 56 out of 69 seats for which the results have been declared. The results in one seat will be announced after the re-poll in one polling booth on March 15. The BJP parliamentary board is expected to name the party's chief minister the next day.

Satpal Maharaj, a former Congressman who joined the BJP in 2014, after quitting the Congress on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections, is considered a key contender for the state's top post. Son of a spiritual master and a former Union Minister, he worked as a foot-soldier for two years before getting the ticket.

""Satpal Maharaj's contesting from the hill district of Pauri moves the political geography of Uttarakhand away from the plains to the hills. This may work in his favour,"" said a BJP leader.

The former Congress leader, however, has competition from Trivendra Singh Rawat, the BJP leader who also oversaw the party's affairs in Jharkhand earlier as the state in-charge. Rawat is believed to have the confidence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah and could have, in the words of a senior state BJP leader, ""be preferred by the party cadre over Satpal Maharaj"".

Prakash Pant, the Pithoragarh lawmaker who had PM Modi address an election rally in his constituency, is seen as another high-profile contender. The first speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly, Pant was also among the state leaders to rush to Delhi after counting ended.

And then, there are close to six candidates including four former CMs: Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Maj General BC Khanduri (retd), Ramesh Pokhriyal and Vijay Bahuguna who had joined the party from the Congress last year. There is speculation they might try to push their nominees if they don't make it.

A BJP leader Yatishwaranand, who defeated the Congress' Harish Rawat in his Haridwar Rural consistency, and Harak Singh Rawat, the former Congress leader who contested from Kotdwar seat, had also queued up. Some leaders suggested that party brass could also go for someone who had a toehold in state politics but yet wasn't deeply entrenched, someone like the party's national spokesperson who hails from Uttarakhand, Anil Baluni."
"Congress Asks Why Is BJP Invited To Form Government In Goa","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/congress-asks-why-is-bjp-invited-to-form-government-in-goa-1669004","New Delhi:                             The Congress has objected to the BJP being invited to take charge of Goa. In a letter to the Governor, the Congress said despite emerging as the single-largest party after assembly elections results were declared on Saturday, the governor had invited the BJP to form the government - a move ""not constitutionally permissible"". Preempting a similar announcement in Manipur, it has also sent a letter claiming first right to form the government.

""As per well-established constitutional convention and propriety, the single largest party is invited to form the government and prove its majority on the floor of the House. It has come to our notice that through media reports that BJP has been invited to form the Government and the oath is scheduled on 14th March 2017,"" Congress said in a letter to Goa Governor Mridula Sinha. The party has also sent a similar letter to the Manipur Governor Najma Heptulla, sources said.

Ms Sinha had invited the BJP to form the government after it staked claim, saying it had the support of eight additional legislators required over its 13 to form a majority in the 40-member assembly. Three legislators each of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party or MGP and Goa Forward party and two independents have lent support to the party. The Congress and its allies had won 18 seats.

The letter from the Governor's office said that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who maintained till late Sunday evening that he had not resigned, has been appointed Goa Chief Minister - one of the key conditions of the allies and an unanimous demand of the BJP's own legislators. He will have to prove his majority in the assembly within 15 days of taking charge.

But the Congress says that Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost both the constituencies he fought was a sign of the people's firm rejection of the BJP.

""Our political opponents (BJP) despite losing the mandate of the people have tried to misrepresent to your good-self that they enjoy the majority support of legislators. This is not only opportunism of the lowest kind but is also not constitutionally permissible,"" it said.

The party claimed it too had the required numbers to form government and were in ""a position to prove the same on the floor of the House""."
"PM Narendra Modi Congratulates Record Number of Women In New UP Assembly","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-congratulates-record-number-of-women-in-new-up-assembly-1669094","Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed Holi by calling for a ""new India"" at the victory speech on Sunday, as BJP celebrated the party's elating performance in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday expressed happiness to see a new record of highest number of women MLAs elected to the new Uttar Pradesh Assembly.

""Glad that a new record has been set of highest women MLAs elected in UP assembly. Congratulations to all women MLAs,"" Mr Modi tweeted while sharing an online news item.

The BJP won 312 of the 403 seats in the state assembly and, with 39.007 per cent of the vote, almost matched its record in Uttar Pradesh during 2014 general election, claiming the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades.

The mega UP election which was held in seven rounds establishes the success of PM Modi as a brand and his massive campaigning. The results also confirmed to PM Modi's demonetisation drive that was announced before the elections aiming at rooting out corruption and counterfeit currency. 

BJP leaves the final call to party chief Amit Shah, to decide on who will lead Uttar Pradesh as its Chief Minister. 

PM Modi responded to a media report stating that there will be a record of 38 women MLAs in attendance this term in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly, the highest since Independence.

"Arvind Kejriwal Says Winning And Losing Will Be Part Of AAP's Political Adventure","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-says-winning-and-losing-will-be-part-of-aaps-political-adventure-1670370","New Delhi:                             After AAP's defeat in Punjab in the assembly elections, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that winning or losing is part of the ""political adventure"". He told AAP volunteers there was no reason for the party to give up.

In a break from his combative tone, where he has even questioned the reliability of the electronic voting machines (EVM), Mr Kejriwal urged volunteers to ""keep the faith"" alive. He will be interacting with the volunteers through Facebook Live on March 18, an AAP leader said.

""We will need time to fully understand the 'why and how' of these results. However, before thinking about what next, we need to understand that winning and losing will be part of our political adventure. The BJP has 18 seats and 20 per cent vote share in Karnataka and the Congress 15 seats and 18 per cent vote share in Maharashtra. They have not given up and there is no reason for us to give up,"" Mr Kejriwal wrote in a letter sent to all registered volunteers.

The letter, however, skips the issue of alleged rigging of voting machines in Punjab as raked up by the AAP chief yesterday. ""Although we did not get the expected results, we are now the opposition in Punjab. Also, we have got six per cent votes in Goa and we are just one state away from becoming a national party,"" he said.

Mr Kejriwal has alleged that EVM tampering may have led to the transfer of around 20-25 per cent of the AAP votes to the SAD-BJP combine. The Akalis got a drubbing in the Punjab polls, winning just 15 seats in the 117-strong assembly, while its ally BJP won three. The AAP finished a distant second behind the victor Congress, winning just 20 seats.

""You believed in us when we took our first baby step, had no experience in contesting elections, and did not know whether we could win even a single seat. Keep the faith, keep up the fight, Hum honge kamyaab,"" he said.

"PM Narendra Modi 'Favourite' To Win 2019 Lok Sabha Elections: US Experts","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-favourite-to-win-2019-lok-sabha-elections-us-experts-1669233","Washington: HighlightsTop US experts say PM Modi is ""favourite"" to lead India after 2019
2017 UP election has proved that BJP's 2014 win wasn't an ""aberration""
However, BJP is unlikely to get a simple majority in 2019, said an expert
                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged as a clear favourite for the 2019 general elections after the BJP's landslide victory in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, top US experts on India have said. While one of the experts noted that the electoral results of the recently concluded Assembly polls in five states show that the 2014 Lok Sabha election results were not an aberration, another noted that Prime Minister Modi would continue to lead India after 2019.

The Assembly elections do not signal much of a change. The Uttar Pradesh election results showed that the 2014 general elections were not an ""aberration,"" Adam Ziegfeld, Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at the George Washington University said. ""It was a big win for the BJP. Its candidates won with a much larger margin of victory as compared to the two previous winners - BSP and Samajwadi Party,"" he said.

Prime Minister Modi has been established by this election as the ""clear and favourite winner"" for the 2019 general elections, Sadanand Dhume, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute said. ""PM Modi is the front runner (for 2019),"" he said.

However, Irfan Nooruddin, a professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service at the Georgetown University predicted that in 2019, the BJP is unlikely to be get a simple majority and that Prime Minister Modi would likely be heading a coalition government. BJP is running a disciplined election campaign state-by-state, while the Opposition fails, he said. ""The party does not do well in a state where it faces a direct opposition. BJP is beatable if the Opposition comes together,"" Mr Nooruddin said, adding that the party gains where it faces a fragmented opposition. He also said that by 2019, anti-incumbency would kick in.

""In this election, the BJP played the cast card while pretending to be above it,"" Sadanand Dhume, who was in Uttar Pradesh during the elections, said. ""Demonetisation was extremely popular. Indian people who have suffered themselves in the wake of the policy, it won their heart and mind. Here is this man of sincerity who struck a principled blow to corrupt and the rich,"" he said referring to his conversation with people in the state.

Mr Dhume, however, says that PM Modi after this historic victory in Uttar Pradesh is unlikely to go for the kind of economic reforms the private sector would like to have.

India is going to bump up its economic reforms that directly affects the people of the country, said Alyssa Ayres, senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. Picking up four governments in states all across India, and having future prospects, it is unlikely to have an impact on foreign policy. Like demonetisation #IamNewIndia is the pledge that the Prime Minister is asking citizens to be part of. This is his new India campaign.

BJP will now pick up a lot of seats in Rajya Sabha which would help the ruling party to carry out its long pending reform like the land acquisition reform and labor reforms. They would tart picking up seats as early as 2018. BJP is looking at 2019 and beyond."
"PM Narendra Modi Uses Victory Speech To Counter Criticism, Urge Humility","http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hardest-working-pm-they-say-this-will-continue-pm-narendra-modi-1668965","New Delhi: HighlightsPM thanked voters of the states whose results were declared yesterday
The victory celebration was attended by senior BJP leaders and ministers
PM Modi also attended a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board
                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi discarded his fortified SUV to walk a short distance to the BJP office in Delhi today which was surrounded by party workers waiting to celebrate him. As he moved past, flowers rained down on him as elite commandos in combat gear circled their VVIP.

The celebrations for the outsized results in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were turned by the BJP into a launchpad for future elections.

PM Modi thanked the voters of the five states whose results were declared yesterday and used his victory speech to counter criticism. The party has been rebuked by opponents and others for not fielding a single Muslim candidate in Uttar Pradesh. ""The BJP government is for those who have voted, (and) not voted for the party... no government has the right to discriminate. People are with or against some party only till the time of voting. Now, the UP government belongs to the people of UP,"" he said.

Top cabinet ministers, organisational leaders and Chief Ministers of different states were in attendance as Mr Modi was thanked for his leadership.

Political opponents charge his government with rising arrogance. The PM cautioned his party in a speech that was frequently interrupted by cheers of ""Modi, Modi"" that ""We have reached this position after hard work by four generations...winning requires us to be more humble. A tree may grow tall, but it can bend if it bears lots of fruit.""

To stress that outright landslide wins which have decimated the opposition will not result in over-confidence, the PM said, ""We may makes mistakes, but we will always be well-intentioned. We will work our hardest,"" he said (his punishing schedule is well-acknowledged), adding that, ""I am the first PM who is often asked about working so hard. We will always serve the people.""

If there was one over-riding theme to his speech, it was that there is a ""New India"" that is centered on its youth, and its aspirations, and its willingness to bear difficulties in the larger interest of progress, a reference to his demonetisation drive that was ridiculed by opponents but has been welcomed by the people.

It is now accepted even by rivals that his re-election is certain in 2019. The PM too suggested that he is drafting his agenda for a second term, highlighting that progress on key areas must be delivered ""by 2022 - when the country would be celebrating 75 years of independence.""

Pro-poor policies like free gas connections for the rural poor have served the BJP well in these elections, and the PM stressed, ""There is a need to raise aspirations among the poor to find opportunities to do better.""

In concert with this was his focus on development, which he described as ""a tough issue to highlight in a campaign...for 50 years, parties have been afraid to use this plank.""

His assertion that the BJP is going through a golden period has unquestionable evidence. The sea of BJP workers certainly agreed. They cheered him as he walked by. They danced in the street to patriotic songs. And each time they caught a glimpse of him on the plasma screens relaying his speech, they shouted his name."
